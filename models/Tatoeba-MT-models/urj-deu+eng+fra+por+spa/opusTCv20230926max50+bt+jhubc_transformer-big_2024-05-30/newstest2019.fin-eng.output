Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to a home win in the opening - Savo Volley wins second
Hurricane-Loimaa, who won seven men's volleyball championship medals in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio Loimau fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective of the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
Things got settled pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpune, who played Loimussak, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most efficient of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience from the other side, and that added extra extra to the game.
Our game isn’t ready yet, but of course the goal is to continue the medal pipeline,” Kouki said.
Savo Volley 's
With 18 points, Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective when the team knocked down the Vanetaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attacking head, but luckily we managed to squeeze the win.
At least I didn’t have any conscious download when I was playing against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Volleyball in the season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the ceiling all the time.
Good feeling from the home opening.
Miro was a king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Sampo in Pielavesi, while Tuovisen was also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012–13 league points exchange, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening victory after defeating Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun well on its own.
Today we were close to losing, as we were losing 17-21 in the fourth round.
We dug up a round win, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the Tigers in the finals was the 28-point chipper Edvarts Buivids.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much hold of the guy's chopper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranks number one in the world in comparison to human capital
Finland is at the forefront of the world in the comparison of human capital, according to the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one of the highest, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst-ranked countries.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois keeps Atletico in check, the local game ends goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to the backs, and the Madrid teams' local match ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian watchman Courtois was defeated.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
Earlier this week, the FIFA International Football Federation chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale scored the best goal in Real Madrid, but his shot was missed at the end of the opening half.
Bale went to the exchange after a break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goal cannon that was transferred to Juventus.
Abortion law is under attack in the United States, a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive vote will reverse the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come about over the years.
Incredible as it may seem, this topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received support from the majority of our country’s parliamentarians to various degrees.
Colleen McNicholas is the only abortion practitioner in Missouri.
Armed guards at the clinic say they defend religious freedom in the United States.
The news videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
It was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a consortium of Lutheran ecclesiastical men guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died of a self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
The Republican Party, in particular, advocated the legalization of abortion.
In 1967, the California abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, who dramatically began mixing religion with politics to gather voters.
His abortion stance was also reversed by his successor, George Bush the Elder.
Donald Trump did the same.
The documentary reaches the deepest point of the matter in its search for a basis for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations advocating racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes to politics.
At the time of writing this, the United States is in a situation where the president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but captured the votes of the religious right with his abortion stick, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now being accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh will have the power to rule on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations on the border
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in the past six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
Among the dead were two children, 12- and 14-year-old boys, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the ministry, 505 people were injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an air strike on the border area as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has started using force so that protesters do not break up the border fence or try to reach the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since the weekly start of Palestinian border protests in March.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 people were injured.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families enter the areas that the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have set fire to forests and farmland in Israel.
Punishment - Punishment - Punishment - Punishment - Punishment
Wigan's top pair Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Santa Claus couldn’t believe his eyes.
Ward, the referee, sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0-win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued to play until the end.
He set goals and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, it was the fifth game in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
Pedophile service was immediately filled with reservations - In Finland, about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women have at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for people who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
SeriE, a joint project between the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails began at Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly,” Yle says.
These will be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children brings shame to many.
Most of those who are self-conscious of pedophilia have not realised their fantasies and thus have done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Ylele, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence," Thesleff said.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the prize, based on the odds of betting.
Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least on a verbal level.
The most popular winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace deal between their two countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is remarkable, as last year the gaps were still freezing.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years and who has been leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the one that receives the most attention: the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to participants in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates will be Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been the victims of mass rape and has become the world’s leading specialist in his field.
In his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, is also a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 nominees this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump wouldn’t mind getting the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
"Everyone thinks so, but I would never say that," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
“The prize I want is a victory for the whole world,” he said, referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are some things that make Trump’s Nobel improbable.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often awarded recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – just the kind of international co-operation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would require an ideological reversal from the Nobel Committee.
Fire in Tunnel: Drivers behaved like thugs and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 Lohja occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted in both Turku and Helsinki directions.
When it became clear that there was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are motorists on the road in shock and they drive as they please," the on-call firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
At the time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, says Tapio Heiskanen, the contact manager at the Finnish Transport Safety Agency.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels are not allowed to stop unless there is a compelling reason.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, one cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to run as smoothly as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is forbidden, as is the case with reversing and turning back.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels where headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also forbidden, as is parking.
There have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” says Heiskanen in a press release.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration even though the ship was trapped at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans carried by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the bow at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the collision.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by the fire department to the harbour and by bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been to Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrja, Saturday’s crash was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered by log residues, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible on the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
The guy happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had crossed the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama associated with the incident, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrja, catching the ship at the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions, and the cruises of the ship are expected to continue normally.
On Saturday morning, a diver checked the condition of the ship before the ship was towed off the shallows.
To be sure, we are still going to the yard to check that no damage was caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise booked for next weekend can be handled as agreed.
The cruise season continues until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services received an alarm on Saturday night, just after half past half past half past midnight.
Ambulances were alerted to the Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but ambulances were not used.
Late in the evening, fire chief Matti Willman said that the evacuation conditions in the lake were difficult due to the darkness and fairly strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on Sunday night after half past three that all the passengers on board had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruise ship has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s Judge Candidate Accused of Harassment and Drunkenness May Be Missing a Top Job
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a judge for the Supreme Court of the United States, may well be missing the post he is aiming for, says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up in office as someone else.
In the past, there has been a lot of controversy about the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court.
In this case, the judge-designate has usually withdrawn himself, Aaltola says.
The President has been able to keep his face.
Nomination to the Democratic Larry
The U.S. Supreme Court tries to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely fall to the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections, Aaltola said.
It would increase the voting enthusiasm among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
This is not the case for every presidential term, as the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life in the United States.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70-80 years of age.
Some Republicans are hesitant to call it
The U.S. Supreme Court judges will normally be subject to a background check, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has set a deadline of just one week for the FBI to investigate further, it may still bring up something essential, Aaltola said.
Yes, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for office will still be heatedly discussed before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are believed to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to a vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC she has identified the suspected Russian agent in the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on the photographs, the woman said it was Anatoli Tshepiga, a military intelligence officer working for the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously said they had uncovered one of the men suspected of being poisoned as Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities were covert identities.
A BBC group travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified the young Tshepigan from the photos published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Russian Hero Medal of Honor in 2014.
Russia denies the GRU connection.
The suspects said in an interview with Russian television in September that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Older people throwing bags in social security reform
Now we have a vivid example of what the change limit of the social security reform defined by the Government of Sipilä means in practice.
Vaala’s social services in my municipality of birth are provided by Oulukkaaren Municipality, whose Health Services Director was elected in 2016 by Attendo’s former Regional Director.
The board of directors warns the board of directors of change.
If social security spending rises now, the municipal government’s state aid will be cut in the future.
The decision-makers in the municipality’s centre were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to inpatient care in the health centre’s inpatient department and a small unit for people with memory disorders.
At Vaala, long distance home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages would be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be treated "at home".
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
The Left of Vaala did not swallow up poor preparation, but organized a good public event, to which many relatives, close caretakers and also delegates from other parties came.
I presented on the slides of the social security preparation how the elderly in Vaala municipality are already treated at home the most in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a member of the Neighbourhood Council, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again put the Oulukaari draftsmen on their backs.
Sote-preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen talk only about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or what staffing structure Attendo will use to care for the elderly until hospitalisation.
Without a nurse?
Because there is no doctor's night watch, the health centre's facilities are being closed down.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors of Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaala illustrates how central government officials rotate the delegates with inadequate information, and the delegates are stabbed with their backs against the wall with a change restraint.
This is how the Centre Party emptys the inhabitants of Vaala, because who stays in Vaala unsafe to live there voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was there a central election slogan that the whole country would be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the demonstrators, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to go to the streets in advance to protest the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
There were also supporters of Erdogan near the Great Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel pledged on Friday to rebuild relations that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who cannot go out on the streets of Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, Erdogan’s last stage of his trip to Germany, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three Accused of Murdering Journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them were released.
In February, Kuciak was found shot with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the killings were linked to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the printing fault, Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in magazine distribution in sparsely populated areas where distribution to shared boxes has to be done from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday’s newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The mail puts extra journal bouquets in the county.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be posted separately until Monday with stickers.
The distribution of these magazines is greatly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio announcing her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>151,000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight in 2014, which even claimed the death, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start later this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that her journey takes place about a year after her first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and we are in a weightless state for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also expresses his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Trip and saw it on Star Trek TV.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's where the idea came from...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a great host.
Manchester City continued its unsuccessful career in the Premier League after knocking down Brighton home in 2-0 on Saturday.
The sixth victory of the reigning championship season is guaranteed by the paint sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at the back of the Brighton goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton Defense into pieces in his 65th minute.
The Argentinian was able to place 2-0 on the penalty spot easily.
With six victories and one draw, City leads the Premier League with 19 points.
With less than one game, Liverpool is just one point away.
Liverpool faces Chelsea in their seventh round on Saturday night.

Lewis Hamilton praises Kimi Räikkönen and amazes Ferrari: "He's losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the Britishman was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen will not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he will move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would knock the gloves off the counter.
I don’t think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
"I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday in Russia.
Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes starts the race from the pole position at 2 p.m.
The evening magazine follows the moment of the race.
Soccer A-youth SM-series championship became a farce: the opponent arrived with just 7 players
The top league of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the round started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy had practically enough points against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship, must win PK-35 and wish the Lahti people to lose.
However, the Lahti championship was practically confirmed even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the game 16-0.
The latter led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-youth SM-series, i.e. the P20 series and the men’s C-section of the Two.
Vasa IFK has played against the fall of the entire season in the second round.
On Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in the away game and hope that Tampere United will lose its own away game against KuFu in Toivala in Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on a rooftop in Eno - according to the rescue department, luck was involved

Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, according to the rescue department.
Good luck, the statement said.
Rescue said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol was at the crash site.
Supo is waiting for new ways of inquiry: equipment purchases and recruitments have already been made, there is no whispering about planning operations abroad
According to Supo’s chief Antti Pelttar, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts, the budget of the Supo would be permanently increased by about ten million euros.
The offices of the protection police (supo) located on Helsinki Ratakatu are already fully preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Peltttari, head of Supo’s coalition, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams Sings in Topless and Campaigns for Breast Cancer Awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness about breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account where she sings only with her hands in front of her breasts, AFP news agency said.
It is the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I voiced The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to do regular self-checks," Williams wrote on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in a zone of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it saves many lives.
The Divinyls song was written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
It was the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the referee of the match, claiming, among other things, that men were accepted for much harsher behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain trail not suitable for height-hunts
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It is literally located on a cliff.
If you want, you can look at the forest below.
The rugged scenery at altitudes makes restaurant visitors breathe in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking among peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube commenters wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place tells.
This is the end of the race today: this is how it all ends.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela’s alley run, which has been quite popular.
The third season has gone on like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode as a premiere on TV.
The peak figures as such have no practical significance anymore, as there will be no follow-up to the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirkku takes another leap forward, and I think Jaska’s mother is the first to guess what’s coming.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, in the light of recent events it’s romantic, but then Laiho appears again.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
Yet no one can predict the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some amazing news.
The last will of the distance is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
In a week's time on Sunday evenings, Sorjonen continues for new seasons.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 21.05.
Should I go to work tomorrow with a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The cold season is hot.
A lot of people decide whether to stay home or not.
However, the worker should consider whether it is worthwhile to infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in a creep.
In the latter case, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted one day before the onset of symptoms and from then onwards from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough stops and the fever stops, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast return to the gym slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, put them in a handkerchief, and throw away the slag paper.
Still in pain?
If you have to leave home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You don’t have to put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited by the mask.
How, then, can infection be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Miss tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Ice hockey players and misses are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has been awarded the 2018 Miss Finland crown.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15 years old.
Alina’s mother is Ingrian Finnish and her father is Russian.
His father's Russian identity was bullied at school.
My mom and dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
I didn’t have any friends at Pertunmaa,” Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of Miss Finland.
After high school, Alina decided to start from scratch and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Miss Beauty made new friends and the everyday life started rolling as I wished.
When I was 15 years old, I thought I was an adult, but when I thought about it, I really wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is acquainted with the Pelicans.
After a career in the SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I could get into the winning trio and have a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live apart, our trust works well and the good thing about a remote relationship is that the initial spark stays on all the time, Alina grinned in May.
With steady growth, death behind us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s resilience.
Yet there is hardly anything we want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but even the theory of a moderate economy runs into major problems.
Over the course of a few generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living of which one could only dream.
However, the persistent overcapacity of the earth and climate change are threateningly shaking this stone foot of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed at Sitratori in Kannelmäki at 4 a.m. on Sunday night.
The man who was born in 1986 was seriously injured and the other, born in 1968, was less severe.
The older men have already been discharged from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incident.
The incidents are investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn: Inter coach regrets mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt’s handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match at 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt made it through from the right side and fortunately lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the guest draw, the Mariehamns reached the difference to the Turku Ball Club.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up by head coach of Mariehamn Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted that the team did not ignite the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately the Turku goal brought us more into the game.
John Allen, head coach of Inter, said the game was under control, but the goal was in pain again.
“One defensive mistake took our full score,” Allen said.
We were the best again!

The leaf showed its underpower, the place of play is not yet sure
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower game emerged when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last rehearsal match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Letterä baited Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, the leaf has been on display due to drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug group where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
He denied that he had committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who followed Flyers closely, estimated after the match that Letter belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will be in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck with underpower, pulled the defender against him and baited Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal.
The second time the two teams scored a goal at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th with a foreign match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, Defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the decision of the team's coaching manager whether he will join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of it.
The coaches will decide if I can play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.
He played against Philadelphia for 19:31 minutes.
In Boston, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and turned down 20 times.
Defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In the ranks of Calgary, Ilves was raised, defender Juuso Välimäki got a assist point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested among others Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Aleksander Barkov from Florida played for over 20 minutes and scored in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara bait his team's consolation goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the lost goal Joonas Korpisalo defeated 23/27 reels.
Already over 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a questionnaire about the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already attracted more than 180,000 responses.
The Otakantaa.fi service can still be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked if Finland should be at the same time as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
World's Strongest Man Lost Dozens of Pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall is crowned the world’s strongest man and is undergoing a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall was the world’s strongest man for a long time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed up to 200 kilos, according to Mirror.
The shirts were in size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not made to be this size, Hall said.
The Briton was trying to win the world's strongest man and the man with the family promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man contest in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram posing in a much thinner condition than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he now exercises aerobics five times a week.
The programme includes, for example, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelander Haf<0xC3><0xBE>ór Júlíus Björnsson from the Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner was Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on a rock in Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly caught by a rock hole"
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Pyhäjärvi, Akaa.
The emergency services received an alarm on Friday after 11:30 p.m.
The 30-metre-long ship M/S Tampere has been hit by a rock, and is firmly attached to its bow on a rocky cliff,” said on-call firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, said on-call chief Jari Nieminen to STT after one o’clock in the morning.
Ambulances were alerted to the Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that had sailed from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
On-call firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions in the lake are difficult due to the darkness and fairly strong winds.
Rescue said the ship's fate was unclear.
Apparently the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant-based inland waterway vessel with a maximum passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruise ship was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius’ evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on the petition submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LL Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged over EUR 80,000 in unpaid manager fees, including interest on late payments.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila tells Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius’s current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti, informing the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the sum claimed.
According to their response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
Literally, it was agreed that Helenius was only obliged to pay a percentage of his games.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and it would also have been unreasonable in Helenius’s situation, Sundman explains in a message he prepared.
There was never a written agreement.
According to his response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not once deal with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was assigned an “unidentified but significant” invoice for the manager’s work.
This year, the same allegations have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen’s and Kokkila’s subsequent activities cowardly, the reply states.
Helenius today faces Erkan Teper, who is seventh on the IBF heavyweight challenger list in Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-distance radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The announcement was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The announcement states that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He had already said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio regards Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert, who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a loved one with quick hookers and funny things.
I got to know Erk as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started as a warehouseman.
We met with Erik.
He was the spokesman for Finnlevy at the time and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I started making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the parties, making stories about the artists.
He was always expert and I saw how much fire he had in entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a kind man and a good reporter.
For many, he became acquainted with Yle as a respected radio presenter, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erik interviewed me several times.
He was a good speaker, he praised me.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist, but also with Fazer label Toivo Käärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
His greatest passion, however, was radio work, where he had a distinctive style.
He worked on radio since the 1960s and became acquainted with many listeners on Yle’s ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The association describes its economic situation as having undergone a "complete reversal", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible by adopting adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has become an integral part of our organisation,” Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been successful in partnering and, in addition, the return on the World Cup was maximum in the past competition season.
However, we must continue to be rigorous in the management of costs and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of corpses are lying in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outside for aftershocks.
One of those in the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Palu who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the Army Hospital in Palu was Dwi Haris, who was injured in the back and arm.
When the quake started, he was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I must have been squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to him and my daughter.
“I hope they are safe,” Haris told AP news agency.
Small shops are being robbed.
At the evacuation centre, 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, the mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the residents of Pau have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow upright, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury its inhabitants.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in Kahula escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
Prisoners were furious and set fire to the prison after the guards told them not to go looking for their relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
One of the first to land on the ground was an army C-130 carrier carrying aid supplies.
Please note that commercial flights to the airport are only allowed on a limited basis.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without the assistance of air traffic control, as the control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rainfall area from the direction of the west will spread across the country on Sunday night, the Finnish Meteorological Institute reports.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in Central and Northern Lapland there is expected to be slump or snow.
The frosts of the previous night will not recur, as the temperatures under the cloud cover will remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control.
Just to the west you can visit the side of the frost for a moment, said on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will turn eastward during the morning.
In the south and west there are swamps or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, the temperatures move all the way to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week will look similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in the sea areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected in the coming days, but otherwise there will be typical autumnal weather.
Autumn is starting to get really hard on you, Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final will not be on TV.
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and glamour of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
On IL-TV, Iltalehti’s entertainment editors are broadcasting live from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs ironworks.
The broadcast starts around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in Billnäs in Raasepori.
Before the finale begins, you can watch the atmosphere on IL-TV live.
The live broadcast starts around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, many Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They will be represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, a well-being entrepreneur, Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, Managing Director of Jounin Kauppi, and Katja Lintunen, a news producer at Seven.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the Missis.
A Russian father Dimitri and an Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments with the crown on her head.
They drove back to their home after the finals.
What a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival I got nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to get to university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to take a bachelor’s degree before the Miss Championships.
We asked him last year why he wasn’t there, but he wanted to finish it.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for both young people and adults.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the show, you can see that.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays ice hockey in Japan for his job, and he couldn’t get to Finland to encourage his lover in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a miss year.
Yes, that's the plan!
The parents hoped that their daughter would be there soon.
It's been such a long break in visits because of the Mississippi.
I miss you, even though you have posted messages.
A young man died in a car accident in Lahti after police arrested three people.
Police said three people were arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of the events or the possible intentionality of the overrun, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Nor did the police comment on whether the detainees and the man who died in the crash knew each other beforehand.
More information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband once said that he suggested it as a person for my story, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she worked as an EU translator in Brussels for economic and legal affairs until 10 years ago, after her fourth child, the family became a returnee.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I wondered what I would do when even the smallest child started to grow up.
Then, in 2014, a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo tells us that he had never dreamed of comics, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
The last time I had drawn was when I was a child, but when these manuscripts of Organic Hollow started to emerge, the situation changed.
Initially, I put a dozen scripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled painter, but I couldn't get her to join me until summer 2016, when I donated Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm took about a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who tells me that the board was a great encouragement for him.
The board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Piippo tells me about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
I keep thinking about scripts, but usually I don't make them all at once.
One three-frame strip takes up to several hours.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest art.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams’ Dilbert from contemporary comics in the newspapers.
The characters of the organic mummy are L-theme-freaky mother with a salad hair.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Gemini.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a compulsion bump, even though Organic bumps sometimes interfere.
Piippo tells us that she reads her series with her husband and children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’re drawing and say that’s what I’ve done today.
There are plenty of challenges for a housewife.
The series can be read online at organichomppa.com
The lottery’s million-dollar jackpot was swollen – these were the real numbers
There were no full matches in the round 39/2018.
The biggest wins of the evening were seen at Saturday-Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week there will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 million in the Lotto pot.
Saturday-Joker got two 6-correct results.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 win will be awarded to the winner who played with the Veikkaus card at S-Market Tikkurila in Vantaa.
The other was captured by a vassa online player.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself and did not leave a cracked tower until hundreds of passengers were safe
Indonesia's 21-year-old air traffic controller, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, has become the hero of the earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was in charge of air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Põhja after an earthquake struck on Friday.
While others were escaping from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane off the runway.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung attempted to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a spokesman for the Air Administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight was released into the air, and it was finally measured at a magnitude of 7.5.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn wondered about Europe’s end to the trade war: “We need to watch the next tweet”
The U.S.-China trade war is reflected in the entire world economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been lowered and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first morning that although the increasing tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is well-versed so far.
It has been able to establish a truce with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In his view, Europe does not appear to be crushed by a trade war.
You have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, he said, however, in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro area, and one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted heavily to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year’s deficit will be more than 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rehn expressed concern about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loan stock is problematic credit and more than ten per cent is unresolved credit.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country once again seems to exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be a good idea to paint yet another crisis, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would bring Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another problem facing Europe is Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
A disputed difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn became Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Mr Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have glimpsed in the speeches.
It probably doesn’t matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on the matter any further.

During the evening, reporters and photographers on stage will tell a long-prepared true story, which has not been previously published on any HS medium.
There’s something else that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a telling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the showroom.
The Black Box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as the journalistic act of the year.
The award-winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring season 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The show at that time will have a different content than this autumn evening.
Disappeared Mushroom Trial Found Thanks to 'Unprejudiced Experiment'
Finnish police’s drone know-how is top in the world: “We are being asked for training”
According to the Rector of the Police College, the police can use a drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find the missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Police College of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that “with unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are also at the forefront of the world here.”
The drone is quite new and even more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly widespread
Himberg reminds us that finding the missing person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
In the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are expected to be trained further.
Even now, drones are being used extensively in police operations, and their use will become more and more widespread in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence missions.
For example, we already have to go a little further to check out an area where there may be fears of violence.
The drone can then be used for preliminary inquiry.
Karelian Rugby in the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated a 2-division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuers were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second season they found a plot and porch the southern guests 26-12.
The 2-division championship was a historic rise for Karelian Rugby to the 1st division.
The club has previously played in the first division, but at that time Finnish rugby was divided into two levels, SM-league and multi-group 1 division.
The club intends to take the league seat, but it will have a lot of work to do next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game journeys, so fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
The head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, confirmed on the club’s Twitter account that the Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a superpromise in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training force in the late summer and has played strong grips in September’s training games.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts next Thursday night at Finnish time.
Montreal faces the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, told HS in an interview about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also spoken of the managers’ inability to act as a team; fear and unspeakability, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s risk-taking capacity and agility during the upswing phase disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum was also organised in Helsinki during the week, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, there were 12 business stars.
Speaking of good leadership was enough.
As Gary Hamel once said, “A good leader must be brave enough to take the company to the future, even when the company is doing well.”
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of stores known for its wide range of organic products, said that a manager must be able to communicate the purpose of the company to the entire staff.
This is not just about making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the book of introverts, said that the most successful leaders are found to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must match the life cycle phase of a company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A grown-up company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum was attended by 7,500 visitors, mostly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
This is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in a friendly manner.
However, they are not sure if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by the outsider.
Sara Chafak arrives fabulously on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the finals in a gorgeous black dress.
The Miss Finland 2012 spectacular dress also had a lace strap.
A little poten jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for auditions.
He has, among other things, made advertising photographs.
His work in the United States he describes as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, the work has to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for the model’s work.
“You have to push harder and be aggressive,” Chafak said.

The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police found a Volvo searched for during the operation: "We can't tell where"
The large-scale search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the <0xC3><0x96>resund and the Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Sjänland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
Is caught up with the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The car we're looking for has been found.
“We can’t tell you where the car was found,” Henrik Storm, a Copenhagen police officer, told Evening Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
He said the greatest danger is over.
Denmark's Ekstra Bladet reported on Saturday's police briefing.
Inspector General J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was in charge of the operation.
He didn’t want to tell me what crime was being investigated.
Skov said it was a “serious crime.”
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police do not say if they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry services have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has any reason to worry, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has been causing discord for decades - now the people are voting on it in controversial elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal to rename the country.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, it would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
So far, Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s efforts to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The vote started slowly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped that the agreement would be supported.
A referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a change, especially for young people, he said.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) was officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is interesting to know whether the turnout will exceed the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a victory in the 'yes' vote would give the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed for a constitutional amendment.
The agreement also needs to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m.
Pretty win!
Robert Helenius knocked down Erkan Teper
Late Saturday night, Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn competed against his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may have the opportunity to compete in tougher positions, which are of considerable economic importance, than they saw on Saturday.
Helenius settled the match in the eighth round, where he knocked Teper out with a hard left hand stroke.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
The "Nordic Nightmare" hit his opponent in the third round, when the German began to bleed from his nose.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the ring.
They had to fight in December 2015.
Teper then appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it was revealed that the German had been burned twice in a doping test.
Helenius has played 28 games in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional games in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton wins with a team order - difference I've already scored 50 points

There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position for the race, drove second.
Bottas, who won his career in Sochi last year, held the top position near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
The Red Bull Max Verstappen was fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu and were caught a block away.

Canada is struggling against time to reach agreement on Nafta with the US
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the two countries have had intensive discussions throughout the weekend.
Canada’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want the deal to come into effect before the Mexican presidential election winner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the treaty at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday so that the US Congress has sufficient time to evaluate it.
Neighbor thought the candles were a fire in Kaakkuri - fire department was alerted
Burned candles in an apartment building in Oulu Kaakkuri triggered a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen emergency services units were alerted due to a possible fire in an apartment building.
It was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building looked like a fire in the house across the street, which was why the emergency services had been notified.
There was no fire at the target.
Police captured 11 people after Honka-HJK match - riots on the field and at a subway station
Police arrested eleven people after the men’s football league Honka-HJK game played in Espoo on Saturday, police inspector Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The basis for detention was protection against crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
He was previously told by Night-Sanomat.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the pitch from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to thrust and fistfights between supporters of the teams.
For example, riding police were needed to end the situation.
In addition to the field, there was also a turmoil in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I was not there, but from the pictures I saw, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the riots that took place on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Tablekivi thrilled butterfly in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims in the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tahvili have progressed to the finals on the closing day of the 3/7 World Swimming Cup in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS’s Table Kivi beat Finland’s record in the 50-metre butterfly shoot, where he was second in the first round at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Kivi swims in Helsinki at 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, who represents Cetu from Espoo, was the 24th butterfly swimmer at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen finished sixth in the first round of the 50 m breaststroke 30,48 and reached the final.
In the first round of the two-hundred-metre medley, Laukkanen was 15th in the time 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - the reduced Orestia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the last time the National Theatre saw an ancient tragedy, Sophocles Philoctetes, was in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only intact trilogy of ancient plays, Aeschylus Oresteia, on a tour starting at the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! projects, which started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
The Atonement of Roiha from Orestea summarises the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the establishment of the rule of law for a meritable hour to twenty minutes, especially by compressing the choir sections.
The work manages to be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuri’s fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and theatrical sides of the theatre space highlight a simplified and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the choir and the performers who take their names off the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple interpretations of the name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, who are returning from the Trojan War, will be shown on stage, contrary to the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, it does not show that it is faithful to the ancient tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of actor students in the master’s stage as a close group, actually as a single organism.
Particularly in choir sections, actors who are very expressive, sculptural group formations can reach their rights on the stage bare, decorated only with a white curtain.
That's impressive.
The Oresteia tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer produces its first hydrogen loader
The new technology is starting to emerge in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement announced at the IAA in Hannover, Hyundai will supply a new model of 1,000 car batches to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues to build hydrogen cars on the road of the Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we take fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for ways to expand the market for these vehicles, for example, by monitoring the development of the refuelling network,” said In Cheol Lee, Hyundai Motor’s Vice President, at the announcement.
Fists whistled several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in a restaurant in downtown Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and as a result, he was removed from the restaurant.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the assailant hit him as well.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked the other policeman in the foot.
He also threatened the police with assault and murder.
He was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated in three cases of assault and violent opposition by the official.
There was also another case of assault in Kajaani city centre on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
Shortly thereafter, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim again.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and police were called.
The perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani Police Department by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investiga.kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long-distance radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, well-known as Yle’s long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he posted on his Facebook page in March 2018.
I'm sure we're done here.
The doctor said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of aunts and uncles must be guaranteed.
I first got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you’re surprised by a story on these annual tires, it’s usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a work environment expert at the Service Industry Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers are of course claiming otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious become known to the police, and many real cases of violence are not reported.
“Businesses are, of course, obliged to compile statistics on their near misses according to the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries are not included in the statistics.
The problem with violence is that it does not always cause physical injury.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a situation of threatening violence is difficult to distinguish when a certain level of aggressive intimidation has to be counted as violence – even if there is no attack.
Too many people are afraid in their workplaces, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has gotten guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were unlocked, the media also saw a considerable impact on sellers’ safety.
"At the time, quite a few employers arranged guard services at least for night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, we come to the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this creates a new negative trend.
When security kept the disturbances well under control, the impression arose that guarding would be unnecessary.
Nowadays, many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate costly security services.
Slight assault is a victim offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But according to the same sub-paragraph of the 2011 law, mild assault becomes the responsibility of the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents.
The next time the aunt or uncle of the store is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
If the court were to put a few assaulters in jail, and the sentence from that high end of the punishment scale, the manners would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost night and day even in small localities must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up to Miss before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Missi’s coronation will not be seen on TV this year in the traditional way, but will be shown on Viafree.
The show will be hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet will be hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and the media about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a cheerful applause.
Now all the ladies scream!
Now look at this male presenter of ours, Sohlberg glowed his colleagues as the audience cheered.
Many of the previous years have been followed by Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg glanced at Saro.
Sohlberg probably referred with his throw to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
She spoke about her divorce for the first time in the Evening Sanomat newspaper.
Missikounta said she does not want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public, as it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said that he is not in a hurry to start a new relationship, but that he is going to focus on himself.
I’m focusing on my own stuff and especially starting to live my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula’s marital status emerged even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio laughed at me.
Iro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi made a mistake.
A Nordic man tortured his bound cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The Ostrobothnia District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes committed against his cohabiting partner.
The instrument used for the crime was a belt, cable, and ties.
The court declared the objects forfeited to the State.
He was charged with aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
The Kokkola resident was charged with four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two misdemeanors.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the day, he was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday, the Ostrobothnia District Court passed its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to be kept in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated detentions and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these accusations were dismissed by the court as unfounded.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge gave a public account of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, baited a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on him.
In his verdict, the court ordered the confiscation of the state's criminal equipment: belt and cable, ties, belt of a bathrobe, a knife and a mower.
The Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together.
It is clear from the sentence that a large part of the most aggravated acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
There were four witnesses, two women and two men.
A 34-year-old victim must be compensated for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm for a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,800.
He is unlikely to have that money, as the convicted person has long been in debt.
The prison sentence is not the first for a man.
Italtapah does not disclose the name of the convicted person in order to protect the victim’s privacy.
A recent court ruling is not legally binding when writing this.
Europe leads four-point Ryder Cup
European golf professionals captured their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup around Paris by 10-6 points, while the 12 doubles are still ahead of Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's doubles the wins were tied 2-2.
Europe's lead stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four paired games on Friday and Saturday.
No European couple had ever done this before.
On Sunday, the two are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three Americans have won one: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK denounces harassment of supporters in Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The soccer betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning its supporters’ disruptive behaviour at Saturday’s FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the pitch and some seemed to be trying to challenge Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The police were not able to calm the situation, and police and cavalry were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the players and officers of the team are shocked by what has happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly reject any activity that endangers the safety of the matches," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers in identifying security threats and eliminating minor phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, joyful and supportive activities at football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He is now one of the growing numbers in the world who swears to have invented a flying car – or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has drivers like Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola does not believe in mass production.
According to reports from around the world, a man has spent much of his wealth building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he was flying with his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will arouse positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL foresees: tomorrow’s industrial action will be visible in children’s day care and social and health care services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime work and shift shifts that will start tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services and day care for children, says JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The impacts will be widespread and will certainly be reflected in the absence of sufficient staff on the spot.
Everyone has to think about how to find their child.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services play and that no one’s life is in danger,” Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from working overtime and shifting due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be hired, but for employees to work overtime or shifts.
This is not yet a collective struggle.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government’s plans to ease redundancy protection for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, the Labour Market Director of municipal employers, does not take any preliminary assessment of the effects of overtime and shift-shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very disruptive, even though the services may be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health care and technical sector that it is hard to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences of similar activities lasting for three days, such as those of the Finnish Association of Caregivers Super and Tehy.
Their impact was relatively small.
JHL’s overtime and shift change ban applies to employees in municipalities, churches, the state and private social and health care sectors, among other things.
For example, childminders are excluded.
At this stage, nearly 100,000 JHL members are affected by the labour dispute.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may last a long time.
The Association is also prepared for other industrial action if the drafting of the Lay-off Act continues.
The government should now admit that we are running to the wall and hard.
He believes that both the trade union movement and the government must come to terms.
What’s special about this is that the hard ones are already in the chimney, even though the performance hasn’t been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance, the gestures of rays and seahorses are studied
The Great Coral Reef was premiered in Hamburg last spring and was performed for the second time in Finland last Saturday, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be constructed, which will refresh and summarize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is plenty of magic in theatre for children as well.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations about children’s ways of receiving information and making art.
Children’s ability to engage in exercises and games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat similar to a fairy-tale ballet, fitness circle and nature-themed information session, but it is finally tuned in different, non-human conditions around the visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with the exploration of the movements of corals, living organisms and fish on the coral reef.
Six different fitness circuits teach, among other things, ray and seahorse gestures.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour’s duration will be performed, where music, lights, shiny paints and costumes will help you get acquainted with the life of the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef features both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals they observe.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
Eyes and observations pointing in many directions make the presentation dense and full of life.
Whether it is a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at a landscape, or another organism looking at an organism, or a landscape - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn’t seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the boundary between thinking and acting, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
The presence of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
The destruction beyond human understanding should not be hardened, even though it might be difficult to see the significance of self-compassion in the face of the visions of destruction.
In other spaces, his works have been constructed in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for which it opens up space for wondering and playing.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people begin to smoke and drink as they get younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives for intoxicants and sex, because others say they do too.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the "boyfriend"'s house this weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I couldn’t possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that we shouldn’t touch drugs and that sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I constantly see younger girls on Instagram in their pictures with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos in the evenings.
It's harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad I didn’t have a smartphone in my childhood.
I was allowed to be a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what other people thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the head of state that the Airiston Helmi incident is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Defence Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation into Airiston Helme is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime.
The information on the anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (cok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to announce the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily regarded as financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else, Kanerva commented in Yle’s interview.
According to Yle, so far no evidence of a connection to national security has been found in the confiscated material, but the investigation is only beginning.
We do not yet know what we can expect, says one of the interviewees.
The extensive searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled a case in which arguments are discussed both for and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saves Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool's 100% start in the Premier League came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the team's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran for a 1-0 guest win.
Then Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate alone at his own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a nice league cup away from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard got up from the bench to settle the match with great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very first few minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first played ball in a small space with triangle player Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard jumping forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed the rear corner of the perfect left leg pull.
Pool's brass watchman Alisson was a little slow in his fight and he only got his fingertips into the ball.
Klopp must have felt that the loss was a slight injustice, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's direction from the finish line.
In the second season, Chelsea Veskar Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson zeroed in on Hazard.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the brass star’s butt was directed towards teammate David Luiz, who saved the lead of the hosts.
It didn’t last until the 89th minute, when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from the 25-metre.
Sturridge was playing at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible uphill bet to honor it.
Liverpool's 100% league start ended with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also tightly involved in the championship two points behind the top.
The clocks are deep.
I remember when, a few decades ago, a magazine asked various Finnish influencers what divided the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one I remembered: Nen-end.
Some have a n-n-end in their last name, and some don't.
You can have split lines anywhere, and there was one caterer.
In the EU, Finland has achieved that annual clock shifting is being abandoned.
A lot of people agree that changing the clock twice a year has been a fool’s job and has caused a lot of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be, at least in Finland, the easiest phase of the solution, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day you will end up: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the public to express their opinion on the Otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The debate is heated at the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a say.
Wintertime defenders use the effect of morning light on people’s well-being to justify their position, and summertime defenders use the effect of evening light on people’s desire for outdoor activities and therefore on their well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good reasons.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythms a person’s day and gives them freshness.
On the other hand, if you don’t suffer particularly from waking up in the dark, lighting increases people’s outdoor movements and provides better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been counted to its hour.
I’d rather take both, but badly, we can’t do anything about our location in the northern part of the world.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many people anyway.
Typical of a debate on the subject is that one’s own view is promoted and the other’s view is strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other side are hardly heard, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the subject, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is awfully easy to debate, because it does not require much dedication and a sense of mutu is enough to justify it.
Similar issues are usually the most controversial and equally fruitless.
It’s a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we’ll adjust to it.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels awkward.
Josba fought for a narrow foreign victory
Josba's first guest game in Divar was a full three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a cheerful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled the men in chains.
In time 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi conspired to win 6-5 goals.
Both teams played decisive minutes at the level.
Josban’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next one will be O2 Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th Anniversary Celebration in Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th Anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The bombing of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a day of celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The family fair starts today at 10 a.m. in the church of Eno.
Afterwards, we move to the parish house at the Karelian banquet table.
There is a lot to do all day, both indoors and outdoors.
For example, the church building can be visited with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a parish master for 37 years.
The birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
Already decommissioned, the parish hall, built in 1982, will open its doors today for the last time.
We are now in evasive spaces in the former municipal building, says Markku Koistinen, a kappalainen.
The church building was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk Resigns as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors - <0x24>40 Million Charged for Fraud
Tesla and Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, have signed a lawsuit with the U.S. Securities Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of being guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he had set up.
Musk will continue to be Tesla’s CEO.
Musk will be forced to resign as Chairman of Tesla’s Board of Directors for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk will also be subject to stricter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor Musk’s communications more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay <0x24>20 million (approximately <0x24>17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's finances are secure.
The tweet momentarily raised Tesla’s stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue Musk and the company.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge frightened investors, and Tesla’s stock fell sharply.
More than 800 dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to at least 832, the country's disaster agency said.
The number of deaths is expected to increase as the damage is still being investigated.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
An earthquake on Friday triggered a tsunami in the city of Sulawesi.
Immediately after the tsunami, a warning was issued, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to officials, almost all of the deaths are reported to have occurred, at least for the time being.
Rescue authorities are concerned, inter alia, about the Donggala area near the quake centre, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Ruined requests for help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the devastated area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work tirelessly, day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to still have 50-60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the Rescue Agency, said one person was exhumed alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, a popular hotel for business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the earthquake and tsunami area would urgently need heavy clearing equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Please help me, you in and out of here.
Family members of my friend are still missing, one of the authors appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptors in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
Disruptors were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
It was an application used in the British Conservative Party’s government congress.
For example, Brexit ministers Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have been harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the application’s lack of encryption, the public had access to the profiles of politicians that were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party’s Annual Meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using a politician’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The login to the profile was allowed to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Somebody managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture and title into an insulting one for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by a photo of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign in to other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages on the profile person’s name.
The meeting app made the phone number of every journalist, politician, and participant public, Foster said.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the app is now running safely.
The UK's ICO is backing up the data leak.
The application was created by Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland quiz has a huge crowd of Poles applauding every week
Attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience to The Wall Suomi.
The fast-growing US format The Wall landed on the Suomi-version last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, was filmed in the same studio in Poland where other international productions of the format are also made.
The shooting possibilities in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the format’s large 12-metre-high gaming wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the program’s studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was thought to be Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether the Poles who may be sitting in the studio understand anything about the game in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Domestic Programmes at Four, explains the issue to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience consists of close friends of the players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland and just Polish spectators.
The audience in Finland’s production is made up of international clappers, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
There are also such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences, who attend filming on different programmes, Sormunen backs up.
He reminds us that following a game is not so difficult in itself, even if you don’t understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls that fall off the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters in the studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on,” Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was treated in domestic production recently.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff participated in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the descriptions, Sormunen summarized.
Japan's typhoon hits main islands, authorities warn of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon trail, but officials say that major injuries have been avoided and there are no reports of fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and more than 300,000 households have lost electricity.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains have stopped in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half day Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be strong winds and rain.
Trains were cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to meteorologists, Trami will be tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of aces darkened even more
The beginning of the aces has been bad.
The sky turned almost black when the team lost to Vaasa Sport on Saturday with a score of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori players now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points in six rounds.
No player in the lower two chains has yet scored a goal.
The pressure is also constantly increasing.
Against the sport, the audience was already out of the hall when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to be concerned, because we played poorly.
Particularly the performance in the second set was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 for Ass, told us.
The sport, of course, tasted good.
The team had a game below on Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible in the making.
Maybe it was, but the ass didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to Bread Day continued to grow
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, wonders at the audience in the large auditorium.
Somehow I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Tractor Plough Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of visitors could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the corridors were blocked well before ten, sellers reported that the products had run out, news porridge was sold more than before, and Hyvärinen heard that there had been an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell later in the afternoon.
The five hours in the morning and in the afternoon could accommodate a lot of activities for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen expects the event to reach even further.
Salesmen also turn to Liper from a larger area each year.
This year, almost a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.
Pyrkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
There were 11 different types of bread in the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the martto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tired eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing.
We have gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting grows the more age years are behind.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face as they age, as their visual acuity decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
With age, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the properties of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interiors can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The designer at the moment can afford to choose.
Popularity is a japanese style that combines Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, metallic shades or ice cream colours, has risen to boom.
Authenticity is fascinating in the same way as in any other interior of the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
You don’t necessarily buy the latest trend lighting, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewellery and elegant classics keep up year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian striker after three games
KooKoo and attacker Brendan O'Donnell split up.
The Canadian forward played a total of three league matches in orange-black without score points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooh in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old played for KHL Kunlund Red Star and the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new club.
The gambler wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic is replaced with paper
Nowadays, Pelimies recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stone foot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a condition that allows it to be used,” says Ville Puurula of Oulu.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving to recycled materials in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an additional inconvenience.
It is not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimäinen’s operations, as in addition to new products, the store’s main product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Every fashion conscious purchase: One and the same shirt will work in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season as they do.
With their versatility, they create the foundation for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knitted polo collars made of natural material can not have a wrong acquisition.
The outfit can be combined with straight trousers, boring outfits and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a striking style around it.
The polo is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classic sophisticated styler.
This is how you create style.
Autumn trend look is made of gold-brown and wide-length velvet trousers, black polo knit and grey boots.
The classic polo cardigan, together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish square skirt and the burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring an edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy garments: jeans skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
Russian intelligence agencies have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name is derived from the Russian words diversonno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppe: sabotage and intelligence team.
The Soviet Security Service’s agents in the western world prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, according to Vasily Mitrohin (1922-2004), the archivist who fled the KGB to the west.
His information was published in the books of Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB procured uniforms and accessories for the DRGs for covert operations by the Bundeswehr, railways, hunters and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies containing mines, explosives, detonators, and communications in the field for sabotage groups.
In 1998, the KGB was discovered in Switzerland, and its anatomy exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the city last night.
Police arrested four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahte blew 1.57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m. he drove at the beginning of the Kajaanintie road with two passengers.
At four o’clock in the night, a car crashed into a ditch in the Kuorevaarantie in Polvijärvi, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
He didn't have any serious injuries at the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old outsider who was driving a passenger car blew an alcometer at 1.33 per mil.
The police suspect these male drivers of aggravated drunk driving and the Polvijärvi driver of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of <0xC3><0x96>llöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van blew 0.52 promille.
He's suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting observations of the stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to police, the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The crime was recorded on surveillance.
The suspects, wearing dark pants and a brown or beige coat, left immediately after being stabbed in a dark station wagon at Ratapihankatu in the direction of the bus station.
One of the suspects escaped by bicycle from Humalistonkatu towards the city centre.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after being hit by a bus.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. on Raumantie near Niittumaa.
The driver of the bus is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s trial period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (c.) has played an important role for the team in the start-ups, underpower play and the defensive role of the Fourth Floor.
Filip Riska, who played in the season in early autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in startups, underpower gaming and the defensive role of Field Four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold onto a player with such experience, Mika Toivola, sports director of HPK, said in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska increases when playing the decision games of the Hockey League.
Central striker Riska from Pietarsaari has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
In contrast, Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after a probationary period.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Twice a climber was left to die
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest is based on a man's own experience.
The movie was made based on that.
Everest is going to premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s directorial year 2015 is about a survival fight that has been handled extensively.
There have been films and documentaries about this tragedy before.
True events are also discussed in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world claimed the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who guided the Weathers.
Weathers's life could have been saved by eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, which meant that the conquest of the summit had to be skipped.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came up, he got lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such bad condition that they didn't believe he could survive.
Weathers was left to die.
But by a miracle, he got back on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was abandoned to his own fate.
Against all odds, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church of Eno
The 200-year-old church of Eno has been celebrated on the hill today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at Eno’s church hill at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at Eno’s parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Uno’s vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and give strength to the work,” says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire in the church of Eno has touched many people and was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary celebration of the church.
The church of Eno is now the elder of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the church of Kiihtelysvaara was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a worship service was held in Agitationsvaara, in which the church was silenced and remembered.
Photo and video: Medicans flash their power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A hurricane-type storm hit Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show floods all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river, instead of a street, suddenly appeared between the houses in the city of Kiato, in the region of Corinthia, due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been flooded.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medic brings heavy rains and even flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medical doctors only occur once or twice a year around the world, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya behind before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There are also refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to decent shelter.
The area around Athens, which has been destroyed by fires in the summer, will also be subject to the storm.
In Greece, a medic also raged last November.
You should not go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, be careful not to overtake branches or other bulk in the storm.
Such guidelines have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece via Aurinkomatkatu during the weekend.
The directions are needed, as even the hurricane Zorbas is predicted to hit Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
The bad weather is compounded by heavy rain.
According to the tour operators, all those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatka and Tui from Finland who have indicated their phone number have been warned of strong winds via SMS.
Yet in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a communications expert at Aurinkomatka, the resorts have avoided the worst by Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and taken off on a normal schedule.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Security ahead of us.
Antonia Schroderus, a support media officer, says that their flights have also flown on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he said early Saturday night.
The subsidies currently cover more than 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to hit Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had blinked in Rhodes and the temperature was 27 degrees Celsius, Aurinkomatkat Ikonen says.
Zorbas is expected to become Turkey’s next trouble, albeit somewhat relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns who flew to Antalya with Tui,” Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussi have identical evening dresses in the finals - this is how they reacted to the situation
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he bought a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me a gorgeous dress for tonight," Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening dress was also chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two of them also noticed similar outfits and reacted with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomin that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get dressed on the plane.
Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet host in the finals and talks to the stars arriving in the front row.
Hussi has recently moved to Jätkäsaari since he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was great, I only stayed in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvis's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - attracted the curious gaze of pensioners
The presenter and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen said she had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Suomi shoots on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final.
The rush has been enough even to the extent that Karvinen arrived to the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I did makeup and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the dress at home, the carnivore laughs.
Karvinen says she pulled out her makeup in the middle of the retirees.
His preparations also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least to others.
She flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as a Love Island Finnish host.
He said his experience has so far been overwhelming.
Karvinen says he went to greet the singles on the show on Friday.
It's kind of raw.
These are the real feelings of the people, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can fit in.
A few years ago, the overknee boots that became the hit boots of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
As the name implies, the boots above the knee repeat themselves in style from year to season.
Stunning boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
In fact, the overknee boots are suitable for any outfit.
Whether it’s a penis, lace, tulle or jersey, the boots have a simple leather or leatherette finish.
The long boots look great both in the party look and in everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are perfect for nice outfits.
They balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plush skirt and a delicate, fluffy knit.
A fresh but autumnally stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro look comes from a long copper-brown velvet jacket, overknee boots, impressive earrings and a staple bag.
Although they have a certain level of sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars to start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and will take passengers on board, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic in the area is scheduled to start next spring with a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot all-year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars will be fully automatic in combination with other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several sensors and assessing whether the roadway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the obstacle detected is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4.
Robotic cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
The robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The robotic car stops are identified by stop signs.
The safest way to get there is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
Mokoma's bassist fell off stage in the middle of a gig and was injured
On their Facebook page, the Mokoma band announces a surprising situation at the Pakkahuone gig in Tampere.
The Mokoma band’s gig in Tampere’s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage during the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
The wrist of Hämäläinen was broken.
The band will post on their Facebook page.
“We are in spirit!”
Yesterday at Pakkahuone, Santtu stumbled from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour will be done with deputy manning, it says on the pages.
Fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the photo update where bassist-Santtu lies with plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been waiting for me, I was pretty worried about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones fortunately heal over time.
Good luck and a quick recovery for Santu and a good continuation of the tour for the rest of the band plus the substitute!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave such a strong drama out of the end of the gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo.
The main focus was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting pass and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, the permits for possession of hunting weapons and the permissible number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in chickenbirding were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found during the inspection, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 times a day for unauthorized hunting.
The police also shot 133 drivers, two of whom are suspected of drunken driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, the police times.
In conclusion, hunters comply very well with the permissibility of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter noted that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue its hunting supervision in the autumn together with other enforcement authorities.
Mukkänen to visit Turkey to monitor selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees arriving in Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for the group of people coming to Finland than the quota is, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
He will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior Ilkka Salmi is also on the trip.
Talked about increasing the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached in the Government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the last time the project has fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
During this term of government, Mr Mukkänen’s visit will be the first to be made on the spot by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (COP) and Paula Risikko (COP), were able to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives 10,000 euros of EU support for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the faggots - you don't know if to cry or laugh anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill basically forbids keeping all animals as farm animals, pets or other business activities that are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees.
Therefore, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being a law, it probably means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger society’s security or good manners.
In principle, all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or a decree are now being prohibited.
The change means that nothing new can be tried and done in business, for example, until a law or decree adopting it has been passed.
The government’s performance in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we now start on the path that, in principle, everything that is not specifically permitted in Finland is forbidden, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that animal welfare law requires an update.
But a law in this direction is not part of democracy.
I am unfortunately not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder if it will accept such a procedure of 'anything that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully there will be a reasonable minister who will stop such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: Four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn’s trendy clothing comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Combine a snake-patterned skirt with a more restrained top, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep your outfit stylish.
This autumn you can see a lot of silk and especially the silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothes of the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt with a sophisticated feminine top or casually as a pair of knitwear.
You can play more boldly with a silk skirt and put on sneakers or autumn trendy cowboy boots.
It doesn’t matter if it’s gray, brown or multi-tone, all checkered skirts are now part of every woman’s must-have fall clothing.
Combine different colours with each other and play with the square top.
For example, the combination of a truss and a ball pattern is beautiful.
Asymmetrical hems are a breeze of summer lightness that you can take with you to autumn.
The asymmetrical hem is at the same time feminine and playful and fits well in everyday life as well as in festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, grieving sweetly in Jere's arms
In Karalahtie’s family photo, the focus is on a cute three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito daycare centre established in Kerava.
Exercise entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family increase in early July.
The couple’s first son, Jax, was two years old in May, while little Alexia is only three months old.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, where the whole Karalahti family was involved.
Nanna posted on Instagram a photo of the Spanish atmosphere, where the whole family of Karalahti is posing.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
The attention is drawn to the sweetly grieving baby Alexia, resting on Father Jere’s arms.
Thank you for this.
Thankful for kindness, forgiving, for people’s generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti next to the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and former hockey player Jere Karalahti, who came out of the fitness diary programme, recently went to a kindergarten business and opened an Aito kindergarten in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the daycare centre.
Turkey urges charging mobile phones in case of storm
The Zorba storm in Greece is expected to hit Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about a storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and make sure the internet is working so people can get up-to-date status updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People have been urged to stay home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture, for example, away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to experience heavy rain and winds are expected to blow at between 28 and 33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece in the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies arranging trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Passengers were advised to follow weather reports and local authorities’ instructions.
A while ago when I contacted, there was a strong wind and rain.
The people were calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in distress either.
The ships did not operate in several ports in Greece on Saturday, Amna news agency said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, STT was informed about travel agencies.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disturbances in air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather is being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen explains why Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen admitted that Mercedes’ worst competitor was too tough in the Russian GP qualifying.
There is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver said.
They were just faster than we were, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, they drove fourth and with teammate Sebastian Vettel Räikkönen, who was clearly out of Mercedes speed, said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same pace they did.
But I know no more than anyone else.
This is a constant speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
Räikkönen’s future team, Sauber, was a rare treat in time.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen in the next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also made it to the final qualifying session.
For Swedish drivers, the 10th starting point is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive at all, the end result was tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen in the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more proactive player in the ring, but he did not get the proper hits.
Clearly the farther Helenius controlled the match with his tough sets that found a good way.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The decision was finally made in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked Teper straight on the left.
The hit was so hard that the fighter in front of the home crowd didn’t even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius blew quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
He changed his language for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenus was happy right after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenus’ career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's come to mind.
This is not going to get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before meeting Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice-president is calling for a clear rise in the number of casualties.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the total number of casualties could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
The rescuers are looking for trapped people and also dead people in the worst affected areas of Sulawesi Island: the harbor town of Põlva and its neighbouring town of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Palu, but the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel in Palu called Roa Roa has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to carry out rescue and clearing operations.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant response and lengthy reflection caused a laughter break
Billnäsin Ruukki is currently electing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview, each finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question from the glass bowl on stage.
In particular, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, finalist No. 6’s hesitant response received sweet but benevolent laughter in the audience.
The question was sent to Anttikoski via Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the last book the finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I’ve read is...” Anttikoski said thinking.
The reflection pause caused a laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I have read is...
I have read books in school!
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I’ve read is the economics of someone,” Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the miss tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principles.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m. with the abdication of Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
Sike’s apple-pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples on your own, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people are already growing a pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don’t want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you invest the pear in the cake as well.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar until foamy and then add the corn flour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the corn starch and baking powder and add to the dough.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough on the pear slices and apple slices on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough on the apple slices.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Allow to cool in a stove and then overturn on a serving plate.
Cut the cake until well cooled.
The cake is brittle in structure and easily crumbles because the dough contains almond and corn flour that are gluten-free.
International Criminal Literature Event at Ruka in January
In January, Kuusamo’s Ruka will host for the first time an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers as well as jazz music.

In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers will be represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status Symbols Don't Attract Friends - Four Facts About Popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" with slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and the dissident-coolness that is somewhat opposite to it.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers, had many socially desirable traits: outwardly oriented, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and cared little about outsider reviews.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardcore is not cool in the long run: a high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a study published in 2014 in Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good-looking gangs, and sought popularity as young adults were at increased risk of drug addiction and crime.
In their relationships, they performed less well than their unobtrusive peers at the time.
High-status luk sushi cars, badges or watches don’t make a person cool – or at least not a genuinely attractive companion.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with people wearing a regular shirt than a branded shirt – despite the fact that most people chose to wear a branded shirt when they were getting acquainted.
If you are on holiday in Greece, beware!
There's a hurricane coming in - weather warning screaming red
During the weekend in southern Greece it can rain as much as in Finland on average in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas hits Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the Foreca weather service’s blog.
According to the report, the storm’s hardest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm, which hit Finland earlier this week, blew at its strongest at over 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can come in southern Greece.
That’s about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has flooded Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men drooling Love Island Suomi Ankku?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that Anku, the beauty of Love Island Suomi, who is drooled by several men, also appears as a craft aunt in strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make octopus from an old paper roll.
Anku also shows in her sympathetic style how to craft a hedgehog from pantyhose, on which the right spikes grow.
Now let's make Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a surprising way, Anku hints and introduces sawdust, tights and grass seeds, from which she makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Ankku’s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas trembled and burst with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more tens of minutes after his pole position in the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
The fine lap left Mercedes’ No. 1 star Lewis Hamilton behind and was certainly a mentally important criticism for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
It feels good, I’m still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured out.
I've only been to the pole once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so time has gone by pretty much.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip the Sochi track, so the start is especially important.
And of course Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he was going to win tomorrow or whether he was going to win the World Cup title with Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I’m trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pile, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we will fight for both championships.
Leading Lewis to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let’s see what happens, Bottas added.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas’ success, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff had a taste.
Lewis intended to defeat Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the seventh turn.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself in order to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline gushed out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
When asked whether Bottas and Hamilton would be allowed to drive fairly, Wolff answered bypassing.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee wins the Finnish Rally Championship
The Rally Car Championship ended rarely.
Never before have the two brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
This was done by Eerik and Henrik Peterinen from Tuusula, who won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes in the final rally in the surroundings of Turku and Salo.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee secured the best result of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish Championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Honda Civic racer Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku Grand Prix with a malt, because the starting points were clear: a place in the top group would guarantee a Finnish Championship title.
In the dark of Friday night, the two had to even out when some of the extra lights failed in another special test.
It was a pretty blind spot for the third one.
You can't be in a situation like this.
On Saturday we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges Turkey, France and the United States to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and the war against terrorists is “almost over,” he said.
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their home countries.
The seven-year war does not seem to end.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting on Syria is scheduled for October, with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey to attend.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, had an extraordinary number of people locked up in front of screens.
In the United States, a full-fledged nomination of a Supreme Court judge made at least 20 million people see their TVs on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several millions more followed the online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched live streams, and CNN said it had set its annual record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN’s number rises to over <0x24>10 million if you include YouTube and Facebook followers.
Also, Fox News Digital reached 8.0 million startups.
The digital start-ups are channel-specific, with TV viewers coming from research and data analytics company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final results on Monday, but they will be spectacular anyway.
Rarely reaches 20 million.
With more than 20 million viewers, the U.S. is usually accessed only by sporting matches and major entertainment Oscars and Grammys, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The U.S.’s most watched annual program, the NFL final game, is definitely a long way away.
This year, the Super Bowl brought about 103 million people to the screens on NBC.
According to Nielsen, Trump’s first speech to Congress last year was attended by nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million people took office.
A Top-Relevant Thing
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is extremely important in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge after Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, and Republicans managed to prevent Barack Obama from appointing a replacement.
The second seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was a so-called scale language whose voice could determine the position of the nine-member court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 she decided with her vote that same-sex couples were granted the right to marry in the entire federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the conservative supremacy of justice for decades.
Children have the right to be informed by their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
In the beginning, the situation of the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of their babies.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but the repairs have taken a surprisingly long time.
Now the correction is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than an overwhelming matter.
After that, the layman’s understanding is the pressing of a button: while the cable is now closed, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her details to his or her parents if he or she has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old can't even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of the fourth grader of primary school except by requesting it printed.
It is not so much about the rights of parents as it is about the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that the parents can be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be respected.
There may also be family situations in which minors cannot speak freely about everything.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply meaningful human right.
In the United States, the FBI has begun removing allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
The FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
The other woman was heard by the Senate Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not be made public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The detained fighter continued to bully even at the chambers.
Police said they had put the man in a police prison to “calm down.”
Police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The officials report a case that started when a good 30-year-old man rushed into a quarrel in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside a nutrition store.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by dropping him on the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man hit him too.
The triple assault led to the call of the police.
The patrol captured the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the foot.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police said they had sent the man to a police prison to “calm down.”
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Indonesian Sulawesi: “Clean water is the most urgent”
The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information for UNICEF Finland.
Rescue operations are led by local authorities, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capabilities, Haru says.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but the situation in the Donggala area a little further north is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance is difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter -- for starters, tents for example -- and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent.
Firstly, people can most often be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Water systems will be repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water will be transported to the first emergency, for example by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
UNICEF, among others, has already started raising funds to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk to End Tesla's Chairmanship: <0x24>20 Million Fine for Tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space rockets and electric cars, has agreed to avoid fraud charges with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quit as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors and agrees to a <0x24>20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids allegations of fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla from the stock market, which prompted the company’s stock price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla’s board for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new “independent member” to its board and include two “independent leaders” in its management team.
Tesla will also have to set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Musk will continue to be Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal <0x24>20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay a <0x24>20 million fine to the financial regulator.
Twitter has misled investors.
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire’s tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange for <0x24>420.
Tesla’s stock price rose by more than 10 percent in 24 hours after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's allegations had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim on funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday, the exchange rate fell by 14 percent when the SEC, a securities regulator, announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to reinforce the company’s course again.
The Last Judgment Is Not the Reason
The bells of the cathedral don’t naturally ring when the indicators don’t move.
It's a technical problem.
The clock in the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Wise men point at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: even when the church crypt is exorcized and the organs are shining on their own.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
The repairman has visited it, but some part is broken and a new part is waiting for it,” says suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned on the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the final judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells us that the church bells don't ring because of a fault.
