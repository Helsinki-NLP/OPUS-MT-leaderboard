Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the underworld of Estonia, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich was arrested in Spain by court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal group, aged between 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug crimes.
An alleged leader of a criminal organisation was arrested in Mijas, Malaga, Spain.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of whom, according to the data collected, is a leading figure in a criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggest that the criminal organisation had clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal organisation was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal proceeds,” commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude that the circle of suspects in this case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been involved in law enforcement activities, some of whom have been convicted of drug offences.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish colleagues has been an important part of the investigation.
“International cooperation has become common for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” Prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police, said the detentions were preceded by a nearly one-and-a-half-year investigation.
“In the first half of the week, long-term work became a reality and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain,” he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officials helped with the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian guards.
These detentions are yet another message to the criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far unambiguously indicates that the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes while at liberty, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
The man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
Immovable property, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to secure confiscation in this criminal case.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for Organised Crimes and led by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced her to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich of Kemerovo emerged from the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed the taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and final court rulings confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight prosecutors separated from the so-called Dikayev criminal coalition and confiscated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80,000 in criminal proceeds, or the judgment against nine persons for the creation in 2006 by Igor Aleynikov of a criminal coalition aimed at the illicit trafficking of contraband cigarettes and the commission of human trafficking crimes in Eastern Viru and Southern Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds seized there is approximately 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues on a daily basis, prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, joint actions are carried out in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The statement reads: “The NAACP travel note for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents to be extra vigilant and extremely cautious when moving around the state, given the suspicious racial events that have recently taken place across the state.”
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue travel warnings both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win lawsuits for discrimination, and by the fact that minorities are inequally targeted by state law enforcement.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received complaints so heavily."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances early this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Chief Prosecutor, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The note is meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be ready, whether it’s taking bail money or informing relatives that they’re crossing the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in the 16th place across the state in terms of the number of similar offenses.
A travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the State Department about other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
Chronic hepatitis B and C, however, can develop into liver cirrhosis, or wrinkle, and liver cancer.
Kuluo Kutsar, the epidemiology advisor at the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grayish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also derives from the popular name jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can pass without symptoms.
Various types of inflammation of the liver can be determined only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Hearing Kutsar highlights the various forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, stool from an infected person to hands and hands, food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and drug use.
Persons at risk of contracting hepatitis A include family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travellers who visit countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccinations can be used to prevent infection, especially for people who travel a lot and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving products), by having sex with a donor, with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a hepatitis disease mother to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected people, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, family members and carers of sick people, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B disease.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using condoms for infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted through contact with the blood of a sick person, drug injections, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated domestic objects, donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a hepatitis mother to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of infected people, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, family members and carers of sick people, health care workers and rescue workers exposed to blood and other body fluids, people living with HIV, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C infection.
The preventive measures for hepatitis C include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using a condom for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses are transmitted through contact with blood and other body fluids, syringes and needles contaminated with them, sexually, and rarely from infected mothers to fetuses.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus and people without immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread via faecal-oral routes through drinking water and food, including eating little heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes, and infected mother to fetus.
Travelers can become infected with hepatitis E in countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Fruits and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from using drugs.
In the final lap, the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, but the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final lap and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn’t think long, dragging her husband Tania and the children on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the 5,000 and 10,000 metres gold doubles for the fifth consecutive title race in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" dives far deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But more deeply into history.
The awesome amount of information could have been used, perhaps a harder cutting axe, a narrower topic would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to have more impact.
There are now two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold" by Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermaths in Austria.
The first third of the book leads amidst the bustling cultural life of Vienna, and when you get into the Austrian capital, you can easily imagine how life was around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Central Café turned their heads when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel more culturally like a gram.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city with incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the development of the story.
Or, perhaps, every paired brushstroke adds color to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dreams of traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the turn of the century, nearly one in ten residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not drawn to all the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "The Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that towards the end of life, this majestic lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna at the last minute.
At the time, Klimt’s order cost 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of the master's love affair with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work with Adele began, Klimt had been to the San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the shining mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting "Kiss" was born.
Art historians didn’t miss the resemblance of the two women.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
"To commemorate my friend Klimt, I think I owe him a debt to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewellery to his nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed at drawing.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that he was not admitted to the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the Marian Testament, had changed considerably by 1939 – finding works that were pleasing to the Nazi party in Vienna’s rich collections of Jewish art had become important.
Some of Adele’s homework, but not Klimt’s, was also included in Hitler’s personal art treasury.
Sixty years after the Nazi robbery of art, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers began.
If you see "Kiss" at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, you have to go to New York City's Neue Galerie to see Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady in Gold".
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don’t plan on going to see Klimt’s work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish themes after the book was closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for <0x24>135 million.
So not so much a portrait, but rather the fate of the family - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book greatly facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In pre-swimming, Gold was very close to his 200m backstroke personal record by swimming at 2.16.62.
The top mark comes from a 17-year-old girl from a week ago, when she reached 2.16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, according to Priit Aaviku’s Swimming Blog.
Gold finished 10th in the A-finals.
In the final, he completed the distance with a time of 2,15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Of Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15.13), Gold was separated by just over half a second.
Gold ranked third in Estonia’s all-time rankings, and his fresh personal top mark is Estonia’s fifth-ever result.
Young hope for the future is still starting in 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle, 200m and 400m complex swimming at the Canadian Adult Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won the 200m freestyle silver medal with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time this distance was swam by an Estonian was in 2008.
Faster than ever before, only Estonian record-winner Elina Partõka has swam this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian resident in Canada also won the bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and 56.66 mark of the new Estonian season.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than her, has been swimming only one hundredth faster than this distance.
He reached his personal top mark in a further 100 m backstroke, receiving a letter at 1.03.69 at the opening of the notification swim.
In the semi-longer distance, he reached seventh place when he swam in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
It’s time for the holidays, which means relaxing for U.S. President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacationed presidents so far, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Even though the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have spoken about the holiday for a week.
They accuse Trump of taking too many vacations.
Presidents spend their weekends in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump has not been the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was on vacation for only 21 days.
Trump quickly forgets things.
The days after he became president, Trump said on the 60-minute show that there would be no time for long vacations during his american career, as there was a lot to be done.
Three years ago, he also expressed his indignation at Barack Obama’s holiday.
The president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting journalists’ heads off.”
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to a golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time for reading or other favorite activities.
There must also be another reason for work leave.
The western wing of the White House will be replaced with an air-conditioning system, which means that all staff will have to leave.
The West Wing also houses the Ovaalkabinet and other presidential offices.
“I don’t think any of you would want to be on the west wing in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioning,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you can get an idea from the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Do not apply for state office if you can’t stand the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to stigmatize him for everything from internal politics to his policies.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he did not keep his critics silent.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech may be deprived of us, and we may be led, in silence and silence, to slaughter like sheep.”
It brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor's officials stamped the lawsuit as null and void, and the online comments were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
He ranks second-best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkingly responsive noisy head.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite aptly as the main tool for communicating with his voters, for example, presenting his bald head cheerfully for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, blocking people visiting the Governor’s page, which is an officially labeled public forum, managed by staff who receive dollars from taxpayers, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online slanderous Internet trolls, spammers or hateful people.
The Post talked to a number of real people who Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people communicating with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, stressing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman, from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hatred, but genuine hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary on The Post news story.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone immediately indifferently calls it a collective effort, rather than admitting that there are a lot of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s officials called a “directed spam attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when workers had to be sent out to do the same, to gather up newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protesters and make them remain silent.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for denying Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant judgments on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria ruled that the chairman of the Loudoun County Oversight Board violated the First Amendment by blocking a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, affordable postage costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers overturned his way of managing.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, putting Washington’s decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected as part of an online letter collection project by George Washington, his office was buried under petitions that criticized his views on friendship, trade, and shipping treaties with the United Kingdom.
But he didn’t keep them quiet.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty relies on the comfort of home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European lead Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who led the last lap on the neighboring Archerfield Links tracks last year before surrendering to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will take on the role of tournament ambassador instead of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see the club shine in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
“Players see the track in its best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an ardent supporter of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This makes it possible to showcase the track perfectly.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the player at Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled a year after I won.
It's magical to come back to that place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year’s victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour at the start of the year when he turned 50, will also return to the competition.
It is his first event in Scotland after attending the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said Orr, a man from Helensburgh.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel the extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing golf again and have shown a fairly decent game.
I’m happy with the way things have gone so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Norr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in the Gold Land of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He seldom even uses the pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotali, the capital of the regent of Paniai in the revolting province of Papua, Indonesia, the housewife places a sweet potato, called nota, directly on the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed from the fire and eagerly injected into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a muddy floor without any furniture, and there he also does his daily household chores, such as washing his laundry with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The role of a toilet is played by a bucket in an unroofed room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous, however, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are also soldiers here.
“No one has the courage to visit after 5 p.m.,” he said.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupying forces.
The movement that prompted liberation from Dutch domination quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which still holds the region in its strong control, excluding foreign journalists and human rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both a remote and abandoned place. To get there, you have to fly from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire in 90 minutes, and then take a five-hour drive with a rental car to make you nauseous.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by corrugated iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different shades into yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have come here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago papayas worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and vivid skirt.
"Before that, we only wore leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 kilometers from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 people in New Jersey, lies the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of commercial timber stocks estimated at USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of suffering for the Papuans, as they result in the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study in The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately <0x24>20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 to one officer.
This golden geese is threatened and ruthlessly dealt with by the Papuans in their quest for greater autonomy.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, in the highlands of Papuan tribes, mass killings to the extent of genocide occurred in the 1970s.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Birsbane, entitled "We Lose Everything", contains testimony to atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because such incidents happen every week,” said Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono.
The screws have been tightened even harder, as Papua’s natural resources have caused an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia’s crowded islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family diners sell crispy chicken and mixed vegetables gado-gado, which is served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local papayas,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital for work.
"The indigenous Papuan mama-mama's [women] will lose their market share as a result."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
On his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter won 27 of the 29 electoral districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in anticipation that he would fulfill our hopes for restoring justice," You said.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was in a low position.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotal were singing Christmas songs by a fire when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so brutally beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even further.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They wore ceremonial hunting booths and performed a waita dance of the papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated the bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
In the wake of the escalation of resentment, the soldiers were sent an order through the internal radio: "If the crowd is more than three times resisting, shoot them," according to an official document seen in TIME magazine, but not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), an elder in the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, felt the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to return home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the porch of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of gunshots," he added.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes told TIME, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only returned to the security of their station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with death," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto announced that he would put in place an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violations of human rights committed.
Almost immediately an apology followed.
“Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes,” he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be judged by the law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the one in Paniai.
The families of Paniai’s victims accepted such claims with deep mistrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He said he was still scared years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid to autopsy the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring Paniai regiment in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a quarrel broke out between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office on the construction site.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the police officers, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," said Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being recorded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dan and damali tribes living in the greening highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the rebel army of the Free Papua Movement (VPL), which claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by organising random attacks and abductions among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of 'protecting national sovereignty', has in recent years arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as the "tragically forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their own food mainly from sweet potatoes, along with a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have worsened between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua itself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribe Council.
Separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they “did not follow appropriate practices” despite being granted rare filming licenses.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokow’s election promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Journalists trying to report in the most troubled provinces of Papua in the east and Western Papua in Indonesia are facing new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a journalistic look means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council urged the six Pacific states Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate “a variety of large-scale crimes” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL as well.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Democratic order and freedom of the press still exist in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations."
The local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people who attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous interrupted their silence, according to a source, urging: "We want freedom."
There will be a new presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," said Hobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to understand that, in addition to living under the threat of a predatory army, the Paniai people are suffering because of niggas’ education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuans, regard their vote given to Jokow as a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims survived the last symbolic uprising and buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallows Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from this 337-meter-high, 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that in just two years has ravaged a high-rise that happens to be called the Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
Civil protection officials in Dubai said firefighters extinguished the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
In an investigation carried out by the board of Torch after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most damaged were the facade coatings - decorative panels and insulation of the external surface.
British police say they believe the insulation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June, killing about 80 people.
These phones are likely to become the best sellers in the autumn.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech enthusiasts, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were launched in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to be available in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2’s marketing and sales director, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, a edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and a super-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales chart, has created a lot of excitement in the tech world.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models based on rumors, which are likely to conquer sales charts this year.
These four top smartphone models will hit the stores in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the stores by mid-September.
The rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what you can do with it spread a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn’t bring significant differences compared to the iPhone 6s, Apple’s tenth birthday is expected to make the new model completely different from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front of the phone, a home button is lost, and a fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple’s design manager, insists that the new iPhone model should look like smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There are many rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to have been designed even more for the business user, and the S Pen enables even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to the 23rd of August.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones with the Nokia 6 this year, their flagship, the Nokia 8, is still missing, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We expect Nokia to deliver a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia also has an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia model will have two rear cameras, the optics of which will be manufactured by Zeiss.
If Sony’s flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are looking forward to a smartphone that is a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
Sony has speculated that the screen is at least six inches long.
What the reality brings is that Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post unveiled transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly announcing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States cracked the wall with him over public condemnation, saying, “You must not tell the press.”
Trump set up his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing the intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement whereby the United States takes on refugees headed for Australia is “ridiculous”, “crazy” and “stupid”. He argued that an agreement made under the Obama administration would leave him with a “leadership” impression because he has proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees into the United States.
Trump ended his speech by announcing to Turnbull that it was “the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Lininid in a case where the City of Tartu rejected their offer for a bus line transport contract from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree by which OÜ MRP Linna Liinid rejected the offer of Tartu bus procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is a public bus transport contract within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the decision of the Tartu Circuit Court.
The Supreme Court did not deal with this.
While many people complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is filled with drunken partyers, there are also many who have nothing bad to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the party was so polite in the store!
I didn't see any vagueness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says Laine.
"It's nice to be here, to be there and to feel the joy of Pärnu, which is like a winter sleep in winter," he adds cheerfully.
Laine's sleep isn't disturbed by the dull sounds from the beach.
While living in the city centre, he still heard music being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
“I hope to hear you,” he said cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke to <0xC3><0x95>htulehti, also said that the big festival is a good thing for Pärnu – it helps the turnover of local merchants a lot.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
A party noise doesn't bother a woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And it’s good that people are moving, and it’s already happened three times,” she says.
The first time was a bit worse.
"Maybe there were complaints," he thought.
However, the noise on the beach is common for summer capitals, he said.
"This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town," says Harri, who is hosting in the park.
Noise and turmoil have not struck his rhythm of life either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
A loud music man is not crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can stick together and there’s no trouble,” he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite, he said.
“They’ve exaggerated a bit with bottles, of course, but young people are young, and God, let them go, but be human, and we’ll do it!” he said.
By this time, the coastal residents have travelled somewhere away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep is not disturbed by festival music either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, so we heard more.
We live outside of the city, so it actually sounds pretty good on the river Pärnu," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revitalize business
British education firm Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the threat of business tightness.
The job losses, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are likely to occur between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US<0x24>394 million) under the Third Cost Reduction Program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its shareholding in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said their expectations for the year had not changed since it announced a 1% increase in sales revenues to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber, according to officials, attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the city’s Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque attack in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-carried self-made explosive device".
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for the forces in Bagram, Qarabagh, NATO.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shia district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S.-led forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog order after the lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revoked the decision to delay the adoption of a Obama-era decree that obliges states to limit emissions of smog one day after 15 states sued the agency for this action.
The EPA announced its decision to resume “2015 ozone determination procedures” late on Wednesday, saying it shows the agency’s commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to have a dialogue with our state-based partners and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone ozone measurements to measure smog pollution in different parts of the country, in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year until October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standards.
The 15 mostly democratic states filed lawsuits with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, claiming that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. According to Trump, this is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost economic growth.
But these aspirations have provoked counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase the risk of respiratory diseases such as asthma.”
German pigs can have a party.
Pigs and cattle in Germany may come to a party as heavy rains threaten the harvests of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, the rains of weeks before the harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"Wheat quality is far worse than last year and worse than it was in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, which is double the normal rate, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by a rainstorm, which has continued in August.
Many have their eyes turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only 5% of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet started harvesting, according to local catch buyer Ceravis.
"It's a pretty tough day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, or the cunning snapshots of the Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairgrounds, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (living) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbours’ endeavor to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes comes to the fore.
The Finnish use of wood as a material for construction and finishing, as well as for the manufacture of furniture and beauty products deserves admiration and respect.
Both the builder and the (home) designer will find invigorating techniques and smart solutions in the exhibition houses.
There it is evident that the shades of black, white and gray, when complemented by timber tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the fair will last until August 13th.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night of today, the line was drawn to this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did his best to be remembered as the last performer on the main stage.
The crowd was really upset at the time of Garrix's performance - they sang, fluteed, danced in a self-forgettable way.
When Garrix finished, the crowd spread out from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer captured over the course of three days at Weekend.
Surely you are one of them, find out!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on the collision course to face up to the most enchanting boxing match of the near future in a weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN’s office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the weight chart.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belts against Miguel Maria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. at ESPN.
While the couple was posing for the photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I moved up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to go down to light weight.
And he has to move upwards to a light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans wanted it.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. This is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut in class at 61.2 kg towards the end of this year, in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokaut), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title on September 23rd.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, saying later that he would be open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a "strong fighter" and could go see her fight on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in Garcia's praise, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
They both said they felt the tension between them growing.
“It’s a fight that needs to be realized.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
Which corners of the world are moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family visits.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 aliens, then last year the number was 4,928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, but in recent years, this number is approaching 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014 1087 people received temporary residence permits, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year more than they left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that people are looking for work and learning opportunities in a country where the community and many families are already in front of them,” said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though the latter had the highest number of temporary residence permits issued in the last ten years.
While Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens come here for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Defence Academy.
“When we look at where Russian citizens who have obtained Estonian residence permits have moved to, there is Ida-Virumaa immediately after Harjumaa,” he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The reason for the leap is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to settle in Estonia," said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, according to whom the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have resided here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
A residence permit for long-term residents, for example, requires five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also been reduced due to the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer keeping a finger on whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became very popular last year - applicants were still grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54), and Nigerians (36).
Altogether, 1968 people received residence permits to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Within ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When Nigerians received three residence permits in 2007, last year they received 200.
They come from Nigeria to study in these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has increased mainly due to study migration.
The rule is that wherever a community has emerged, it is easier for others to come,” Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
When around 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, this is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we add the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at about a percentage," Maasing said.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people emigrated to Estonia last year, and 13,792 emigrated from here.
This means that immigration exceeded immigration for the second year.
Most of the immigrants and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was at a low level by 2,000 people last year.
Estonians primarily travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
For Maria Tammeoru, however, the bottomless idea box is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem alien to some, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of Haute Couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can make your life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and grey everyday life.
It was this reasoning that caused the plan to move high fashion in Estonia into rural areas, between forests and fields, to people whom fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where a royal defile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often take a pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you hand in hand.
Most of the audience just came to renew, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they will be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I’m on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, they didn’t seem to come to an end!
Maria also refuses to admit to the fashionable that the creation must be presented to the superslane supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they are always happy to come.
This is such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my show myself, because I’m always behind the stage to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to sit quietly in the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to perform a representative role, but to be in everything by hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my work and I'm not afraid of work.
It’s not just about design, it’s also about stylistics, logistics, organization, organization – everything has to fit into one temperamental woman’s day.
There are a lot of fanatics going on here.
I can’t tell you when my day will end, it’s just a day full of joy for me!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an unceasing chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and in turn, compliments.
I've been told many times that there's magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The generous tulle satsires that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp about U18 boys: the gun of the Estonians subgroup tournament has now been turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale is over.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn’t get to the table.
And if there’s such a big difference in the table, there’s nothing to do,” commented BC Kalev/Cramo Assistant Coach Martin Müürsepp about the 61:75 loss of Estonian U18 basketball boys to the UK.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack either, it hit.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up defenses.
In defense, however, they were able to hold their hands anywhere in between, we could not combine.
It knocked the team out of control.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to the Müürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to reduce the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his caregiver in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, so far there was a unified strike fist.
It is a pity that you have not met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played its part today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has been carrying quite a heavy load.
But he did some pretty nice moves that I’ve seen in training before,” the instructor added.
Women's basketball team scored less than 10 points by three quarters at the European Championship...
In the U18 age group, the Basketball Tournament of the B-Division of the European Championship for Young Men does not only take place in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And, unfortunately, Estonia’s game with Poland was in the area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter it was still 9:49, which means that it was only in the last ten minutes that the opponents took their foot off the accelerator, and that period was tied 16:16.
Both in the first and second quarter Estonia scored 4 points, in the third 1 point...
The Estonians hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 missed the game, then one in the three, and then another 21 missed...
In about half an hour, one of the 47 shots was caught.
In addition, there were 2 free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball calls at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day Portugal had to be recognized as 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent anti-mining team arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled visit to the port for the weekend to replenish the ship’s supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for the return to the sea, while giving crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days off.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future operations in the search for historic explosive devices.
“Estonians’ participation in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they are conducting in local waters illustrates our integration with the Allied forces,” said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, who is in charge of the Operations and Planning Division.
As of 29 June, the Latvian naval commander Gvido Laudups will lead NATO’s 1st permanent anti-mining group, who will take over the duties of group commander from Estonian naval officer Lt. Johan-Elias from Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian naval support ship LVNS Virsait, on which the group’s command staff also operates.
This half-year, the Estonian naval mine hunter Sakala will also be part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels under NATO’s naval command, NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Rescue Team is a preparedness unit that is part of the first rapid reaction group, which the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolero" to the entertaining "Karlsson", as well as a self-produced production, this time by Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "The Years".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It’s bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose charms take hold and never really let go again.
For the experience the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of Maestro Eri Klas look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my leadership career.
Perhaps this will make it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the team of Birgitta Festival and of course it all passes on to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the big heart of Eri Klas that also gave me the strength to thrive at the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer special?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren’s story will be presented.
That's "Karlsson flies."
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He has probably had a Karlsson character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have it piled up.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people as on myself, or how I meet each new day.
And this kind of conscious tone-keeping, keeping positive and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been practicing it especially hard and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don’t think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but they’re slowly discovering it.
Right now, it's a big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you walk into the conductor's remote?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a little moment for myself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before the big performance or take a little nap.
In fact, I even like to interact actively with people, even before I step into the conductor’s remote.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, there’s something to discover for a not so big fan of opera and ballet!

New results of tests to assess the age of Swedish asylum seekers have been published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were tested for their age with a novel medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes the results are accurate.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing early this year.
The tests were created to better estimate the age of asylum seekers after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensics Institute estimated that the test subject “may be 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person was "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to last month’s statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age-assessment method, which uses X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to find out if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I’ve had reason to think about it and I don’t think the measurement method used today should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
"If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, it can be said that the risk of a child being categorized inaccurately into an adult is low.
The highest risk, perhaps at about 10%, is when a person is slightly under 18.

The 20-year-old hammer hunter Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, taking a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female vassal hunter at MM, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear,” Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my discharge and I am very happy to have found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rain didn't bother Orel, because he trains through the winter at TUT stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little grin.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I understand, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up, that’s what it does!
When you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the debut of MM and that there are still many good competitions waiting for him: "I came here with the 32nd and final result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I’m 20 years old and that’s all that matters.
I’ll take a good experience with me and some days I’ll be competing for medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change parties with President Trump.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Justice said.
“Today I say to you, after many prayers and reflections...Today I say to you, West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
At the gathering there were shouts of joy.
"So I'll be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d say it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had promised a big announcement at a West Virginia gathering earlier.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states and that the coal business inherited him from his father.
Its value is approximately <0x24>1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement on Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from working for the better again than working for it.”
“Of the only 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is headed from start to finish and unable to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC president Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Not surprisingly, where there are so many people, there are so many injured.
Urmet, who was working in the medical tent at the weekend, told <0xC3><0x95>htuleht yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, twisting out and light falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and so the problems come.
The medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one fracture in the leg.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, the bigger ones we'll send to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the celebration doctors are also asking for a painkiller to treat a hangover.
Coe apologizes to Russians for doping scandal
International athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "honest apologies for Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the ban on competitions in his country is right and he has a firm intention to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who have been snatched the gold and silver medals in the competition.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"Today, I think it was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian sub-federation itself acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and are doing everything possible to restructure the sub-federation."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to get the situation back to normal.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet several of the criteria for restoration.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls are still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution significantly change everything from fuel to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win in one place and lose in another, smaller mining companies won’t be helped.
Today, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the era of electric cars.
This year, the governments of the UK, France and Norway have decided to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
That’s why Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars will be sold than oil-fuelled cars in the next two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, for which demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which Exane BNP Paribas estimates will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
Increasing demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from a growing trend in electric cars, from rising copper prices and from being the world’s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
The other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Cobalt prices on the London Metal Exchange have risen 70 percent this year.
The price increase last year was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s stock in London rose by 20 percent, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers, lead companies like Recycling and Campine will have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead are batteries that power the starters of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lead price movements have not yet seen the impact of a rolling trend.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal in London among the major industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the far future.
“I’m not sure it’s that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition,” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead drops, it happens slowly.
This may happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine start-ups, will increase, according to an international lead and zinc research organization.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as lighter cars can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand for aluminum mummy of 1.6 million tons between 2013 and 2016.
It accounts for 2.7% of the world’s total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen by 13 percent this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce ultra-light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to withstand aluminium mummy.
"Strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
Some progress has been made in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was spent on catalysts for diesel-powered cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
"Many currently in high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there will be continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore chief Marc Grynberg said that by 2025, more hybrid cars will be sold than full-electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos will develop hydrogen-cell-based cars that rely on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not proven itself commercially.
"Diesel seems to have a clear loser on its way to electric cars," said Brunet of Paribas, Exane BNP.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July after a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How Soccer Finance Rules Affect Neymar's Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record-breaking transition from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still awaiting.
UEFA’s 2011 Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to make that kind of money for recruiting Neymar and including him in its star-rich line-up, given that the team is funded by a Qatari energy-rich family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they need to balance this with legal sources of income that will allow them to get out of the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into high debt in search of success are actually engaged in cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners should give up subsidies.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on tracking clubs’ losses instead of debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and then make a big expense to improve the team and create a global brand – is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year FFP valuation period, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini being disgraced as president in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s over-purchase clause as a single full payment, it is possible for PSG to split this amount into instalments for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
With the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi's Manchester City, faced the heaviest penalties.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at the time <0x24>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to trick regulators by blowing up their incomes through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was bloated.
It has been said that a certain portion of Neymar’s PSG service may come from Qatar through payments from the World Cup 2022 organizing committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed Neymar's move with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity was guaranteed, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Recently published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship, sales and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to stop Neymar’s transition, arguing that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the club is financed by the state.
"This is a consequence of ownership rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
“When a club is owned by the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or interests in having such a big player represent the country."

Soon, however, one of the planes will be decorated with a portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today, 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that torn roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which ravaged Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage.
During those days, the wind speed in north-western Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was dark and dark, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in an interview given to the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.
Linda’s husband saw the garden he had planted collapse.
But what do you do with your hands on the trees, where can you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed through the windows,” said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
That the roads were full of trees and that the railway station’s platform roof had flown 20 to 30 meters away, Linda, like most people in Haapsalu, did not see until the next morning.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa, the trees were rolling down, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with rags and rags like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly in the storm of August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage there was also great, Virumaa Gazette wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped from the ground, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured at up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of 6 August in Tallinn, a little girl called out, "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can’t get down!” wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to be demolished later.
The constructions of Türi ski jumping hill, which were not restored afterwards, could not withstand the Augustine storm.
On August 12, 1967, the newspaper Red Star reported that the harvesting of fallen trees and their branches in cities and settlements is progressing slowly, and residents could be involved in the harvest work.
Grain fields were also heavily damaged by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "participative organizations must be the instigators and guides in both reorganization and harvesting."
Hurricanes occur when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for thunderstorm wind in Estonia is from November 2, 1969, when the wind speed in Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the meter broke, so the speed of the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
"When there is no weather, there are people on the beach, and when there are no people, there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
Gulls are screaming on the beach of North Tallinn Stroomi.
The melodic competition for them is a low-speed tractor that plows stripes off the plaid.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimeters, picking up sea debris and human waste: bottle caps, cigarette butts, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and when they are not, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, Head of Beach Cleaning at Haabersti Administration, a private limited company.
It's 6:30 a.m. and there's a bit of cleaning on the beach, because at 8:00 the place has to be in order for people.
Usav's at work already at 4:00.
Besides Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beaches.
The amount of garbage has decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usav, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before, when something new was set up, it was already broken the next day.
Now we have what’s on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest projects in Estonia’s beaches is the cleaning of sea debris that has been washed ashore.
For example, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tons will have to be transported during the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second major category is household waste, or all that people leave behind.
The one and a half-kilometre coastal strip at Stroom has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much rubbish.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is one-fifth less than otherwise.
The third type consists of abandoned objects.
It's mostly children's games.
This time, Usav has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will be waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Normally, more of them come out, but this is a normal prey." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
The garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a spokeswoman for Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disturbing to the locals.
Noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
In the daytime, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, the goal is to get, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, Stroomi Beach under the International Blue Flag Quality Label.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We've got more acres and stones and harder to sift the sand.
There is less rubbish on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, hears about rubbish on the beach, he involuntarily enters into a conversation with a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
In the morning, there are pictures everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags upside down,” says Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the trash cans and put lids on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from hiking there.
Overall, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroomi Beach.
You can see that the city takes care of it.
With children's playgrounds, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, roller skates could only be driven on one road,” notes Martin.
Treasure Hunt Finds in Stroom: Coins, Only Coins
This morning’s low tide has been taken advantage of by 40-year-old Dimitri, who as a treasure hunter combs the beach with a metal detector.
He doesn’t think he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been working on it for a year and I haven’t found anything of value so far,” Dmitri says.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throw into the trash.
Usually there are coins.
"Gold, rings, and the like usually don't exist," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and a reduction in inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as tight household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rate at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for a rise this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the upturn.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 growth forecast to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes will continue as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the increase in rates will be necessary to curb inflation caused by Brexit in the next few years, and that higher than expected increases in credit costs may be needed in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will close the fixed-term funding scheme, which offers banks cheap funding, although it said that it now expects a <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more offer under this scheme, i.e. <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "The MPC's average estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real income will continue to affect consumption."
Regarding the rates, it was reiterated that the mitigation of inflation requires "a slight tightening of monetary policy" on a "somewhat larger" scale than expected by the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second one in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth projections for this year and next are comparable to the May projections of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018 remained unchanged.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any adjustments is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have dampened the growing hopes for growth in the second quarter, as GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to gain some momentum at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report by the Bank gave little reason to cheer households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before improving.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a blow to incomes in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weakness of the pound, the economy is also stimulated by increasing demand for British production, which partly compensates for the lower costs incurred by consumers.
The decision comes a year after the rates were shifted to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused a sudden decline in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on struggling households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared with 2.9% in June, although according to the Bank it was expected that it would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco’s head of mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: “Given the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again, as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed, as refinancing, often at a fee-free and low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS to prescribe 10,000 HIV-controversial drugs
Patients will have access to “transformative” HIV-prevention treatment since September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
The NHS England reported that the National Health Service will now make available an estimated 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets to be administered before intercourse during the initial three-year clinical trial, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection of high-risk people by about 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Court of Appeals supported a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency’s own claims that the drug should be financed by local governments instead.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed the move as a “new large-scale intervention,” while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as “a turning point.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. More clinics will be added in October before the program is deployed everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain drugs in the human body that prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken every day or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after an international tender.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said, "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in over three decades of fighting one of humanity’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those in need and at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, high-risk people in England have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial, which is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiation with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now it’s a priority to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is put into effect quickly and that none of the people at risk for HIV are left out.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the clinical trial for PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and dragging the government’s legs.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can change the prevention of HIV and stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important for the clinical trial to be deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.”
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while they fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity on the next day’s exchange between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of Nord Pool was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the hours in the previous month flowed towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not take place on the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity travelled 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours had the full transmission capacity in use.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July, the exchange price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX market may be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity went up last month and transactions took place at a price of EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
High-rise living - half-floor and smart design tips have made this small Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, swapped her big Knightsbridge home for an apartment at Earls Court in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner at Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface," Joanne said.
“I’m looking for something that’s equal to the price I’m offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first it was a one-bedroom apartment with a sophisticated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architecture and design studio based in Notting Hill, Erfan Azadi, to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were located on top of each other without having to bow.
It wasn’t just a platform construction, we used a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower rooms was correct.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in a room on top of each other, with plenty of dramatic elements.
The half-floor opens from the old copper-lighted Retrouvius window overlooking the glamorous living space below.
The golden furniture with mirrored surfaces, silver details and the retro-chandelier Serge Mouille luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and lighting saturation.
Mirrors are added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides a storage space for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The possibility to close the kitchen area when not in use adds charm to the living room, creating the impression of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is that it is a garage type retractable door.
"There was some design effort," Erfan explains the veneered MDF door with steel reinforcement.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, floor space is what you sell — or what gives value to the property,” Erfan says.
"A real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you touch, and they help to create an emotional connection to your home," Erfan says.
"You're not going to fall in love with an electric cable in the wall.
This is important, but it does not make the tongues of the heart ring.”
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can even make you want to not leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
Nothing counts except the amount of money earned, besides which any ethics is forgotten.
He sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is a version of the business world of Card House – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech mane is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less frame-like the element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers begins to emerge more and more.
A life-changing experience will be the protagonist’s son’s cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
His son, dreaming of being an architect, makes his father, on his walks to the big buildings of Chicago, think about things that are truly important, such as faith, kindness, love... not even the catastrophe of the twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have set out to make the audience cry for sure, because even the most hardhearted spectator can’t hold back tears from seeing the suffering of a sweet, cancer-stricken boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deed to the old man looking for a job.
Now I bet on myself in my mind - if the movie has a happy end, I reward my insight after the movie with coffee, but if I’m wrong, I can praise the screenwriter for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there’s a suspicion that I’m going to lose my coffee – when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man runs slowly down the hallway toward the room.
Instead, the son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive thing, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I know how to predict the end of the American drama.
In truth, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are in place.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will bring you in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
The White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump, in the hope that it will keep the chief in a flatter water.
Here's a snippet from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he highlighted a key issue in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad information into the president’s hands.
Kelly told officials that information must pass through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information.
Kelly’s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not disappeared.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly featured in the affected publications," former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told the Politico in February.
At the time, Tara Palmeri wrote that “six former campaign workers said that the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady hymn of praise.”
All right. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s habits of using Twitter have once been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their intervention.
We’ll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing cliques, people are exclusively trying to advance their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of the advisors to provide the president with information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may react to negative press, especially damaging information leaks, explosively, obsessing with finding their source.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone happily gave the president a printed copy of an article on the internet-provocator Charles C. Johnson’s GotNews.com website that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House’s “source of multiple information leaks.”
It doesn’t matter whether Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mockery, or that he didn’t offer any concrete evidence, or that he has also made false accusations and withdrawn them in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking his subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, and Rob Porter, head of the White House office, “have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump.”
How did you do that?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad do not get permission to perform bitterly.
There are a lot of foreigners playing music in Tallinn city centre.
Those with whom <0xC3><0x95>htuleht spoke admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was evident that the musicians, wearing dreadlocks and bursting clothes, were backpackers who could use a shower.
Regardless of the appearance, the only woman in the group played a song with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man jongled with three balls beside her and called the passers-by closer.
A third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked his own twisted crap in a heartbeat.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the balls, said they were playing music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the group’s presentation was to collect the ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the same evening.
When asked if they asked the city for permission to play music in the Old Town, they shook Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in a city for more than a day or a couple of days, and mostly permits are given for a month or something like that.
It doesn’t make sense to pay for it,” Bob explained.
When we arrived at the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were chasing them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Centre to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
"We're here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," said pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware of the need to have the permission of the city government to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
“Of course, when the police come, we’ll go somewhere else, but we’ll have to try,” he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>149 million in July as part of the euro area central banks’ public sector asset purchase programme, while the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.36 billion.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information about purchases.
In reply to the interpellation of members of the Riigikogu, the Governor of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained that the Eurosystem’s central banks’ asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds of the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest elsewhere.
The effect of purchases is to reduce the return on lower-risk assets and to motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases its own national government bonds in the context of the public sector bond purchase programme, while other sovereign bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of covered bonds is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as bonds from the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as part of the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds as of June 2016.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds will be purchased by the Finnish Central Bank on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Migrants ignore the trench and return to "millionaires' district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again confronted with a fierce confrontation of determined travelers who have ignored the ditch excavated by the council to regain a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field near Solihull Street, a wealthy “millionaire district”.
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and lorries after being expelled only in May, without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the guards by squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed section that had been left as a footpath.
The rabid residents have cursed Solihull's council, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being expelled from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passersby.
The council must be shamed so that they take action, because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came in last night, probably more today.”
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook and I’m not happy to have to continue paying the council tax if the council can’t even stop something like this.”
A local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased, and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grasslands."
A Solihull Council spokesman said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground near Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with the Solihull police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
When gathering evidence, it is very helpful for as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the courts when we present the case to them.”
Minister of Culture Indrek Saar is also visiting the Weekend Festival, among others, and he is pleased that he has been able to bring true world top names to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival for three days.
However, he acknowledges that the real players in his field have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our region," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists perform at the festival, however, speak the most about the island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for older people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his turning of the record, at some point we all have turned our feet on ourselves,” he says.
There are several other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.
Take a look at the evening video.
Audi updates up to 850,000 diesel cars in the midst of criticism
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company described these actions as recalls.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
For automotive companies, the cost of installing equipment to neutralise diesel emissions into the air is also increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs that point to the problem.
Companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating its mistakes, which silenced the use of so-called deceptive devices, which enabled it to adjust its exhaust readings to meet the regulations when testing the car, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore unprotected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thus expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a big blow for Volkswagen, a luxury car manufacturer that generates a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s profits.
European Union flags will be purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive a European Union flag measuring 105x158 centimeters.
The flags are intended to be displayed indoors, they must be carried out indoors with high-quality printing technology, also with tunnel mounting, according to the ERR news portal.
The sign reads: "Gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is estimated by the Ministry of Education to be 20,000 euros, i.e. one ticket will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Weekly Riodoce staff usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and endless drug warfare.
But today they have gathered under the guise of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior writers discuss which seems safer: to take the children with them to the office that was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters for names in each column to provide evidence no need, impressions and intuition are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by the government or cartels, along with a list of villains who make it dangerous to portray the chaos in Mexico.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the greater the number of bodies that are accumulating across the country, the greater the number of journalists since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection after the attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists in seven parts of the country have been killed this year.
Among the dead is their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the façade of the Riodoce building, with a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger with the inscription "Justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss the common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime, which reach thousands, journalist killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to reflect on the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killer's data and justice, the security meeting won't be of much use, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you will mistrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on May 15th.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably due to the name of the newspaper, which translates as "the twelfth river".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is mainly silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival clicks fight to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter if the streets of Sinaloa are shot every day by a few or even several people, or if the cemetery is filled with abundance of decorated double-kings mausoleums that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime implies that there is only one cartel running a coastal state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels immense remorse that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, who was a clicker of a cartel competing with Guzman’s sons and at war.
This piece of writing may have aroused the sons by suspected gang members who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper editorial covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling <0x24>50 shares.
Bojorquez said it was "impossible to deal with the press in Sinaloa without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters enjoyed publishing vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its repertoire in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for his courage to follow Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to accept the task that comes with being a journalist is another way to play dumb.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the joker who snitched like a sailor, the friend who kindly gave hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal for him.
His death has also led them to question themselves as to how best to do their work and survive.
“They don’t like it when you mess with their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things should not be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-maintenance even in the best times.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the sense of smell can be deceived... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say Sinaloa no longer has the old rules, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat under a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters wondered, half-jokingly, whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has labeled unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous countryside, where de facto drug gangs control.
Riodoce’s edition of this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when writing what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in widespread cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We'd have known before what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sleek physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been interrupted."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists to do on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed the next morning to the prosecutor’s office for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt body was found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists all over the country have become louder and are scolding the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest against walkways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to mobilise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be redirected from the government's activities, worrying that hatred had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organized crime, complicit state officials, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders of politicians and security forces who are affiliated with organised crime.
Last year, the media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and state officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want you to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blood-staining.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, a northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, saying, "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to his cut-off head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to do what the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they still have to hide in the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that her coverage of the drug business scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
On a recent Friday at midnight, when the latest number was already locked, Riodoce editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office, drinking beer when everyone’s phones suddenly began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were reportedly killed in shootings between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day, I needed a change.
Sirens were blazing along another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the police officers on guard to see if they were on guard.
If they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees edited his footsteps.
"How could you even think of closure," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, an apprentice asked me to send him out to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur uses protective color to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit quite frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first discoveries of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his skin covered with armor was of a reddish-brown color, and his past had been somewhat "complex".
A report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to National Geographic, this equation-covered vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil ever found.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, they worked to excavate the animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100-pound) plot of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready for public disclosure.
"If you tweak your eyes a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
While examining his skin, scientists found that this herbivore, though covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely significantly endangered by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This largely armored dinosaur used red and white protective colors to hide from predators, and used a sheltering technique called counter-shadow, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to better blend in with its surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely hunting him.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaurian creature first came to the news in May and is now available for visit at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory worker at the Borealopelta markmitchell museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal to the painstaking discovery.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armor on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclipsing, a conservation method common in the animal kingdom, meaning that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although the counter-shadow is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealopetta is much larger than the animals that live in shadow today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide as a survival tactic rather than confrontation.
However, most modern counter-eclipsing animals, such as deer, zebras, or armadillos, are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a huge dinosaur covered in armor shows just how dangerous dinosaur predators from the Cretaceous could be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the armours also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal to get clues about its life, including the remaining contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell dead into the river, thus flowing into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with the preserved scaled skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it’s enough to squeeze your eyes and it feels like you’re asleep.”
The Cretaceous era was a time when huge bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs roamed the Earth—theropods.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopetta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 meters) tall monster and a six-ton-weight monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopella was washed into the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and is complete from the cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) tall and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long spikes burst out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore traveled through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river washed into its open sea.
But the dinosaur’s undersea burial site helped preserve its scales in fine detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the skulls of the dinosaur along the crippled armour plates.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “This degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it feels.
The petrified skin remains still cover the bumpy armor plates on the skull of the animal.
The right forefoot lies next to him, and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the armor on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York City, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah’s posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast a live tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that night he saw tweets that reported people gathering on Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of a police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream of a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another policeman said he tipped a gun and yelled, “I’m going to kill all of you...animals.”
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "This is unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to, and we could call it typical."
I felt scared at that moment.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
When he landed at 11 p.m., he went to his father’s to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the next morning they would go alone to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary, Whose Streets?, which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of those who live in this community and who filled the streets with demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown on their head, drove to Ferguson, they again discussed the experiences and living conditions of blacks, which had been repeatedly discussed before this morning.
“Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?” she recalls asking herself.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
“What’s happening now is the culmination of what’s happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in it.
He must learn about activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him without personally experiencing blatant racism, he is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a terrible service if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they reached Ferguson was on South Florissant, a place across the street from the police station that had become a sort of campground where activists were waiting for news of a police officer named Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunch.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Union of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It's all just settled."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met one of the film’s co-directors, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were simply trying to document what was happening.
Ferrelli wondered, “Are you trying to document what’s happening, or are you trying to find a story that can be exploited?”
This skepticism was due to the countless instances of people, often white, coming into the community and trying to take advantage of its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already shaken hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the area known for his activism in connection with death row prisoners.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the team in Whose Streets? for years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were depicted, because that's how I'm depicted."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience -- to show that the movement was not "a redeemer's guide, but a community gathering," as Folayan said -- he became the most open actor in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw a finished linen work.
“But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
What’s more, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and re-focuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three instigators of the movement who posted the theme <0x23>BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin are homosexual.
"Black gay women in the leading role have generally sustained the movement," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
“Black homosexual women must bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he argues that "there is no such thing as creating equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who was blowing the right energy out of him," he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at such junctions is a lot at stake.
Its energy can be perceived through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the demonstration, Ferrelli was sentenced to two-and-a-half years of probation for blocking the road.
He describes the socio-political climate in the region he calls home simply as a “smooth boom.”
Nevertheless, he still holds the importance of the mantra he has etched in his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
7 ways to get over a hangover after a weekend party
Some of the toughest male boys will find a party after a drink to help with what's wrong.
Or, as the saying goes, “Avoid hangovers, stay drunk.”
But this is only an inevitable delay and a decent health bump.
What can you do to make you feel better in the morning after today’s and tomorrow’s Weekend trail – or any other celebration – and get over a hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Drinking alcohol on and off, after a big party in the morning... or maybe even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid by drinking alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
With water, minerals are also washed out of the body and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
Surely it wouldn’t be worth it to go to Grandma’s house with a hangover to break down trees – this could prove to be a fatal wrong decision.
But a simple walk will help your body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Lie in a tent and sleep out of a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give your body energy slowly and gently.
If you’re already vomiting from yesterday’s overdrinking, it’s definitely not worth trying to load your stomach with a big fat steak.
Start with fresh juice, for example, which contains fruit sugars to calmly revitalize your body.
If your health is bad at lunchtime, you might want to try a broth.
And a little later, back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic frees your body from even the last piece of water.
As I said before, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose performance.
That way, you'll ruin your liver even more, and the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don’t do it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already sore stomach.
When you don’t have a partner, you get along well with yourself.
It works just like walking, but you can’t have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding.
Talk stupidly to your friends and co-sufferers, do simple nonsense, and laugh kindly about yourself and others.
Jokes and laughter may not make you hungover, but they certainly make it more fun to tolerate the aftermath.
Someday, the hangover will pass anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Arrested for Murder
Police say a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is being sought nationwide after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday without bail for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim with multiple puncture wounds on the body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators treat the stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an e-mail that Lathem has now been suspended from work and is banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail: “We have been in touch with the British police and are ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies in any way we can.”
Warren’s colleagues are shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges the suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine their exact location," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities would help search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptographic tip that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
According to the police, it was an ugly sight.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras were confirming Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza administration sent a letter to residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of the events and the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family quarrel."
Startups to Help Your Business Avoid Becoming the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were ineffective.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to guarantee anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who leads the 75-employee e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outsiders.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hotline of complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City’s Glint startup, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has been using Glint, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys targeted at specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to keep up with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment where those who dared to speak out were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation, and compliance could be worth more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology statistics website.
Convercent, a Colorado-based start-up that helps businesses prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, noticed interest and increased activity this year against the backdrop of Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized pulsed surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been usurped by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convert for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of regulations and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday General Counsellor James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convert, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment, or dishonest wage practices that did not reach managers previously operating in offices in other cities or states more quickly.
“I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values, and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media matured” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from publicly washing online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies periodic fees for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent was funded in February by <0x24>10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the value of the capital raised to <0x24>47 million.
Glint invested <0x24>10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to <0x24>60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in a company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of the General Benefit and Employee Experience department at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors earn revenue when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
While third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they’re getting support.
Data on employee involvement is important, according to work culture experts.
However, these data are useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough, or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consultancy and business management company, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because when things aren’t finished, the employees are thinking, ‘Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disillusioned employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
However, new employee data is being collected on Ruby Tuesdays and it is hoped that in the long run this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
“If you’re not committed to transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.”
The Baltics are the bright star of the euro area: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the wealthy countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free-market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few in the euro area where real GDP per capita by purchasing power has significantly converged to the EU average," the central bank said in a statement.
Although the aim is to equate the total economic output per capita with the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 the total production per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimate that their economies are doing very, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily exercises makes Bruins’ days long
It’s almost 11 p.m. when a group of UCLA footballers stop to chat at the edge of the team’s new practice field on campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, exposing their sweaty back from the effort of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these force minutes offer a noon break.
After three hours of training, the participants will return to the dorm for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily training sessions to reduce players’ burden has actually made their days longer — at least until the final exams were completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
Switching from two workouts a day means more one-workout days – the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in the six seasons of Mora Westwood, the workouts will take place during the summer courses.
They have 18 sessions scheduled until August 20, before official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M begin in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another point to the players’ tight schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they will break through this trial; they will struggle, they will be wonderful young people.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it will be really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA’s training sessions will be closed, which is not an easy task given the clear view of their courts from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a top-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have bypassed the defense grid around the gatepost.
As of this weekend, the Bruins have been occupying the hotel, but Mora admitted that there may be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a training session.
If you have a record of your workout, it can make a pretty good deal.
But we're using security teams over there and at the eighth parking lot.
We do our best to use what we have.
I'm trying not to worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place."
In retaliation, the Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition, which was born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who had been forced to leave the EKRE, will be brought to the attention of the parties.
But chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for them all.
Who stays with Savage?
If the supporters of Edgar Savisaar have shrunk, one can guess from the events organised in honor of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present centre-party members and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s loyal supporters and friends are avoiding applying in Tallinn be sought from the fact that the “List of Savisaar” of the thieves, which is led by corrupt donors and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the rooftop of the city government for a Russian-language pop song with the participation of Lasnamäe district’s elder; and in every sense a primitive computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid squirrels and squirrels on the road when riding a bike - is this how the Centre Party is trying to get the votes of voters aged 16 and 17 for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what the other parties think about a youth-friendly election campaign.
If Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers from the beginning of August watch a black square instead of an entertainment programme, two options remain: agree that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels will be shown on free television, or hand over a decade to a television operator each month.
There are probably also those who, at first, publicly welcome the ad-free television experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television images and advertisements.
Sounding music, noisy people and the garbage left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to get a part of the noise, instead of having a headache at home, it’s worth exploring your homeland – and leaving a sleeping spot for festival guests for a large amount of money.
Washington is changing the rules of the Green Card
The media quotes President Donald Trump as saying that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned that will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan includes a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The Act will reduce chain migration and will replace the current programme.
“The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the Mana River.
He works 140 kilometers from his home as a driver in a gold cart near the Kuwait tributary, Maana.
It is hard work: two months in a row, 12 hours of work without rest days, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years he has worked at Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There's a tough time," says Anatoli, "when you go in, you make sure you don't bring the vodka, and when you go out, you make sure you don't take the gold."
Mare Piho is chatting with local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told her a lot about her family’s memories in Siberia.
The still-preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Seto will also affect the home Seto, because it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare, who studied the distant Seto, thinks the most thoroughly.
This year, his first trip to Siberia will be 30 years.
He has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers emigrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to obtain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'd say 8,000.
I figured it out from the stories of Siberian Seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this area!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (floating logs), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New-Petersburg, many sets later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marrying each other and having many children.
With seven or eight children, it was normal.
How different is the culture of the Siberian Seto people from that of the Siberian Seto people?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They made their own clothes, but they always made a difference between what was brought with them and what was made here.
Climate change has had a major impact on Seto’s traditional clothing, as it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.

The connection to the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is starting to give back to it, is starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July for the Seto Kingdom Day and lived in their homes for four days - J.P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to come and go to the tackle, because the city has a great location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the highways," says opera soloist Reigo Tamm from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have lots of nature, sports and cultural places, and pizza can be found on every corner.
Tapa is a top-top city!
There is a small island by the Valgejõgi River, which runs through the town, where slaughterers tend to have a party.
"You can't see that beautiful place from the train window," giggles Reigo.
He who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, for the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming there, I can do it.
You can have a picnic on the river and simply make a romance - you can watch the river flow and think about life before and after.
I also went for a walk with my girlfriends.
In addition to everything else, Tamm has been to the riverbank between three bridges to practice his aria: "Since this place is on the edge of the city, no one may even come back when they whine about their stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from the Männikumäki hill, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now, for example, play disc golf - the golf course is done, discs can be borrowed from the fitness centre," says Reigo.
Old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't made it there yet.
We will probably have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and he has discs.
Maybe he'll lend me some!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the modern operasolist.
At least during the skiing hours.
There are a lot of tears, disappointments and victories left on this mountain in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city is currently full of construction work, all this will become unknown," says Reigo.
Tapa’s old and tired gym building, however, is a very attractive place where summer productions are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the head of R.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatrical season “Aleksei with Karenin” has just ended, on August 11th there will be “Elluawaise” at the railway station, while the old station building will be moving around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the city of Tapa will be a day, during which the open home cafes and a series of cultural events, including a national rally, will be held," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city during those days.
In a small yellow house on the 1st May boulevard, the museum has been in existence since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information," Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military.
Reigo smiles at the fact that if Tapa goes through all the recommended places, after a while it will get hungry, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such great dining places and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” she says.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international company all around you.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
BTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegal campers on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who gets caught resting in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves that teach puppies go to break sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa have to give the wolves “learning material” about their herd again after a year’s break – apparently the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight have been injured, writes Hiiu Lehti.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency that wolf nests were not born in Hiiumaa last year and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolf nests have been fixed on the island are also in sync with the breaks.
The wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another who had to be slaughtered.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Genetically Modified Organisms Release into the Environment (GMOVS) Act and the Plant Protection Act to the approval circle.
The amendment to the Act will refrain from creating a separate database for the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for operators, for this purpose the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
At least until the decision has been made to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, Head of Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The Bill repeals the provisions of the GMOVS relating to the database of locations and handlers of GM crops and the training on handling, establishes the requirements for handling GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers of the start of GM crop cultivation will be replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of the Bills and, if they wish, to submit their opinions to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed to grow - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that in Estonia there is no corn pest, European stalk, against which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this maize line are bred in the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect possible contamination by GM organisms in the seeds of different varieties of summer rape, corn and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the results of the study concluded that the seeds of the varieties of rape, corn and soya grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
It can be inferred from the above that no GM crops are deliberately grown in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Maticu after midfielder Sampdoria made her debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought over from Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million started in United’s last pre-season game in Dublin before winning 2-1 against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing with the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive.
But after being out of the Blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was badly lacking in the form of a match and lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get to form as soon as possible.”
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started in the initial line-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly started setting up his eleven starting men for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work" by signing contracts with three of his four priorities.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another stork cub got a GSM transmitter on his foot on August 1, and this time in Muhu.
According to the birdwatcher Mati Martinson, who lives in Sõrve, the first stork was born in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and has joined Mullutu-Suurlahe’s large overnight accommodation pool.
This is because there is no grain field in Sõrve, writes the Voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cranes, another young stork got attached to the transmitter and this on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is in fact an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year a young stork named Mati was supplied with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türju.
"His activities are all online: how he went to Spain to winter, how he came back for a long time on the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British Inventor Puts Microchip Into His Body To Get Into House And Car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open his front door, get into the office, and even start a car with a simple gesture.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip inserted between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, charging <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
This married one-child father has now installed the technology in both his home and his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House Exhibit Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
According to military documents released by TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the southern yard for an American production event last month cost taxpayers as much as <0x24>24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One during the president's time on board, was the central attraction of the event introducing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials on their tour reviewed industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) squadron responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military detachment required the helicopter's presence with the FARGO shortly 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an e-mail the day before the event to his superior, a senior naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern yard on July 17 for an event starting around 7 a.m. and stay there until the yard is cleaned between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
The fact was added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, the return flight would require a second equipment due to working time constraints.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft during its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to TIME magazine whether a second ekipause was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that the HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could be in breach of this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," the deputy chief officer replied.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and it would not have been covered by Hatch's law.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the President supported the efforts of health reform that were being discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep the government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump was spotted during his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, when the president’s plane rolled in the background, and his Twitter account is filled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president’s plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of 'made in America', which featured products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often conduct test flights around Washington and in the southern yard to practice putting down the President of the United States at the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
While Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American-made" event was included in the study flight norm for the flight crew that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors on the event burdened the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organizing the exhibition of the helicopter in the southern yard.
The HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents for the president's flights, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron documents indicated the flight length from its base at the naval aerodrome in Quantico, Virginia, for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The point is to show the things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the states of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment on which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it.”
It is unclear whether Trump encountered a helicopter during a tour of the southern courtyard, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky’s representatives, making fun of the company’s products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko – through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegus, Shadeiko was hit in the final area, with a 800-metre leg cramp, and a girl was taken off the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had gotten a zero in a long-distance jump on a Universiade held in China.
At the 2012 European Championships in Helsinki, he was injured, but at the debut Olympics in London he finished 23rd with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow World Championships, the Estonian long jumper on the Estonian record schedule suffered a thumb injury.
Two years later, he took the 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but this was also a disappointment for the athlete who wanted more.
Shadeiko passed the hardest jumble last year, when he did not get the result at the European Championships in Amsterdam.
I just want to do a good multiplayer one time.
Once," Shadeiko confessed.
The worst was ahead of him: a month later, his Olympics in Rio was interrupted by the first barrier due to a thigh injury.
Time has come to take off – can we continue with the seventh race?
Is two days worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my mind cleared.
It’s a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I’ve been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that was just supposed to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal myself and to think clean.
"I knew I wasn't putting the pills in my bag yet," Shadeiko says about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page clean and move on with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to see the suffering of the caregiver, but she realized that first and foremost the athlete had to find out about himself.
He was so overwhelmed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
There is some peace in him now.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points at the Götzis multi-competition.
In the high-level race, he improved his personal top mark by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a near-record time obstacle run.
Then the multi-competitor felt that this was by no means a ceiling of abilities, but that the extinguished became just the first craving for competition.
He has been instructed by Hill for years and says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a good athlete, he's a good trainer.
When something is wrong or wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we need to start with.
I cannot tell you exactly what to do and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Shadeiko.
“I’m not the one who makes the maximum in training,” he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Your baby’s happiness makes you happy.
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of his loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete have recently become parents, and the multiplayer has received support from new world citizens.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
Drinking alcohol is equivalent to “training” the brain.
According to Livestrong, Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
“It’s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, it’s about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By smelling the glass, swirling the wine in our mouths, enjoying it and sensing aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules don’t actually contain flavor, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taster of wine," says Sheperd.
Other things that influence the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Shepherd, of course, warns that wine is not meant to get drunk.
“There has to be more,” he says.
If you drink too much, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefiting – a 2004 study found that people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk loss of memory, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity.
10% of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less than their colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less than their colleagues.
There is a 10% pay gap between men and women, according to Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT sector wage survey.
The total number of posts covered was 8,577.
63% of the posts were held by men.
"Although only three companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap in the opinion of the rest of the companies, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the men's basic monthly salary is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total annual salary of men is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar Põhjala, an analyst at Fontes.
'Narcose' Season 3 Advertising Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel is at the centre of the Netflix hit series

In the third season, the DEA turns its attention to the richest drug-trading organization in the world - the Cali cartel.

The third season of "Narcos" will open on September 1.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Role in Politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the UN Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for Vice President, and more than 30 percent of recent registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of women's role," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local Soviet elections and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period during which the role of international military operations becomes consultative.
This year's election marks the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything cooler, big and small alike.
There is always too little time together, but training with the kids is a good opportunity to combine being together, playing, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you will always have the live handkerchiefs with you and they will impatiently remind you with their thin voice: "Let's work out now too!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to play a regular game of heads or to slip along the coastline.
Kukk is the foundation for staying in the shape of feet and buttocks - who would want to take the shape of a sand cake that washed off the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
Advanced ones can also do squats with pretty big kids.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to be high and important.
Older children can also do the squats themselves.
Set the scale of the movement by touching the ground and stretching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, tell the miniature to hold tight.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it’s easy to make it more fun!
Game plank: take a long plank column to sneak through in turns.
In fact, it’s harder than usual, but much more fun to do when in the meantime you can give a friend a hand.
To add to the load, you can stick to the plank, a little on the back, and also walk around in this position.
The extra difficulty can be to put a smaller child on the hips, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs slip through the sand, triceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscles get strained like a snap.
The child descends on his legs so that his body weight is equally divided between the front and the back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Curve your legs and stretch straight up.
The thrill can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The additional load is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot more fun with their abdominal muscles in pairs and claps.
Handicraft and heart rate squat.
Keep an eye on your child’s safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorites and great fun!
For the parent while being really effective throughout the body workout.

From the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Shoulder-woven bags are a summer classic, which in recent years has become a hit product in its own right, which a true summer enthusiast must even hang on his arm, and on which merchants have been able to weld a price tag suitable for a hit, despite its modest origin.
A shoulder-woven bag is probably one of the things that has existed in everyone’s life and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, then nothing's broken.
But now the straw bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have replaced their exquisite designer bags with simple straw-woven bags for the summer months.
It’s not just a beach bag, it’s just as popular today as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk into the office with it.
Here, however, it is worth clarifying beforehand whether a summer look like this is still sitting on the boss or whether it is worth pushing the pine and laptop to a somewhat more formal sumada.
Variety has made straw bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that fashion gourmets rush to the local market as the first thing on a holiday trip and buy themselves some straw bags, to which they will be faithful throughout the holiday period, which will accompany you on the beach, on the market and also hanging out with friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a lot of bags on the market and sell them or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to become the happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, as it is rare that in the fashion world it is possible to buy something that has become a hit for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that the richer customers don’t feel like mere mortals who walk around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag for over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000.
For Chanel’s interpretation of the shoulder bag, however, it is worth around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,000.
Unlike most fashion designers, straw bags do not come from some big fashionable ones, but their story began farther away.
It is said that straw bags originated in the far Philippines, where they have been widely transported.
Weaving shoulder bags there is primarily an export trade and the locals are not often seen walking around with them.
It is said that the straw weaving technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket weaving.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be woven as hard as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into them, which make the bag more personal and therefore more attractive.
For example, recently there have been especially trendy bags with colored ribbons or leather strips in them.
A thank you letter can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, whose biggest weaved shoulder bag fan has never been seen before.
In fact, he matched the shoulder bag with all kinds of clothing sets and didn’t even want to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
The popularity of these bags is not less important nowadays, but the fact that taking care of them is the head of a rooster and unlike many other Sudanese people, they do not have to be cared for with special tools, but water and a wet towel do the same.
As always, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations in addition to the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a ribbon wrapped with straw or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on the shoulder bag it does.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been regarded as a classical bag, which resembles a basket in its style, is open on the top and has shorts, as well as handles made of straw.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the executives of McVitie's cookie maker to confirm their long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross object.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the object over the past few years.
Workers were hired there, and the chairmen of the trade union "are the first to hear" when something changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's company with a request to "resolve concerns that the funding will not be used to modernize production lines".
Drew Duffy, senior organizer at GMB, said: “The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site’s CEO about Tollcross’ business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, and is an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living expenses and a chronic decline in production, the eastern part of Glasgow needs a rapidly growing company at McVitie.
Pladis’ representative said: “The Tollcross site manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between employees and representatives of GMB at Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all of our companies and sites - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the operation of the site, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in the quest to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This thrilling approach has opened a summer transition window, and Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overbought set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from PSG after payment.
Barcelona is, of course, angry at both the approach and Neymar’s release, although a source close to Catalans’ board of directors confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the player since his arrival at Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the world of football about this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi harshly warned all clubs thinking about hiring some of PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’re going to confront them and get in touch with them,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG’s midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
After Brexit, Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he said.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since this is not possible, he would prefer to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s exit smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could certainly have one with Britain.”
An alternative would be to return to customs posts that would declare historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," he said.
He called Brexit “a challenge for our generation” and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Mart Avandi, who completed his first semi-long triathlon: anyone can pass the Ironman.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries took part in the half-length Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km swimming, 90 km cycling and 21.1 km cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi finished the first triathlon of his life victoriously.
"I thought it would be difficult and it was difficult in the end," Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that in fact, triathlon is a feasible head for everyone.
"It's not distance that kills, it's pace that kills," he said, implying that almost everyone reaches the finish line at an affordable pace.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: “Ot’s physical body is fine, but unfortunately he can’t swim.”
Avandi had been training since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
At 5:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piiraja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who was a “good example person” last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the men's race in Otepää, which belonged to the Ironman series, was German Johannes Moldan with 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while among the Estonians Maria Jänesen lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
He completed 1.9 km of swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at position 410.
