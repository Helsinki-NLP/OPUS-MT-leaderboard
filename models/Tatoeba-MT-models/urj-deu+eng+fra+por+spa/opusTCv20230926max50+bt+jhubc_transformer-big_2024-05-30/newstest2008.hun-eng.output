Inflation in Europe has fallen on food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the steep increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with annual inflation of 3.1% after 2.6 per cent in October, the European Union’s Statistical Office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast was only 3% likely, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base rate, saying that the cut, along with rising commodity prices and lessening unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in its twenty-two trap: “Turn off inflation” so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent in November was a record for twelve years; in Spain, it rose from 4.1 to 3.6.
Eurozone inflation was driven by rising food and energy prices.
Wheat quotes have risen by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached their highest level since 1973.
Eating oil and dairy products also had to pay significantly more in 2007.
World oil prices have risen by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost nearly <0x24>100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% over the next three to four months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to have fallen interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup is experiencing a government crisis
Fidesz’s supporters have grown significantly by the beginning of December after a long period of stagnation, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has never seen such low socialist support of 13 percent before.
In the case of the party voters, the difference – due to the greater determination of the opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71%) of the support of the MSZP compared to one-fifth (20%) of the support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is 2%.
There are 1% more supporters of both camps among the polling party voters.
The economic climate has also deteriorated to its previous lowest point – it has never been so high, with 41% of those who considered the country’s economic situation to be extremely bad, while another 46% said it was quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the changes in their financial situation after the more hopeful outlook in spring and summer.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only one-tenth of the improvement.
In December, more than any previous poll by Gallup, 71 percent of the respondents said that the Prime Minister was doing his job more badly than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány 13 percent of the respondents trust or very trust, while in Viktor Orbán 38 percent of the respondents are in favour.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister, 27% do not trust the Fidesz President.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be managed without a change of government.
While 35 per cent thought it was desirable after the riots in October last year to keep the government and the head of government, at the moment this figure is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) only sees the solution in calling new elections.
When asked about the intention to participate in the referendum, 60 percent of the respondents said they would definitely go, and another 20 percent said they would probably go.
In comparison, only 55 per cent would be sure to participate in the “sunday parliamentary elections” and another 15 per cent would consider it likely. The outcome of the referendum would not be in question based on the current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent to visits, and 84 percent to hospital allowances.
If we only look at the same percentages among those who promised to take part in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition, visitation and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive is Auchan, raised by almost a fifth by Tesco
In the trade triangle in Budaörs, the hypermarkets maintained an average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
The Daily Economy Article
This year, on average, the usual Christmas basket of the Day grew by 16 percent in the Budaörs trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase in value well above a thousand forints.
As the prices in grocery stores have already “slipped” in December last year, there was no drastic increase in the percentage compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they got last year for just nine thousand forints, now they can’t even get it for ten thousand.
The Daily basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 HUF by at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, but turkey breast fillets, walnuts and poppy seeds were also very expensive.
The prices of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not push the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter returnable bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so they asked for only 257 forints for the product, including the deposit fee.
This year, however, the Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while the Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased the prices in the Daily Cart by about 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Daily Cart by about 18 to 18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive was 21 percent.
The average increase in forints was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1,206, so that last Christmas the increase in VAT made its impact felt in the prices.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, and the stores were apparently unable to decide how much margin they would apply to each product, as they were unable to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the speed of rotation of a product is badly planned by the trader, it can benefit greatly from a margin adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive one was HUF 1,720 more than in 2006, while the cheapest one had a price difference of only HUF 844.
This extreme did not show up this year, as the most expensive one was 1,630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1,284 forints more expensive.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the HCSO: for some basic foodstuffs, the statistical office recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over a 12-month period.
In addition to eggs, for example.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the already rather expensive product last year produced a price increase of less than 10 percent compared to the base, even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg producers, and the drastic increase in price levels has also been tricked by the multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, the majority of shoppers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the durable foods from the shelves.
On Wednesday morning, in all three department stores, serious queues were formed in front of the cash registers, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that in rural areas traffic is weaker, and many people complain to research companies that even their plans for revenues are lagging behind, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
Savings on disinfectants in many places
More than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to the inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the head of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
A bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a man after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but had to return with MRSA shortly afterwards, and an important surgery could not be performed because of the bacteria in his body.
1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System by 10 December this year, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that infections caused by so many multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest is not known.
Approximately two-thirds (683 infections) of the infections are caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are well curable.
However, when antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into highly resistant bacteria that spread quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently impaired, it can cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis - in patients with a weak body, elderly or low weight.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, only MRSA is not there, said Tibor Kanulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
“We isolate such patients, the nursing staff supplies them with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Kanulasi.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital are tested for the presence of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
There is no sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current Hungarian hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection typically occurs in hospitals, elderly homes, hospitals should monitor patients entering and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It is also important that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most of the cases are revealed when a patient has a detectable MRSA infection, the head of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to drugs, but this is not always the case in hospitals.
Microbiological samples are even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Save on disinfectants
There is scientific evidence that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through the mediation of medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant deficiencies in this in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate an infected patient.
In fact, the hospital rooms are often crowded, often very close to each other, although epidemiologically patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz noted that hospitals in a financially unfavourable situation save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so the chances of developing infections are even higher.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, less such infection can be detected or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treating an MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurers, so it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government included prevention and reduction of MRSA in its programme.
The program appears to be successful, with MRSA infections showing a decreasing trend in England, according to the reported data.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the police captain of District XXII has been prepared.
It can be excluded that the police captain of the XXII district, who had resigned from his position while drunk or intoxicated, had killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, said Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Metropolitan Attorney General’s Office, on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter was prepared.
The expert’s opinion supported the primary finding, which had already established that the former police chief had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII district precinct, in his own car, on Tuesday, while cornering Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, hit the 55-year-old man who was stepping in front of him, who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing point.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is otherwise not a mitigating circumstance according to the rules of the highway, the turning car must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Due to the events, the district police chief resigned his position and requested his retirement, the police said, because the incident shocked him so much.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors who conducted the investigation from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed three EUR 400 million credit line agreements with Minister of Finance János Veres and Vice-President Marta Gajecka on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Development Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million euro envelope for financing transport and environment projects in Hungary from the Cohesion Fund, of which the parties had already signed a 100 million euro loan agreement, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining 200 million euro.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement will also be used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a 50 million euro contract, which the budget will primarily use for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, we also talked about Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the subway with the EU, they will return to the question of whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Janos Veres, this will take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest rate on the loans is linked to the EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years, and is granted by the EIB without a maintenance commission.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying in the EU’s still cheaper, but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular property purchase destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, and on the beach are Albena, the "Golden Beach", the "Sun Beach", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max Bulgarian analysts, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract investors – including Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people are buying in the extremely cheap Rus area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces promising the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe’s most attractive golf havens, making it one of the top destinations in the summer and winter seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already making large purchases, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and an increasing number from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and the Black Sea and ski resorts have traditionally attracted many Russian customers.
Foreign customers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or demolished old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a big city, shops and the proximity of the local doctor in general.
The second category belongs to holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business-oriented investors who buy in the hope of medium- to long-term value increase.
The price of the capital’s real estate is constantly rising as the demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, it has increased by 21% annually in the last five years.
The rise in real estate prices is far outweighing the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent of Hungarians
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the talks with the ministers will continue with the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to follow the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a heated debate on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will commit themselves not only to reducing emissions, but also to providing both financial and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
There is also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, as provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, which is expected to be part of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), according to Market and Profit.
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU would undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the "post-2012 agreement", and was ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 per cent if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries were willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol set a target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, including the EU – then the 15 Member States – committed to a reduction of minus 8 per cent.
The obligation for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will fulfill, the Ministry of the Environment’s press release recalls.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate agreement has to be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would definitely be postponed beyond 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol’s reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction scheme, which the IPCC, the latest UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change, pointed out in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and make it inevitable that the global average temperature will rise above 2 degrees Celsius, with extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
Films of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan will be posted on video sharing by British military units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to access YouTube: special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature camera footage will be checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and sent to London, where the natives will upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
The Air Force has posted 139 footage of the air force on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Department of Defense registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007, and posts videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Commonwealth Office and Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to record the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense said it was also a good way to make the general public aware of the true purpose of the military’s presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements, said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, but it inevitably carries some political message, as it in its own way justifies the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The military also has a problem with the fact that in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are added, which also show the deaths of soldiers, for example: in the slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses at the maximum, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
The Iraqi and Afghan military scenes have already made numerous videos on the Internet, which were shot during a sharp deployment, but the British military has only recently received them.
Americans are recruiting a little differently, with America's Army, a free-to-download shooter game in which you can step into the role of a soldier in a more or less lifelike simulation.
There will be a Christmas party at the ministries.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will say goodbye to her with cakes and coffee from 2007.
There are ministries where there will be a live music party, and elsewhere they will bring the Christmas atmosphere to the hearts of officials with rallies and toasts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so fun with power.
Public offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Ministry Christmas party will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but HM is not expecting the employees of the Ministry.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers are given gifts, at the Mission Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, as well as a press reception.
The wallet spends <0x24>25 million on the year-end mood.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are kicking you out of the harness compared to other departments.
The GKM’s party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4,320,000, and approximately 350 guests from the 600 ministerial staff are expected.
At the ceremony of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but there will be performers and raffles.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held in the building of the National Council of Justice (OIT) on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinners as well.
The room rent cost a million forints, and the rest was spent on more than 400 guests.
We know that one department of the NFÜ is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by a tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development, with EU money.
For this purpose, the building of the Vígszínház was rented.
The information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt, as we have not been able to reach the competent person.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which instead of Christmas held a Luca Day Ball on December 7.
They did not ask for money for the use of the OIT's rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister’s toast, and after dinner, we could dance to live music.
In answer to the question of the [origo], it was stated that at the ball there was no obligation to wear a dress or a suit at all.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Government organizes a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a show and a ceremony for the employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth, on the other hand, is officially waiting for her colleagues not for a Christmas party, but for a year-end workshop.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive only coffee and cakes, according to the press department, thus bringing the party out of HUF 350,000.
Minister Gordon Bajnai, however, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas party in its own large hall, for which 436 workers are expected.
Each guest spends 2500 forints for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since Mr. János Veres became Minister, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
But there will be no Bulihangula, the officiality will be reinforced not only by the minister’s speech, but also by the hour of the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year’s reception on January 20, and the Ministry’s Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in the Városliget in Vajdahunyadvár, and according to the ministry, 1000 forints are reserved for the 100 guests per person.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial toast and end with a restrained snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not hosting a Christmas party at all, they told [origo] in the relevant press departments.
The price of the environmental ministry's office Christmas could not be told by the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
Giant Strike Forces Are Gathering
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will form a strike committee coordinating Monday’s indefinite strike.
A protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and the suspension of work will begin on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will surely cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and they will strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will present details of Monday’s strike organized jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Councils.
There will also be a LIGA – MOSCOW strike committee, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, the organizations that join the strike will cease work indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - for the end of the strike that has begun.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
If the law is passed, then the strike committees will meet and decide on how to proceed.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening, possibly at night.
Due to the strike that starts on Monday, significant disruptions in traffic can be expected: work at the railway will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volán-companies may be stopped.
At the same time, there will be semi-track closures in many parts of the country.
Several trade unions and NGOs have joined the strike call, and the list of them is constantly updated on League Day.
Some organisations called for a strike for an indefinite period, while others called for a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, although as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel by rail.
According to the announcements so far, they are on strike at BKV from the start of operations until 13:00, at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Heat Industries Trade Unions are on strike for four hours, and the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers have called for a 2 and 8 hour suspension.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationally, at alternate times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ), which belongs to the SZEF, is conducting a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal on health insurance reform and introduces a new concept for public debate.
The second demand is that the new pension calculation method, due next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, the possibility of entering the system in the case of early retirement should be ensured before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport regarding the railway wings.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the country’s risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
The company’s “risk warning” said that the biggest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that “with the escalation of the ethnic tensions that already exist between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations in Hungary, even violent ethnic clashes may develop in the short term”.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this is due to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: “the public discussion of the Roma issue was allowed by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Gypsy-Hungarian antagonism.”
This deepens the problem, renders normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, as a result of the great national and international media attention, “degraded the image of Hungary abroad significantly, especially in terms of belief in the stability and democratic development of the country”.
It is recalled that as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which gained more and more publicity and momentum from the autumn of 2006, several associations called “national self-defence” were formed in Hungary from the summer of 2007.
“The common feature of these associations is that they define themselves as a civil society organisation, while openly promoting the preparation of their members – even armed – for defence (catastrophe protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, in addition to the incompetence of the police, the army, i.e. the state,” they added.
They noted that this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the anti-political and anti-partisan attitude of society, seeks to put various political aspirations into the civilian cloak.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association are therefore not only used to avoid legal pitfalls of court registration in the case of these associations, but are also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, for example, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this to decide to establish a guard, saying that the organization’s goal was “national self-defense.”
Bulgaria has experienced “gypsy terror” for the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they will set up their own guards as resistance.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat similarly by organizing their own self-defense, according to the Political Capital risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays aren’t all red
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays it has become a common practice to reorganize workdays, which will be fewer next year.
There is no uniform holiday in the United States or the EU.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between a national and a state holiday and a public holiday.
The holidays are mostly related to church holidays and important historical events.
We are also celebrating the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work breaks – the latter just so that the New Year’s guests can rest.
We have a total of 11 red-letter holidays throughout the year.
It is also a national holiday commemorating the Revolution of 1848 on March 15 and October 23, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the state, on 1 May we celebrate work, and on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
We also celebrate Easter, Pentecost and Christmas for two days.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekends according to the calendar, it has become a practice to shift workdays in cases where we would only work a day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that on the preceding Saturdays we do not stay away from work-school.
For many years, when exactly the day immediately before or after the holiday should be worked is regulated by a separate decree of the Minister of Labour.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, both public employees and those in public service relationships.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and due to its purpose, operating even on public holidays.
This year, the work schedule changes only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve are "slipped" by most people, or they use their saved holidays for this purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays in the middle and at the end of the week, so there will be fewer workday shifts than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for a period of four days.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day in exchange for Friday 2 May.
The second relocation is related to the celebration of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday 24th.
The end of the year, however, can be fully in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from 24 December, there will be a non-stop break almost everywhere, even if New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scary things you can do to annoy your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never get, innocent lies that we barely notice: they “color” everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or whether you wear gloves and consciously avoid situations that are misunderstood and annoy others.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been calling from the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret and try to make up for it, possibly calling the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less usual solution).
Most of the time, an apology is done.
Before making awkward excuses, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to give your colleagues unpleasant moments and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a paper, stationery, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember yesterday when you put your stapler on the table, but by morning, he had a leg?
Can you find your lost pen on a colleague’s desk?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightfully be angry at you for stealing their property.
Don’t take money from office envelopes or post-it, because it can be uncomfortable if it runs out prematurely and you need it right away.
You gossip about colleagues' private lives?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tie your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy to everyone’s nose.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust.
Bury what you have heard in yourself, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know what your colleague is doing.
Are you reporting unjustified sickness?
When you call the office and report a headache because you feel unwell or feel like you’d rather rest that day, remember that your work, urgent tasks, and futures have to be done by someone else for you.
Don’t mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t be going to the office the next day, or that something may come up that will make you stay at home, let your colleagues and your boss know that you won’t be missing the next day.
Bumping, smiling, making phone calls
You're into the work, but you're being pulled out of it by the laughter of the colleagues?
Did you inadvertently hear a phone call that would have been better not to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues with bumps, singing, loud conversations (which you conduct above their heads), or with palpitations, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be distracting, even if they are not getting deeper into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If you don’t have something on time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don’t blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and someone else has a disadvantage, and eliminate it.
Ask how you can make up for your mistakes and make up for your failures.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Bear pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable outfits even if your job allows it.
Don’t be sloppy, respect your colleagues and yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes, if your job requires it, beautifully and elegantly.
If you want to meet me, you're not interesting anymore
Getting rid of the car in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio a special melody can be heard: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm going to raise the volume.
The music changes its pace and the bass arrives alongside the previous tones, and then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Zagar's "Wings of Love" is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene did not spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic's different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and even though the guitar-playing garage rock, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs and played in Yonderboi’s band until he took his own path, perhaps because two horns could not fit in a csárda.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, and pop, however, it began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
Initially playing in smaller clubs, his formations became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important domestic albums, and declared Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as the only Hungarian trendsetters that seemed to be marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the initial years in Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer’s old orchestra.
With the airy, airy reference we would be on the spot, but besides the airiness of the music, the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll – according to the spirit and trend of the time – has now emerged.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle in England, showed himself at the premiere of the album in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit, from late morning to late evening, playing popular music, mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi began to sneak into the ears with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas") recording the big arc melodies of Wings of Love.
All is well (?)
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how much layer music do you play?
Balázs Zsázer: The definition of layer music doesn’t mean too much to me.
I think there are two kinds of cassettes of popular music: not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless, and just as well be prepared for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from honest motives.
The attitude of the host also works in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has more traditions.
There are concerts not only for the thirteen-to-twenty-year-olds, but also for the older ones.
Rather, they observe the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
HVG: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be felt more in concerts, where the effect on each other is already working, but this lies only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
HVG: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He's working solo, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We’re not really following his path, even though they sometimes try to explain it in our music.
We're more like team players who trust the other person's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left his orchestra and started on another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love ranked number one in the Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi charts of mr2.
Many people heard the name Zagar for the first time.
Are you consciously opening up to a wider layer with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the album with it.
This song is about more than that.
It was intended to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to unravel the sound orgy and the harder topics that had taken place on the album.
HVG: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That’s when we came up with the idea of compiling this choir from the good-sounding soloists of our own domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enik<0xC5><0x91> [Neo], Németh Juci – was formed, which was then named Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: Is this how the song was designed or played by the girls?
Zs.B.: The song has been in the instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record material came together, we thought we needed something more for this song.
He was attracted by the chord procession to have a voice on him.
That night I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost spontaneous and frightening.
I remember it was very energized at the time, but of course I needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
No solo (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), no roles of their own, they sing completely together and are no louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
J.B.: The fact that they were standing behind was merely due to technical problems.
But we are aware that we did not want to share solo roles.
That’s what my mouth is all about, forgetting a little bit about our ego, who comes from, where it’s going, just let those wings, the wings of love, take us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoria we felt when the song was born.
Q: Which one did the most work with?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, there were harder pieces than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a race piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want the groove to work, and then slowly it all got in place, like in a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and the fact that I have already "left" the record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never the Same.
Betrayal broker risked billions because of feeling inferior
Unfaithful embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker Société Générale, named his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel has lost nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not talented at all, was rather a great player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally impaired," his superiors told the police.
However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, Kerviel’s testimony reveals that he made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion in profits from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
This opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, it was reported that there would be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages for low-income or past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe that and bet on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that they could not be revealed.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his trades.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid to find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank alone would reassure them."
Where did you get the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked for the Société Générale from 2000.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he was a brokerage assistant and became a stand-alone broker in 2005 with an annual salary of <0x24>90,000.
He knew that he would never make as much money as others.
"I knew from my first conversation in 2005 that they were looking at me with a bad eye.
Because of my education, professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigators.
Shortly after his entry, he had his first great success.
Allianz earned it thanks to its shares, betting half a billion euros on the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And this started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you look, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know, or suspect, everything.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
There was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
One weekend in mid-January, he tried to cover it up.
When he left for work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him suspicious.
“I only took four days last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to have a look at his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic wins <0x24>365 billion
The Czech Government’s ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic could obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
The amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013 is roughly half of the total.
About 125 billion SEK will be allocated to the regions out of seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will receive around 100 billion kroons from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroons, is for transport.
The Transportation Program is the largest operating program and represents 22% of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the public fund for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed by 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to acquire assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in obtaining EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan ex-president sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the country's former president, who was convicted in 2003 of <0x24>100 million (almost SEK 1.8 billion) in financial fraud.
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest in a hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be put back behind bars is still unclear, according to the AP news agency.
President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, said it would be up to the prison administration to decide whether to let Alemán's sentence be served at home or whether he should go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious corporations and their account numbers were, in reality, those of their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were subsequently spent on a foundation he founded to finance Alemán's 2001 election campaign.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget so special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This was passed last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were unable to allow a rejection.
Unlike the loud debate about distrust of the government before the vote, no drama occurred this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, albeit the most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with each heading and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the government and the opposition.
It’s more grateful to the press for doing so, which is why it gets much more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the past social-democratic governments had three shortcomings that the 2008 budget could not solve at the same time:
The first of these is the high proportion of mandatory, so-called principal spending law, which includes not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second, as a consequence of the first deficiency, is deficit farming.
The third limit is the public finance deficit, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are the budget deficits of cities and districts.
Many mayors were able to raise money from taxes, levies, and bank loans for other investments, often unwittingly issuing bonds with which their town halls were disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
There are no such sources at the moment.
To the extent that we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth for a few years now, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, the country has become increasingly indebted.
The other countries, with one exception, like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is a disgrace to the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for huge social programmes, for example, which unfortunately have grown to a gigantic size in recent years, completely unnecessarily.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate some of the senseless populist expenses approved before the elections, even if in the near future there is no pushing the retirement threshold and pension reform, any policy in this country will actually come to an end, and whoever governs it will be nothing more than bureaucracy.
With a bit of exaggeration, the majority of the taxed money from the governing politicians tends to become pensioners and mechanical distributors of social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by the expenditure of the payer.
The planned deficit of <0x24>70 billion in 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not wasted everything that was possible over the past decade.
If we do not really want to see mere officials become governing politicians, then we must be patient and wish this unfortunate coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and duties, to prepare further reform laws.
They are the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Krej<0xC4><0x8D>í
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial crisis together.
Thus, the financial markets cost more than <0x24>100 billion through the stock exchanges.
At these exchanges the interest rate is raised at the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will invest <0x24>40 billion in the stock market and make another <0x24>24 billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, national central banks have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should solve the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl, a consultant at Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl said.
Banks in the United States have lost <0x24>60 billion due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect billions of dollars in losses.
"Central banks may indeed be afraid of what could happen if they opted for such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty in accessing loans, they will lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce demand and push the US economy into recession with possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the LIBOR, the London interbank bid rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal lending, despite the fact that central banks in the US, Canada and Great Britain had cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have a similar effect to a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters news agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ move will contribute to averting the crisis, as it will not solve the underlying problem of the collapse of the U.S. real estate market.
The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken about the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made it clear that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a special mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
"The debate there is absolutely devoid of structure, it's just throwing words, which are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject was very important to him and that is why he was so committed to it.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book was also translated into German, as he said, “I often only encounter cartoons of my opinion”.
So now those interested can read the undistorted opinion.
Klaus pointed out that although he was not a climatologist, he believed he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Because he is able to monitor and evaluate professional dissertations, he is experienced in statistics and is also an economist.
The book concludes with a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and as for the warming of the planet, there is no consensus among all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and that attempts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 were unable to exchange their driving licences.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day they can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue the new driving licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, 100,000 drivers will start their journey without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the driver's license was not replaced by those who no longer wanted to drive.
While the districts represent a sharp decline in interest in driving licence exchanges, the capital’s offices have been flooded with applications for driving licence exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
You have to wait in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their driving licences.
The issuing of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
However, a new driving licence can be applied for with a shorter deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to change their driving licence by the end of the year and have a valid driving licence will face a penalty from January.
The culprit must pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police officer can also settle the violation by agreement.
In the case of administrative offences, the penalty is 2500 SEK.
Based on previous information from the City Hall, even those who do not travel anywhere can be fined.
It is said that it can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be indulgent and to impose fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said that tens of thousands of fines were not threatening anyone.
The driver's license is a document that allows people to decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should give up their license.
It is enough to take it or it is recommended to be sent by post to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 can exchange them for another three years.
Driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will only expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents involved.
Court Reduces Penalty for Berdycchel Investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, suspected of colluding with David Berdych's criminal network, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce their sentences by one year for one and two years for the other.
Investigators from the Prague Department of Organised Crime were originally threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, a review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other proceedings, he was sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
The county court found 19 people guilty of robbery in January, of which the Supreme Court has now heard 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants dismissed the allegations from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that the case was speculative.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after the agreement with Berdycc, members of the police, among other things, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped the gang avoid being held accountable.
The gang gave 30% of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment deals with the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are mainly robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of a civil servant and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because during the searches, the police found illegal guns, steel core bullets, laser sights or submachine guns.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
The gang of less than 20 members has already been legally convicted of Berdych's other robberies and many others in this case.
Other members of Berdych's surroundings testify in court, even in other proceedings, with some cases still pending before the court.
The first-instance trial has so far avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Invoice for child exchange: <0x24>12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the injured families, demands from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> a pain fee of 12 million kroner plus court expenses for the children exchanged in the maternity ward.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Veleba, basically disagrees with the proposal.
"We're refusing such a claim because it's too much," Dostál said after today's trial.
“In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion of the opponent.
We will determine whether there is any useable value at all.
But we maintain our belief that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands of people,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should range from 100,000 to 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for each month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was subject to expert criticism, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague, as the basis for the compensation negotiations.
Parents of children, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered psychological harm and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even if they encountered such rebuke that they did not prevent the change of newborns.
Women are worse at coping with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, she summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged by nurses at the maternity ward in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, the head of the district of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, handed over to the families at the end of October 100,000 kroner to cover their expenses, which were caused by the fault of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory indemnity insurance as required by law.
In the event of an error, they must reach the reserve fund and, exceptionally, may seek the assistance of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, the sums being calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Polívka lost a lawsuit for the title of the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the district court of Ostrava, although he first used the name King of Valachi, the project was developed by a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitizing on Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
In the words of the kingdom of Valachi, everyone thinks of the actor-comedian.
This view is shared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
Years later, they realized that the project was a success and they could gain something from it.
They want to live off our work," he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name King of Valachi was first used by Polívka on his television show.
It was crowned in 1993 by Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Valachian passports.
The original student prank operation turned into a business and profitable entrepreneurship, on which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of the society of the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in the passports, and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> had only used the idea, which Polívka had made public in Manassas for his business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka for the Valachi Kingdom project has certainly helped," the judge said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was the intensively engaged Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team.
The cooperation between the two parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation of Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> have accumulated, culminating in the acquittal of "the eternally elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, she took the leading role in the kingdom as the mother queen Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulakova.
In 2002, Polívka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and others filed a court action, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> could bring light to the dispute for the throne and half of the princess.
This fight should make him a new king.
The details and the date have not yet been disclosed.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the Slovak royal procession.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot Test: Disappearing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the thread are nothing special, the quality of the shift, driving and production can also be described as often below average.
But its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, is significantly better.
And the wagon called SW goes one degree further, so all I have left is to think more carefully.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the space left for the head in the rear seat.
This time the complaint is over, because the body of the wagon means that the two-metre-tall giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
Hurry in the World
I get through the interior quickly so that I don’t repeat myself often.
It’s a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, since the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
The side driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space is concerned, the increase in the size of the body is also noticeable here.
Afterwards, the few places in the head that have already been mentioned disappear.
Baggage in the trunk
The most important part of this car is its luggage.
This is very accessible (and also thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support rubbers, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, can be pulled apart and can handle heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, it is not the most sought after car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation product from mlada Boleslav, we find that Peugeot lags well behind the noticeably many 52 liters.
When it comes to vacationing abroad or placing a stroller, this value is already almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost straight floor after the second row of backrests or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder ignition engine with a capacity of 1.6 l and 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a thousand six hundred should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, low-consumption and primarily pulls.
If you compare it to your <0xC5><0xA0>koda match, which often acts as if a rag had been put into your exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
Whisper the price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder foreign engine still goes for 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
The car starts at 410,990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment at an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, rear windows with electrical remote control....
That means the car with the case and the tow costs 531,900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but count the additional equipment of the Fabia and you will get a very similar result.
So there is nothing left but a decision for the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in UK schools
The growing number of children in British schools in Eastern Europe has raised concerns among locals about the further development of the local school system.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in Northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Disputes and quarrels between students are already characterizing the relationships of parents.
In Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist insults.
The police also had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“As we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he slammed apples and pears at us and then exposed his naked butt,” the mother of the Slovak students told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the dispute over immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The aforementioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools is becoming tense between locals and immigrants.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in the UK looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond of fish.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you can find a full and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasury and transhipment place, which the Spaniards robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, and prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower buildings were built, and cars, which became a symbol of cult in the 50s of the last century, circulated on the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can sign the Bodeguita wall in Havana.
The bar of the dear National Hotel serves cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still circulate in Havana today, as the once exported hoods and your sons have long since rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although mostly the oldest part of Havana has been greatly degraded, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are becoming more and more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money so needed, its development has been given a green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, along the coast of Holguin Province, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, which is appreciated primarily by train enthusiasts.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so you can see machines working there, whose contemporaries can only be seen in museums elsewhere.
Where should we go?
Most of the best-known places in Cuba are not avoided by the majority of visitors.
So there is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that there is a museum on the aforementioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from a lime base.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, thanks to which even the decayed cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that it was there that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
It is an ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of a not so great city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, did not change much in four centuries.
Between the plains of Escambray and the sea, Trinidad is so secluded that even in the 1950s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
Nothing was built there, so they didn’t demolish it, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, it’s worth a visit to the area’s attractions, such as Playa Ancón Beach and the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
This view is certainly influenced by the road itself.
Both routes from Guantánamo to Guantánamo have to cross high and articulated mountains, passing through nature barely affected by human activity.
The eastern land bridge of Cuba has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO due to its untouched nature.
Here you can make your best chocolate, the church has the Cross of Columbus (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailing) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the Hotel El Castillo stands, you can see a few signposts, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Mestro plains, the Gulf of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of the Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion professed by the offspring of former slaves, there is much to write about.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
Afghan Allies Are Passive, Americans Say
Few soldiers and the lack of the necessary equipment are also affecting the course of the US mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, the leaders of the countries with units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination with the Allies.
While the U.S., with the help of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for more action by NATO troops this week, Britain prioritises the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is the strongest in the last five years, according to the U.S. government.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in Helmand in the south.
NATO has about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the southern regions.
However, the United States said the Allies had reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were called upon to train the Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them," <0xC5><0x99>ekli Gates said.
In the same spirit, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
“We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been debates between the participating countries over whether all allies are delivering the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in Afghanistan in relatively large numbers.
However, they were deployed in areas where there is the least violence and fighting requirements against them, so they are not as high as they are against us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan slackers have been exposed: The Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a photo of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team playing rugby in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt reaches 1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a debt of 84,000 kroons.
The total debt reached SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
However, by the beginning of December, the ministry had cut the plan by 152.8 billion kroons, thanks to better developments in the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s public debt reached SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
In June, however, it fell by 13.4 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its government debt data for the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic has more than 84,000 kronor in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
“For now, it seems that due to next year’s lower deficit, the one trillion-kroon limit could only be exceeded in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion kroons," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora said: “We will be able to cross a trillion in 2009.
The exact time depends on the next budget, which is currently unknown.
If it were proven that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, and this could be postponed until 2010.
“I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Growing debts
Government debt consists of central government debt, which is formed primarily by accumulating deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by cash receipts, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroons this year.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion by the end of September and decreased by SEK 13.7 billion from June.
The average public debt has risen to 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade with when the pension reform is here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
According to the financing strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007, the government planned to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the ministry had cut the plan by 152.8 billion kroons, thanks to better developments in the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency envisages a maximum source of 13.3 billion kroons, a reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion kroons of government bonds and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
Teacher shows up today in Khartoum court over name given to teddy bear
A court in Khartoum on Thursday night sentenced a British teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and expulsion for insulting Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, but Islam forbids any portrayal of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by flogging.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested on Sunday in her apartment. Under section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, she was accused of insulting Islam and rebellion after the students' parents repeatedly complained against her at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"The children proposed a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," said Robert Boulos, the school's director.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children voted for the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then shared a diary with the bear's photo and the inscription "My name is Muhammad."
The bear itself was not labeled with this name, but the problem is that any representation of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who taught at the same school, said that she knew him well and that she would never have done anything that would violate any religious beliefs. She said it was just an "innocent mistake": "I'm just sorry that she had the children vote for the name."
Many of the teacher's students agree with this view, saying that she is "very good at treating children" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Remember that Mohammed is the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing reverence for the Prophet (often given to the firstborn child of the family).
What are the rules for using the first name?
Can a game get that name?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
The sixth and final meeting between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the Separatist province ended without any convergence of positions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is unfortunate that the parties did not reach an agreement on the status," EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
“There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult period,” he added, stressing “the existence of obvious tensions.”
The mediation ends on December 10th.
On Monday, Serbia and Kosovo will be visited for the last time by the mediating troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Karchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and last meeting of the talks since the UN commissioned a new mediation for the troika last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who in the Security Council have already frustrated Kosovo’s independence, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
"Russia was and will remain committed to a negotiated solution and a compromise," said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under the control of the United Nations, the Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said he was ready to declare his independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in his favour.
Belgrade will continue to support greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement,” Kosovo’s independent province president Fatmir Sejdiu said in a hotel in Baden, where “last-chance talks” have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s vision of autonomy would be “a continuation of a past of murders and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a “domino effect” in an unstable region due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be taken solely by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.”
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word", adding that the unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians is based on "agreement" with Western powers.
Bush calls for Israeli-Palestinian settlement
On Tuesday, President George Bush announced at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to negotiate an immediate settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush pledged to support them in every possible way to sign the “peace treaty” before 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the “roadmap for peace” agreed in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that the aim of the talks between the Palestinian Authority under Abbas and Israel is “to sign a peace treaty that will settle all pending problems, including central issues.”
The latter address three delicate issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees who were displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict and who lived in what is now the state of Israel.
Speaking after U.S. President Abbas insisted that future talks should be “global and in-depth” and cover all areas of regulation, including “Jerusalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security.”
Olmert then pledged that future talks would be "direct and continuous" and that he would endeavour to "continue in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set out a “two-state vision” for Israel and Palestine.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
With the support of all Arab countries, Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington) initiated a plan that would guarantee peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a response in the history of the Middle East, especially because it grasps the problem at its roots and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
The prosecutor said the police were not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this kind of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of an investigation launched by the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was on patrol, so it wasn't in action. It was going at 40-50 km/h, without sirens," the police source said.
The two young people without a helmet drove at "high speed" with a green, "not officially registered, so not for use in road traffic" (see below) branded Kawasaki engine.
"Because they didn't follow the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," a policeman said.
The alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the collision by the fact that the front of the car is grooved, the windshield cracked in the form of a star, and the bumper is torn.
Pontoise's state prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said in an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning that she had commissioned the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate to investigate "neglected murder and failure to provide assistance."
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at this stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police can be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses to the accident interviewed on Sunday night confirmed “the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a strip, undoubtedly pulled by the footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were stuck together and traveled together for a while until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, rumors spread like wildfires in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers had left the scene quickly without helping the two young people.
The IGPN is cautious in this regard, but excludes that the police have made “any serious mistake.”
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation and in the course of it, greater caution," a police source said.
Libération met a witness who reported on the few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment overlooks the spot.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, immediately went down to try to resuscitate them," the witness said.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and lame.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the young people, and the fourth tried to call.”
Tensions increased among those present as the hopeless situation of the two young people became evident, so the arrival of the police took their colleagues by car from the scene.
We also know from eyewitness reports that the ambulance arrived “approximately 20 minutes after the police left.”
They used a heart massage, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help the young people.
Young people have received help.
The firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions increase in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations following the state of emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
Witnesses said about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency in Lahore, east of the country, were wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement.
In response, they threw stones at police officers, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and protests over the arrests of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and Peshawar in the northwest of the country.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has also been supported by the powerful alliance of religious parties, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, who "encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf."
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
The Court will have to declare in the coming days the legitimacy of President Musharraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army to serve as a civilian president has “been lost its validity” after the state of emergency was introduced, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musharraf had to resign from his military uniform until 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has denied rumours spread across the country that the deputy general would have appointed a place of forced residence for President Musharraf.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined) 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalizes contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unplanned pregnancies.
According to Ined, contraceptive methods such as pills and uterine spirals still fail in 5 to 6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took contraceptive pills in 1970, but now that percentage is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth person plans with a few months of accuracy and, if possible, by spring, as this is the most favorable time of year for adopting a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is essential for the station's scientific activity.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to plan it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules with tools "crafted" by astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts disconnected the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, their power supply must be ensured.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final location, generating electricity using the 17.5-ton solar panels.
Then the crew began to open the 76-metre-wide solar panels of the module.
One of the accordion-folding boards was then damaged by a jammed cable about 1 meter in length.
In order to avoid further injury, the board was not continued to be opened.
The astronauts originally had to take a check-in walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotational system. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to do the stunt by hanging the space shuttle on a 30-metre robotic arm attached to the station crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
He is tall, strong, extremely skillful, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old man had to “operate” the “damaged” solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "rails".
He was assisted in his work by another "spacewalker" who stayed near the safe passageway, as well as other astronauts inside, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick that was insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was shot out and assembled by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his associates to open the board completely, then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today, seven of the Discovery spacecraft returned to begin their planned homecoming on Wednesday.
EADS share prices are decreasing
EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defence equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2-1.4 billion.
EADS shares are currently at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 after a 4% decline.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for operating profit for 2007 due to delays in the development of the A400M engine, which apparently delayed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the tactical aircraft, announced in October, will cost “between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus,” the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS said in a statement.
Due to these expenses, EADS will have to release new figures for its 2007 operating result next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any further figures.
The Group also indicated that it had taken into account the six-month delay in preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating result decreased by 86%, largely due to delays in the development of another program, the A380, which also put a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Remains a status quo
The elections on Sunday are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, the Unified Russia.
In this, the Russians’ demand for stability, for instance, for arbitrary governance, appears after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing the voters in a televised message through public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its contents are still secret.
Putin is leading the list of candidates for the Kremlin-supporting party, the Unified Russia, which is expected to achieve a sweeping victory in the elections.
At yesterday’s reception of foreign ambassadors, the president’s behavior did not reveal anything: he only launched another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any kind of violation,” he said.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on the electorate.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, says that “such a dirty election in Russia has not occurred even in Yeltsin’s time.”
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer claims he is still unavailable to visit.
"The Russians still think of them as 'homo sovieticus'.
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who will follow Putin in the head of state?
The first round of the presidential election will be on March 2, 2008, and candidates will be able to declare their intention to run until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office can no longer be renewed.
There is no other offspring on the horizon.
What role will Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the majority in parliament, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has become a tradition.
“Russians still think like homo sovieticus: they don’t feel they can control their destiny,” said Lev Gudkov, the director of the independent Levada center.
Nikolai Koposov, a historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became Christian 500 years later than Europe, thus the development of civil society is delayed, and the traditional communal spirit has hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suitable for the people, all the more so because this new kind of paternalism was accompanied not by intimidation, but by a certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "willingly refusing personal responsibility", which quickly became apparent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of Unified Russia are led by 65 governors, who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documented the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime, became public.
The 47 million archived documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelving in Bad Arolsen in the Hesse region, could only be searched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they only provided unique and name-based access for the victims of the past or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven countries, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states have ratified the treaty, the archives were opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives will allow historians to conduct research “on the relocation of prisoners, the residents of the camps and the health status of forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making the documents public, as they contained names and therefore confidential information.
This could be, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were collected after the war for practical reasons, with the aim of searching for deported or forced labour civilians and possibly providing evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive is not considered to be of the utmost importance by some of the scientists.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade turnover is already close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion annually.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath said.
The EU foreign ministers approved last April that the European Commission should start negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India’s leading foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth most important trading partner according to the European Commission’s figures.
According to Peter Mandelson, “A free trade agreement could have a stimulating effect on both sides,” and “India could thus increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people.”
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange "products worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion" and "services worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion" each year, European Commission President Danièle Smadja and European Commission Head of Delegation Dani<0xC3><0xAB> Smadja will meet on Friday in New Delhi.

The Bank of England is offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion to the financial market for a five-week term.
The Bank of England has announced on Thursday that it is pumping <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the financial market with a base interest rate of 5.75% and a five-week maturity.
“We want to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions more securely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered on the international financial market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England said it was “ready to take further steps” to align interbank loans with the central bank’s base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate was above September 18, at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant penalty interest on sums pumped into the financial market, which has discouraged banks from using them.
According to the rumor (which is only strengthened by the development of the pound against the euro), many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refrained from discussing articles on a socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the session initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures that were adopted by the Socialist National Bureau on Tuesday, such as a 50% increase in the employment premium, a reintroduction of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel checks and restrictions on rents.
Because the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles in 180:115 votes, the sometimes sharp discussion between the ruling party and the opposition was finally interrupted just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that all proposals from his group will be resubmitted as part of an amendment to the draft amending financial law, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about C3 Presents’ new Philadelphia Music Festival, but now the company that organized and promoted the event has announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with British producer Melvin Benn’s company, Festival Republic.
"We are honored to be working with someone who is the initiator of today's American festival movement," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey will take place in the summer, so there will also be a chance to camp.
The festival will take place from August 8 to 10, on a 500-acre private estate about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
He started organizing the British Reading Festival in 1989, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palette with Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working together to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We’ve already selected the location in Philadelphia and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to host this festival in central Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We have had discussions with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
“Unfortunately, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization failed,” said Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss this with Melvin Benn, and we are now preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after demonstrating its exceptional talent as a festival organizer at the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The two events generated gross revenues of <0x24>9.8 million and <0x24>11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals took place in the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept builds on the countryside festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban feeling that is familiar in America.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population, and even the mayor himself, enthusiastically supports the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not mention the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to allow an investment in such a large event at a venue that hopefully will host the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “giant” in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but at the time of the press release, nothing is final.
“Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we’re planning a diverse selection of music so everyone can find what they like,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together form C3, which received the “Best Independent Event Organizer” award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood directors to Montreal when you have to deal with the Terminator itself.
"Seduction" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
“We need to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best location for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on which to decide for us,” says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
Denis Turcotte is currently focusing on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to showcase and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des ténèbres was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will also be screened in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also featured four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts’ opinions are divided by the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their palms and looking forward to the usual year-end run.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “statistically speaking, the stock market is generally behaving positively in December.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily accurate and, in fact, in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term."
Experts are far from advocating a boom in the stock market at the end of the year, although they state that "the stock market is sustained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity to invest because of the lack of guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed returns, which are negatively affected by the long-term as well as short-term escape to quality securities".
As a result, the stock market will be characterized by a more lateral, volatile movement, “especially as the impact of the Fed’s interest rate cut is not yet known, as the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are threatened.”
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees, which means it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not at all rosy.”
Ibex’s loss is nearly 4% of the highest recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so pessimistic.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets and contributions to the normal pension fund at that time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitutional Festival.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility will affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, “we are close to the technical level and are experiencing a downturn in the stock market index, which may also increase in terms of news from the U.S. in terms of the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
Analysts are confident that this will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on which securities will be targeted to reach Ibex’s new maximum quotas.
Mr Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "this year it is up to the big securities".
The expert would add the two major banks and a few construction companies to the list, “because by then the electricity industry will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of the Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking and industrial sectors.
Rallying can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if there is any.
“ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow along this path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main factor for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the representation in the Spanish market is not very high in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two fall in December.
The real rally at the end of the year was observed in 2003, when the stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the burst of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 adjusted down by 28.17 percent, a jump of 6.68 percent was recorded in December.
So it remains open whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (at the moment Ibex is showing an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally could take place.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a 12-hour account Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group to have branches that are normally open from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and even on Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
The unions have recently agreed to close 75% of their branches in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will be used to decide whether to join the initiative to promote better business opening times.
This is the goal of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses that shop in these places.
The bank wants to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the opening hours already mentioned, as this is not a new opening hours, but a modification of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment, but requires more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which even accommodate meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero said the experience was positive.
Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also have very favorable opening hours, opening even on Sundays and public holidays.
The aforementioned units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles the stock market value of its rival, Antena 3
"We did it."
This is the sentence used to express satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when Telecinco’s advisor, Paolo Vasile, revealed that the television station he runs has doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
But one thing overshadowed his joy: “The only thing that hurts is that it’s not because we climbed more, but because we fell less,” he said.
Even so, he emphasized that in a weak market, "we fell less".
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
Mediaset owns 52 percent of the company and Vocento owns 13 percent, making it worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has been down 40.5% since January, so it was half as much as 2,193.46 million yesterday.
The other listed communications companies have a value of 3.571 million for Sogecable, 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to similarities between the two companies.
The question is how much we can deliver in the same market, at what cost, and how it will pay off in terms of audiences.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to become the first television channel this year with gross advertising revenues exceeding <0x24>1 billion, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, a subsidiary of the group that manages advertising.
If the announcement is true, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in the current financial year, compared to the <0x24>965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006.
Antena 3’s net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (up 734.4 million), while television’s net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
Analysts say one of the factors that triggered Telecinco’s stock market dynamism was the high payout that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company, headed by President Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate may change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company, Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payout of 50%, although we have always given out a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be happy with us this year, as we have already favoured them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterized by some slump.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its return estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
According to them, this is due to an estimated decrease in sales growth from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company predicts that Antena 3’s profits will decline by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1 .
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high profitability and long-term sustainable potential of dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: it sees Telecinco as more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retention) due to its "multi-attractiveness" and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweighting due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves adoption of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallel to the parliamentary process, which ended today with a congressional vote approving the Senate’s amendments, the government initiated a social dialogue on the underlying legislation so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of the MEPs and Senators in negotiating and concluding agreements aimed at establishing the most favourable legal framework for the protection of investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of companies, in order to ensure efficient market operation.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, will allow for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, expanding the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new Directive will allow financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, and create a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory firms (AFIs), in addition to securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems capable of executing transactions involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalization systems executing orders that compete with current stock market participants.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the defining aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management, and to keep records of all transactions carried out in order to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Commission has filed a number of amendments. Among these, it is of the utmost importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds, due to the high risk to investors. This has been proven in connection with US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, all this 30 years after the Royal Decree defining the professional functions that can only be performed by economists came into force in 1977.
The Senate, in turn, proposed the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as a broker agent who works for someone else’s account, does not need the CNMV’s license, and can distribute products to multiple investment companies or gain customers at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account in calculating the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with Eurostat’s and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that are comparable with data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method is different for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore differ from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, vice-president of the government and Minister of Economic Affairs, said the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only “temporary”, but at the same time predicted that the price index would be expected to remain “relatively high” in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable, the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less at the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November was “less surprising” than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economic Affairs admitted in connection with the data released today.
With Northern Rock, Virgin wants to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently amount to just <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the National Bank of England.
At the time, it still held a record number of deposits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, despite the government’s promise of a 100 percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial trading name, Virgin Money. Virgin will need to earn about a quarter of the British banks’ revenues over the next three years in order to acquire the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion and thus reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group, known for his popular advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach his goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin consortium's offer as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. Alongside Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, in the province of Murcia, on suspicion of being involved in a city corruption scandal this week.
In addition to him, one of the City Hall secretaries and the police chief of the settlement were arrested.
Former member of the city council José Martínez Andreo took the place of the EPP MEP Juan Morales in May, who, according to official bodies interviewed by the radio station SER, may have been the head of the corruption network.
Police are continuing to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested while leaving Morales with corruption-related documents in his bag.
According to police sources, the investigation is about the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the presidency of the Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE’s Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to hold the presidency of the parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE’s Organizational Secretary José Blanci and confirmed by Bono himself at the party’s federal headquarters today at noon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his choice for the former minister by saying that “we have to count on the best” in politics and that Bono “is among the best”.
In addition, he added that "probably" the Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of the Parliament if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current Parliamentary President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run in the next elections and would rather fight against climate change in the scientific community by giving up his political career.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he left active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy if the Socialists win, the party also wanted to inform them about who will be the president of the parliament “in the spirit of transparency”.
If Bono is indeed to fill the post, he would like the Parliament to be “a place of respect rather than insult or shouting” and more like a citizen’s home.
“Once in a while, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk calmly, and the speech of the Prime Minister has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he commended the current president Manuel Marín for his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president already, so that his opponents would not regard him as "supervised".
Campaign for Climate
Because the movement for climate change is ruthlessly persecuting both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must also side with a political leader such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and proclaims that “we need to make a new deal with our Earth”.
This comment, however, raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain’s leading position within the EU in failing to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not tried to avoid it?
It should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits the population will have to change, what kind of energy savings at individual and social levels should we expect, and what will the economic consequences be?
So who has to make sacrifices and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not received, nor will we receive, an explanation for these questions.
This is because it is about sacrifice and money.
Measures brought about by climate change, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and costly for both companies and the general public.
Even the PSOE’s increase in gas prices would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly retracted it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, empty slogans with no real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, he does not demand, he does not attack, he even beautifies the election meetings and awakens tenderness in us.

Totana Mayor and Chief of Police Arrested for Alleged Corruption
The Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in the province of Murca, the EPP-led José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the City Hall secretary and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources have informed today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the local authority responsible for managing industrial estates and dwellings.
The three arrests were preceded on Monday by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as land to be built in order to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying executives commissions during their previous mandate.
Two others have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the Court of Totana.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
Former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigeria (Pontevedra), along with Pablo José M.G., director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, which also belongs to the Nuaria Group and through which the bribes were carried out.
The investigation is carried out by a group of police officers responsible for local-level crimes, whose members, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 searches, mainly at companies related to the detainees, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who could have mediated the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential complex in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified, and the project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate agent, Conycase, which manages the parking lots in Coruna, Venezuela and the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Hogartel, which specialises in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which sells, promotes and installs building components.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world’s level of culture), in reference to the Helsingin Sanomat, which was published on November 18th at the same time as the critique of Blackburn’s book.
“Philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The murderer, a high school student, quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Educational Adviser Pekka Elo, responsible for teaching philosophy, on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat, demanded that teachers look critically at Plato’s teachings, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy classes in secondary schools.”

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains an offence related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a felony and can be punished for six months to one year.
However, stealing a disc worth less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you are stealing in a store for a value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000, the theft is a crime, but its penalty is still below the penalty for downloading on the Internet (Art. 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but return it after 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading it on the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass fight, you can be fined from three months to one year (Article 154 of the Code), but you can be fined from six months to two years for copying a CD.
(Art. 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author’s consent is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

I got an article from my doctor about strange research titled, “Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it.”
That is, the feelings of employees on the payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn, using magnetic resonance tomographs, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
The author of the study, Bernd Weber, head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly and the partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if they both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money rewards, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double the amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to reach such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
Her term expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste, as the perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on a list that Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach has chosen as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film, like a real crime scene, follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as she tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to close the loop around the fugitive criminals.
What kind of insurance suits me?
Car insurance, which means security for the owner of the car against various damages, involves a significant expense and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and nature of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what type of car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what this is all about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract stating that the insurance company undertakes to compensate against a fixed premium in the event of the occurrence of the damage.
In practice, the premium is the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and more.
Insurance companies calculate the premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. those who have a higher risk of accidents pay a higher amount.
That’s why people over the age of 25, or women, pay less, because statistics show that they are less risky because they are more cautious.
Similarly, insurance companies have concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
Frequency is crucial for the type of car used.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
Many factors are taken into account by insurance companies when determining the premium.
Therefore, the owner should look carefully to choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in the choice, so that you can best adapt to the needs of the insured and create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 will have to face a number of drawbacks, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of the driving license.
Although it is ideal to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out full insurance on their own, so they will be insured against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of self-sufficiency that an insured person must pay depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-sufficiency,” says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, an online insurance broker in Spain.
Another option is third party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
Here's some advice.
If you are under the age of 25, be careful and avoid accidents, as this will affect the bonus and you can reduce the amount you pay in the future.
Bonuses are defined as discounts granted compared to the basic tariff of the insurance company.
The penalty imposed compared to the basic tariff is called malus.
The amount of bonus and malus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus rate,” explains Noguera.
Once the age of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out appropriate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
We recommend that you take out a full insurance policy.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in an accident, or even when driving," says the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already gone beyond the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but does not yet have children, it is best to take out a full insurance policy, of course, provided that his or her financial possibilities allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so in their case, the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance with part of yourself (this can reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300), or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend the insurance from the third year of the car to cover damage caused to others.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share of themselves," says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend full insurance with a part of yourself (which is around 150 euros) or, in case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it provides protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it represents a high cost, so it is essential to choose the right form of personalized insurance.
The Celtic wants to score points in Milan to make it to the eighth-finals.
Milan and Celtic will join forces at San Siro stadium on Tuesday to score the missing points at the Champions League closing ceremony. The Italians will be first and the Scots will qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round they secured the pass with a draw against Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but it would take one more to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will be battling the four-point Benfica, from overtaking him.
Group D’s two games will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championships, where he will try to qualify for the 16th final in the semi-finals on the 13th.
This brings Group D to a close sooner than the rest, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza will be a tie, the two teams are aiming for victory, as the Italians do not want to miss home, and the Celtic will be the first to take a better place in the eighth-finals.
Even defeating Gordon Strachan is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure, because if there's a scoring match, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next match (2-0), will continue.
The Italians will try to grieve the Scottish evening, who would like to qualify for the reorganized Champions League eight-finals twice in a row, after having just lost a goal to Kaka in a 0-0 prolongation (1-0) in the previous season.
Shakhtar would be happiest to win the "Rossonerik" because if they lose, the Celtic will be in the eighth-finals and remain in the UEFA.
As Benfica, despite being in the last place at the moment and having no chance of remaining in the European championship, can still get third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the Spice Girls’ first concert.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, and have performed in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver.
Approximately 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, where a video of the band’s history was shown in the 1990s.
With the reunion and touring, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls are wearing a bracelet from the husband of the "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowded auditorium at GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
At the announcement of the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star “hasn’t seen our dress yet, so I’m nervous about what she’ll think of the performance.”
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
I thought, "Why not?" Now I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said about the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that in the meantime, “things have settled and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV, the band arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines private jet.
At the airport, a group of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
There is a renewed gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Much of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is channelled through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations are always receiving great attention.
Kiev said that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also inflict higher transit costs on Russia.
As a result of a previous dispute between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries fell.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is about an attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, to reach an agreement on the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will have to implement a 50% increase in gas production from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in line with one of the most important gas transit countries during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the last major gas price dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom shut down the gas duct to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed prices upwards.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will supplement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS is "compulsory to monitor foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was brought forward by chief accountant Robert Black after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to an attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of its overseas employees.
At the same time, his report, through a sample of five health authorities, also pointed out key checks that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the chief auditor checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors charged with attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom in October via video contact with the Old Bailey court.
In the case of their employees from overseas countries, the NHS committees must verify the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and their availability of the necessary permits to work in the United Kingdom before they take up employment.
Although Scottish health committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor suggested, among other things, that the committees should introduce a guide to the Criminal Records Office, which would facilitate the verification process for employers with different overseas countries.
"While we have found evidence of such checks in the records of staff, they are not being carried out regularly," the report said.
According to Black, while the Scottish NHS is performing its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: “Our report highlights areas of the system that can be improved in order to keep up-to-date information on the number of NHS staff from overseas.”
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could help us identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"According to the report, the current pre-employment checks are working well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals made is not yet transparent," he said.
According to Scottish health authorities, their current number of overseas employees, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the main auditor pointed out that the figures were likely to be higher, partly because the committees had problems identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the inspection procedures put in place in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and the NHS authorities in Lothian operate to a large extent in a coordinated manner.
These procedures included the verification of passports, work permits and evidence of professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining a directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was delighted that this task was carried out after the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the recommendations in the report and ensure that the updated guide on pre-employment checks for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. An updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division at the awards ceremony
"Control", a biopic of Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis, swept five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The award was also given to the main character Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis, as well as director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebbell.
The award for Best Actress went to Dame Judi Dench for the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety Award was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for putting the British film in the international spotlight.
The awards were given during a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" depicts the rise of Curtis within the Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black and white film, featuring "The Killers", "David Bowie" and "New Order on the Soundtrack", cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who was previously known for making the cover of U2's "Joshua Tree" album, was nevertheless enriched with two awards: Best Director and Best Starting Director.
Another award-winner at the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, the mafia boss of Killer Promises.
Famous for his roles as a tough guy, Ray Winstone was awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose names include "Scum", "Éhkoppon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently filming "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after Harris, the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter", who died in 2002.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door,” Winstone said.
“I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
“Richard Harris’ style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time and I really appreciate him.”
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Supporters and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People in Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants involved in terrorist cells who were planning to carry out an upcoming attack on an oil facility and several attacks on ecclesiastical personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign resident is planning to launch an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province.
After a 2006 attack on the world’s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq, organized by Al Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began to build a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect the facilities.
According to the report, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a “specialist in rocket launches” who has crossed the border illegally.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom's territory.
Twenty-two of the detainees had plans to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to stop the Saudis who are joining Al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, fighting against the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is regarded by the Saudi hardline Sunni as a heretic.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant number of Saudi Arabian ecclesiastical leaders as being involved by the authorities in supporting the policy of the ruling royal family.
The group's fighters, inspired by the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's call for a pro-Western Saudi government, aimed at attacking foreign-resident settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“Security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past...five months,” a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-strong "media cell" was captured with the aim of spreading "Takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violent actions against Muslims stigmatized as unfaithful and apostate.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of financial support for the militants.
Venus Climate Could Provide a Perspective of Earth's Future
Scientists found yesterday that Venus was once a place for pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is much more likely to be considered a whimsical twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets are almost the same in size and orbit, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to what scientists know today, billions of years ago, Venus may have had very similar living conditions and habitable conditions.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the planet's lower rotational velocity, Venus has entered a radically different trajectory.
Today, water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year of study of the planet, provide a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, Professor of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Begin to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar in structure.
“Our new data has made it possible to develop a scenario of the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it may have had habitable conditions like Earth.
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material – reportedly enriched uranium – was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Widely open doors
Mitt Romney says he is not worthy of a presidential candidate answering questions from a snowman.
Republican candidates for the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube where ordinary voters recorded their questions and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday night, November 28, turned out to be as ridiculous as the Snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
The questions and answers, however, this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known exactly how CNN’s production managers, who co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube videos presented to the candidates.
The longest part of the first half-hour of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' cheeks.
CNN has asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if they hear a promising thing: the mediator experienced outstanding consensus when candidates made tough statements about borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, a national leader, and Romney, a frontrunner in the decisive primarys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change his perception that he handled the issue of illegal immigration too frivolously during his mayorship in New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The word battle between the two became particularly heated when the questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would guarantee illegal immigrants permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, have managed to get deeper into the subject.
And although none of them is considered a candidate for the nomination, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they began to ring the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: the common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of toxic toys in China and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became rather unpleasant.
Giuliani was faced with the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney questioned whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
On this subject, Giuliani stumbled and eventually clung to the view that, although he considered the Bible as his favorite book, he might not literally interpret the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the Iowa election just now, thanks to his steadfast Christian conservatism, reacted to expectations that the death penalty was painful but needed.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for election.
The competition is unusually open.
Huckabee’s thrilling rise in Iowa coincides with the fundraising action of libertarian Ron Paul and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet succeeded in launching a joint candidate from among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who timelyly and convincingly shouted the victory message of America’s greatness, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are unpredictable for the time being.
Workers' Pain
Another abyss opens in front of Gordon Brown; the exit route remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one does not seem too picky.
No one sold his honor, no politician found his hotel bills in Paris, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, for more than four years, made a disguised contribution of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million) to the Labour Party in Britain, and that the party did not report on this, is one of the things that the surrounded Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the prime minister got away with the election, and when his statement that the polls had not influenced the outcome of the decision, he thoughtlessly questioned the British intellectual capacity, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, remarked with increasingly ingenious remarks, he turned from the once feared Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The mistake in saving the impoverished bank Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment in the crossfire.
The morbid proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to work together against the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an unimaginable level of administrative clumsiness.
Three retired generals in the House of Lords incited a riot, protesting a reduction in the army budget, declaring that the position of Defense Minister was a part-time occupation.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary general of the Labour Party (formerly the administrative head), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean that Brown won't be able to turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach a point where control becomes impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is highly unfit to move things forward, and perhaps not to remain in his position for a long time, the suspended incredulity is over: the civil servants’ faculty begins to leak, the cabinet ministers go to briefings, the press is looking for bad news; and the government starts to defensively and is unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position, because unlike other political leaders, he is not considered a "fresh blood."
As much as he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made during his time as Finance Minister.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair’s missteps, such as the protracted investigation of the relationship between the “nobility for money” affair and political party funding, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown’s situation is indeed unpleasant, it is not as embarrassing as it seems.
Mistakes committed are not as frightening as they appear to be.
Like Mr. Bean, no one was killed, no one was tricked directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful it may be, can be the creation of the trends that Stalin in Brown has always promised: a reliable, solid and somewhat hard-handed government.
A good example is the hustle and bustle of political donations.
Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said he did not want to reveal his good deeds to the public.
Perhaps so, but the decision was not within his competence.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who is knocking at the gates of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who said he was aware of Abrahams’ action but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations, as will Jon Medleson, the head of the Labour Foundation, who learned of the confused donations in October.
However, there are no ties to Brown for the time being: there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these twists, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has accomplished half of his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, his firmness was diluted by his use of a familiar instrument; in investigating the matter, he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the "learning lesson" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are competent.
Brown also has other things to do, such as appointing the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules that has been running for six months without a leader, or pushing ahead with an effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-hat Labour Party to work with the Tori and break with the special financial ties associated with the associations - a tough deal for party-loyal Brown.
But you have to face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading with a major advantage; Brown has two years to reclaim voters behind him; the only way to achieve victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
If there is blood in the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weak, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose up to <0x24>99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-off rate for outstanding loans and the default rate for late payments over 30 days increased.
Last month, HSBC reported a loss of <0x24>1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer finance segment, in part due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, panic is premature.
The ratio of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by Moody's for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decline in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the US insolvency rules in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency whistleblowers, but also in large losses in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, whether the total borrowing conditions deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit repayments of consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are adding debt to their credit cards to pay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor cash flows rather than asset value, so a fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors can also benefit from the situation.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, consumers are less inclined to repay the loan; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards moves forward in priority.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions more quickly and flexibly than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-pricing of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to a complete revaluation of loans,” says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual recession is much higher.
If the fall in housing prices and the fall in lending drive America into a recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a harsh future.
It is worth paying attention to those predators.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
On Wednesday, three British bankers have confessed to having been tried for their role in the fraud against Enron’s former CFO Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent of the seven-fold fraud allegation, alleging they had collaborated with Fastow in a secret scam committed in 2000 to get rich at the expense of their employer.
The trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of a single fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division became known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into the Enron crash in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers named the "NatWest Triple" were charged with traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare for the scam, along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, then Fastow's right hand.
Fastow, responsible for planning numerous frauds that put Enron into bankruptcy, also held control of the Enron subsidiary that Greenwich NatWest invested in.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's <0x24>1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 to acquire a stake in the company.
Fastow is accused of falsely informing Enron that the energy company is acquiring a <0x24>20 million subsidiary stake from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the <0x24>20 million hit the heels of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received <0x24>7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty on two counts for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a texarkana prison.
The three men were allowed to travel to the United States for a <0x24>1 million bail per person, where they would be staying during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after the accounting tricks used for years could no longer cover up the millions of accumulated debts and the companies that were seen as profitable but actually loss-making.
Thousands of jobs have been lost, market value has fallen by more than <0x24>60 billion and pension funds by more than <0x24>2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year for his involvement in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay ceased with the man’s death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
At <0x24>54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine will take the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles with a single tank.
But for some rich Russians, this amount is merely a small amount of money.
"It can accommodate 18 passengers," said Dan Firer of Gulfstream.
"But no one puts so many seats in it because the machines are bought for private families or company managers."
Mr. Firer expected visitors to attend the exclusive four-day Millionaires Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers have rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that Russian new-rich people will be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-covered chiller grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer watched carefully the shiny orange Porsche exhibited at the booth next to him.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s not worth our products,” he said.
Russia has the largest market for private aircraft after the United States.
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money as Dallas did at the time of the oil spike.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when a few American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialistic here," said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Japanese gamblers of the 1970s and 1990s in Saudi Arabia, the Russians have now become the world’s most spectacular spender.
The most exclusive luxury brands are claiming their share of the gold rush.
At a conference organised by the luxury industry at another site in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products on markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to the Forbes list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billion people with a total of <0x24>282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, with a total of <0x24>670 billion, according to a study by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, which analysed personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, the number of people living below the minimum living standards in Russia was 15.8 per cent in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all well-groomed, and men are a treasure trove."
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, who wandered through the halls on Sunday evening in evening dresses, attributed themselves and their clients to a millionaire.
"I've been looking at the cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was rudely hurrying around in her uniquely designed outfit, as if she was used to this mess.
The fair was organized primarily for the newly-rich, brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to walk around a draughty, cipherically decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, plads and apartments in Dubai.
For the average person, the admission ticket costs <0x24>30 (<0x24>44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a seat at the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, as opposed to a wall-sized, hand-decorated Rembrandt imitation painted on blue tiles.
"The Russians are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the Russians, who had been rich for a long time (according to Russian standards, that means 10-15 years), had already switched from blatant logos to brands with limited numbers of bagatelles that would not be able to enter a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire patrons and tourists, filled the place every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil Beds, said that he sold two <0x24>70,000 worth of silk, cashmere and cotton woven mattresses.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto sales associate for supplying high-end cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for <0x24>170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of the luxury car manufacturer L.A. Connection, sold three Rolls-Royce Phantom grilles on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble connected chain bracelets and cost <0x24>55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for the owner of a Russian casino, which Swarovski said he covered with crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four is <0x24>22,000.
“A Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather or a picture of his wife’s face made of a zirconium cube will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapetian said.
Instead, he'll keep them in his garage guarding 30-40 cars.
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, according to Karapetian, the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege these days, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is now likely to be a millionaire, if not in money, at least on paper,” he said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires may at least have made the appearance of wealth in front of the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were piled up with millions of fake dollars in banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit notes for the Millionaires' Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many had their mobile phones take pictures of themselves while they were struggling with money, or simply putting a few million dollars in their pockets.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical fault suspected behind death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out of the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop in Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly thereafter, a police car arrived.
Then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"I knew then that someone had died."
Authorities have found out that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo, who previously worked as a senior assistant to the Newark Police Director.
An investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon working on West Scott Avenue 212 and not identified by the police.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has sorely affected high-ranking Newark police officers.
Arroyo, whose voice was well-known in the department, has been an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and trustworthy," McCarthy said in a phone interview with Arroyo on Wednesday.
". He was my guardian.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Mrs Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who is now working on the Committee on the Control of Alcoholics Products, leaving behind two sons, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the investigators were working to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorized surgeon.
"There's a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
According to official reports, they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
The 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and police have so far revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro had been heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study were investigating whether part of the house functioned as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door in Castro’s home, where a rotten rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, in the car entrance stood a blue tank with the inscription "Ethyl Vanilin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume.
From the hooks two mountain bikes hung sideways.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in helping her navigate the unusual and unfinished political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'Watch this and that!'" he recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations of the Fed’s interest rate cuts lead to a rush in global stock markets
Stock prices jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the reassuring statements of the deputy president of the Central Bank of America raised hopes that the Fed would try to ease investment opportunities by further cuts in interest rates.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have sprung up after Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of Fed president Ben Bernanke, said managers had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of calming markets amidst the signs of a recurring credit crisis, he said that the current turmoil “partly pushed back the progress made in the market at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as saying that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets or even further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements have also reassured Wall Street, which has recently received a number of bad news for the US economy, such as the negative record for the number of house sales in the US.
The side effect of the financial turmoil was reinforced by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would be dismissing 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce as part of the cost cut to offset losses in the U.S. second-market mortgage sector.
A total of 20 jobs in the 1,500 employees’ headquarters in London will be affected by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306,2 points, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The turmoil in the credit market erupted after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) brought three-month maturity papers to European banks at a price of 4.7%, unprecedented since April 2001.
After the British interbank rate, the Libor, reached its highest rate since September, at 6.59 percent, after a steady increase since November 12, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB, and to release additional capital to the London financial market.
England demands decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the English team six in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision.
The latter issue is relevant on the one hand because David Graveney, the chairman of the Selection Board, who temporarily performs this particular task, assists head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in making the decision, and on the other hand because the desk of the English executive director Hugh Morris is beginning to fill with requests for a national or at least one-off selection position.
The shortest of the two players is the one who does not get the sixth place, but as is known, life, and especially sport, is often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell why someone reaches the peak of their vocation while others can’t get past even a lower level. Often it depends more on luck than on talent.
It is not only cricket that is difficult to choose, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair for Shah if this happens?
The same question could arise in other areas of life, for example, if, say, John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated, business-savvy young leaders, were put before decision-makers, while only one of them would have room for them.
Who can tell which level a cricket player is suitable for without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data greatly influences the decision, but opportunities are equally important.
In a team, a player must catch the captain's eye at the right moment in the cricket gate, and a batter must regularly get a chance if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
For example, James Anderson has played better in the last season, but he is sure to be a team member in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison’s own statement that he is in good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson won the tour with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only scored 29, but they both have had successes at the highest level, and they hope to continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided based on their opinions.
This decision may upswing or break anyone’s career, but it may also have no particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played all the tests and scored well with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was the then-emergent Paul Collingwood who became an outstanding and decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated, despite having scored double one hundred points in Australia against the Australians.
It is likely that in their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, listening to their conservative instincts, will vote in favor of Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah’s bright and successful debut in the quarters of the ’88 Bombay test, compared to Bopara’s seven-year-old, 22-year-old six, who also scored 32 first-class points in twisted shots.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran in two quarters against the West Indies in the Lorda test at home in May, and the fact that Vaughan struggling to play again in the next game faced immediate resistance from the selectors, seems to have reduced the stamina he had in Bombay.
Contrary to him, Essex’s universal talent is a life-joyful and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to annoy him on the cricket field, but his behavior outside the field was well characterized when he overturned at an exhibition with a four-wheeled car from the team's sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did afterwards was to pick up Vodafone's (of course sponsored) phone and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better player at the edge of the field. With his sliding mid-steps, he develops an advantageous throwing angle, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance right now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would give a great deal if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one who played this weekend.
They take buses to bring refugees home to work and fight Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad have been arriving with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or visas, or who are hoping that order in the city will be restored.
Some of them have come back to fight the soldiers who have driven them out of their houses.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people, loaded with dozens of buses, arrived from Damascus.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi said.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"It is said that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to Moqtada al-Sadr militia minister who is currently stopping his Shia army.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from Amaryah, a predominantly Sunni-inhabited town, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and the regime prevented Iraqis from taking jobs.
Amarijai's Shia neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-backed troops, they were able to push Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader fleeing a grenade attack at his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many have said that the peace that has strengthened in the capital since the invasion of the US forces and that they have been lured home by the armed civilian forces that have cooperated with the Americans.
However, even more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa-related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, who had three children, expressed a widespread view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to reject refugees’ visa applications to force them to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people escaped from the death squads operating in the country.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis in order to get them back home,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I ran away.”
One of the reasons for the alleviation of violence is that the Sunni people were driven out of the Shia areas, while the Shia people also left the Sunni-inhabited areas.
Many fear that the sudden arrival of refugees will again upset the mood, which could even lead to further fights.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training, and its higher education is internationally oriented.
In just one training area, Saarlanders face the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the fiftieth time, I explained to a person outside the Saarland that we are not French," this is the self-ironic slogan on the posters of the smallest federal state on its 50th anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which boasts the fifth place according to surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions – even for the sake of tradition – work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high by 15.6%.
However, the colleges and universities of the Saar region are also above-average attractive for those wishing to study in the Saar region - many of them do not have a high school degree.
“In the Saarland, the opportunities for vocational training are being exploited,” explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than one-fifth of young people are entitled to further education in vocational schools, which puts the Saarland region above the federal average by more than seven per cent.
The combination of vocational and higher education is well-designed.
Infrastructure for dual studies ranks second in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practice-oriented training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Saaremaa Ministry of Education has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Pisa study," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said in a statement.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
So that children can start learning earlier, the last kindergarten year is free of charge. This is a model that in the meantime has also begun to be copied by other federal states.
Whether pupils’ performance will improve sustainably will only be answered by future comparative studies.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk has shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland did not improve to the same extent as that of the other federal states.
The Bavarians count better.
To the Saarlanders’ greatest disappointment, the Pisa survey does not take into account foreign language skills – otherwise, they would be rewarded in this area.
because the language of neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez resets the clocks
In the near future, hours in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will rewind the timers in Latin America by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez was ridiculed.
According to the official newspaper of Venezuela, the clocks will be reversed by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. leader, Chávez, argued that full-hour time zones were imposed on the world by the United States.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighbouring Colombia would be severed due to a hostage attack.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not be in contact with either the president or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this for my own dignity," Chávez said, calling for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to give their opinions in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly increase its power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of the hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe's decision "spotted" Venezuela on his face, giving a voice to Chávez's criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone called “Por que no te callas” is a phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people.
The sentence comes from János Károly, King of Spain, who at the last Latin America summit was so upset by the constant yellings of the populist politician from Balolda that he cut into the word.
Germans face pay cuts in 2007
Real wages threaten German workers this year, despite strong economic activity.
Experts have substantiated their pessimistic predictions.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually expect less salaries in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is modest wage development, an increase in the VAT and a rapid rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economics.
Employees may also be burdened with unemployment insurance.
In a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung", Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said that in the current situation it is right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply for loans or subsidies to the federation, the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
Compared to the previous year, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is the evil twin of Earth.
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: In its atmosphere, the European spacecraft Venus Express has detected lightning strikes and wind turbulences in its polar orbits, such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that it is lightning on Venus.
The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has provided evidence - electromagnetic waves have been detected at the periphery of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at an altitude of approximately 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, on the columns of the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "early soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was triggered by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early days," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington, D.C.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is roughly a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it's still her twin," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different path of evolution.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus exploration because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way specifically to this planet.
The latest findings, already presented in several "Nature" articles, are not only proof of the uniqueness of Venus within the Solar System.
"They also suggest that the neighboring planet has a greater resemblance to Earth than we initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the known Arctic whirlwind, researchers have also discovered an even faster-moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The solar system's second innermost planet has almost the same mass as Earth, and its 12,100-kilometre diameter is almost the same size as Earth.
The star, also known as the Morning Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus’ surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under exactly the same conditions.
Both had water accumulate, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus it forms a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
German President Köhler has called for the end of a party dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the reception in September.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this matter, we should not appear to the outside world as a divided nation,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures,” Köhler stressed.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the foreign policy balance, the president stressed; however, Merkel is defending herself against the accusation that the chancellor is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken up with the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is aware of this,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier indirectly disliked the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "showcase policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, there were severe disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign ministries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to accept a Tibetan religious leader as an official by European politicians, Wen Jiabao said.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed to an attempt to tear Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like those in France
Street clashes with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not end up in street violence, the Federal Interior Minister said.
Barricades burned, rifles fired at police officers: After severe unrest among young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful that social explosives do not accumulate in our homes and do not end up in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problem cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already being seen.”
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that German suburbs do not have such urban and sociological problems as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting serious street fights with police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were on fire in Toulouse.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded more integration from the federal government.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Yet action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is “higher than average”.
Above all, more educational space should be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide a perspective for young people.”
The head of the Turkish community, however, added that “social supervision within the family” is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "However, we must be on guard."
Young people should be given the opportunity to work and be educated as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete tranquility during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, and a helicopter was scanning the area with a headlight.
Competent authorities reported three arrests and some burning garbage dumps and cars.
Since the reporting, a security unit of around 1,000 people has provided peace of mind.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after her visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
The following night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The incident was caused by a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
The first findings of the State Prosecutor’s Office show that the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
The Skywalker in Angela 's Empire
The chancellor's unrealistic actions are proof that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing can be expected of him either.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
Following the bleak, indifferent and meaningless action of the Bundestag in its general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country whose governance would be his responsibility.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he merely expressed that he did not want to understand what those who criticized him were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches were.
At the same time, there was no particular interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela the Cloudman appeared: a politician who fled away from reality into foreign politics, and there she is only insecure.
An example of climate protection: He is unrestrainedly praising himself for the Heiligendamm Resolutions, but is silent about how to achieve the country’s climate change targets.
As far as self-respect is concerned, two years ago the CDU president would not have allowed such modesty.
Now he clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This damages his reputation as a pragmatic person who solves problems rather than words.
In Angela’s cloudy realm, however, domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
This is only a few half-words.
In this respect, it is telling how often you stumble in the language when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel will have to swing three times to make a half-healthy sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he's stumbling in a foreign territory.
Attack Division
In the debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard-hit – now they have to fear an outside candidate.
The tensions of the candidates have already surfaced on the first issue.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York “a refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Who, for his part, contradicts with grave facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants," Giuliani replies, and vomits in the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he employed undocumented immigrants as private individuals.
Candidates are on the move: As the Republican camp still lacks a single-backed favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN above all to undermine their opponent’s credibility.
30-second videos submitted by internet users via YouTube are little more than short summaries.
"We have brought Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism," says John McCain, who is the only one in the circle who demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam veteran when he is reluctant to condemn as torture the so-called “Waterboarding,” a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
The fact that the campaign’s important topics are, in the meantime, beyond Iraq and the debate on torture, is reflected in the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
A loud applause breaks out in the hall in praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for having voted for an abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, shudders when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf to rule as a civilian for the first time
The day after his resignation, Musharraf was sworn in as President of Pakistan.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and so succumbed to international pressure, above all from the United States.
Eight years after the assassination of the former general in the form of a military coup, he now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf’s resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
Prosecutor-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would lift the state of emergency shortly after his pledge, fulfilling a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, in which Musharraf had sent lawyers sympathetic to him in early November following the declaration of the state of emergency, rejected all protests over the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal area of North Vaziristan killed five soldiers and injured four others.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road close to the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The German supergroup of the 1970s is playing again: Three members of the Harmonia gang have dusted their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the reassembly, a clip of their high-end "Live 1974" is released.
At that time, they were much more known abroad.
The announced sensation takes the form of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
In front of each of them is his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is 63 years old in a snow-white shirt.
From the left, the 57-year-old Michael Rother is accompanied by a laptop and a guitar.
From the right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is bent and focused on the console.
Each of them makes a noise, and at the same time a rhythm.
Sometimes it just happens to be traditional music.
However, all of this does not seem to bother the masters themselves.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the krautrock music movement that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has passed through the collective pop memory, but in no way has it left any lasting traces that this band is painfully missing after 32 years.
Why shouldn’t the Germans celebrate the legends of their 70s?
Especially that what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement to the members of the Cologne ensemble Can in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the hall with incomprehensible faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their laudation, the amazement was boundless.
At the concerts, he was an old friend of Michael Rother with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overwhelmed by Harmonia only because the trio only existed for two years, and during this time it had far less effect than was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar under the Schaubühne theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-funded record company.
Rother briefly assisted the band Kraftwerk, and at the same time gained a reputation as the guitarist of perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu!.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into their exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rum, they lived as a Communist who fled the city.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius struggled as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein song was found in the garbage and thus they found a name for their art.
Some of these things are recorded in Harmony.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is titled "De Luxe".
Despite his modest and relaxed music, the band was in financial need.
The collection of roses alone did not ensure self-discovery.
"Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of less than 50 people.
Forcing Harmony and practicing occasionally was Rother’s idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esoterics and supported himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album of Griessem is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of taking care of krautrock as a specific German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug up as well as Roedelius’ solo work.
The revival of Harmonia takes place at the House of Cultures in Berlin.
From public funds, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, our British ancestor and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
Loveparade’s inventor Dr. Motte is also present.
This roughly outlines the effect of krautrock on the subsequent era of pop music.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the vacant space reserved for the super-team.
Brian Eno’s statement floats in the room with the most unusual sounds: “The only true music is his future.”
There are pictures of the producer in a farmhouse room with Harmonia.
The projection of additional black and white photographs of the tangled wired equipment serves to build the legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means attaching microphones to the organ and drum kits with the intention of using instruments to extract sound effects that have not been heard before, using devices that produce sound effects that have been sculpted by themselves.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three craftsmen, deeply crafted.
Even the house does not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and pussip, and at a beautiful part they sing with empathy "Aaaaaaaaah!"
After all, krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical skills (Kraftwerk), or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If one cries '68' here, he is not completely on the wrong path, and Harmonia still does not allow itself to be distracted by this.
Even the most self-evident thing is thought through on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can make a person nervous, or it can give him the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films once again deal with the war in the Balkans.
None of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Even Richard Gere can't help that in Hunt.
First, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they have found actor Richard Gere right there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Lately, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the '80s, as many of the good-boys-nothing roles he played in emotional movies for women and the many press conferences he has given on the subject of Buddhism have even deprived us of a glance at him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the strongest argument for maybe even watching "Hunting."
It offers a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt is exactly what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious to him: A man who has long left behind his most beautiful years, but has retained much of his former charm as a ruinous monument to his decline.
However, the film "Hunting" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also began to be screened this week, continue the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovar snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that for once, the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film bearing the shallowness of television films is too quickly lost in shootings and eventful scenes.
He carries the "Cobra 11" character - a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Hunting", it is exemplary to see why no really good films have been made about the war in the Balkans.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who are rolling up to find the Serbian war criminal named "The Fox", a different director, a different screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) at a different time might have become a new "Apocalypse Now".
The stories have a surprising resemblance: In both cases, small groups go into the forest to do what the army can’t do – and in both cases, the journey is insane.
One of the reasons for the failure of "Hunting" is that he simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be the depraved cynic that he initially introduces him to.
No, and in the script, he even spends on a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"Hunting" will end when the reporters, in the last five minutes of the film, achieve what NATO, the CIA and all bounty hunters in the world have not been able to do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would prefer to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to make the case that Karadzic and Mladic are still on the loose, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this they are supposedly still exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough due to secret political bargaining.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes about a wooden mask depicting an Asian demon on his desk: "I look with pity at his temple at the twitching artery that tells me how tiring it is to be bad."
Movies like Hunting have the same oversized masks in the shape of a human head that show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were a ugly failure.
There hasn’t been a good movie about South Africa yet.
It’s almost always true: When a star wanders the world’s depressions or minefields, it turns out to be something like “The Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close from the point of view of time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to be able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List."
Probably some of the movies are still ripe, as the classics of the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jackett", were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it is conceivable that nowadays, when all the mass murders arrive in our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that deprives screenwriters of the ignorance of reality that would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, “Be or not be” or “The Dictator” were so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn’t know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do the good thing if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to take a sarcasticly distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière Lexicon" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "It just depends on certain things never changing.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust is heavily criticised for resigning from the Olympics
The mayor’s distancing from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has been the subject of heated criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue to fight for water games.
Von Beus, however, strongly warns of the realities of the odds.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce’s chief executive, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the retreat “unfavourable to the economic environment”.
No other project has recently unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain a steady momentum in sports policy.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that "starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation in early December on the Munich application for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
“Preferring this to us means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have been thinking about.”
But we do not give up the dream, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) expressed regret over von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to compete in the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to miss an opportunity to bury our plans already," HSB President Günter Ploß said in a statement.
Moreover, the withdrawal is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception at the General Assembly of the German College Sports Association.
In 2015, Von Beust’s bid for the 2015 Universiade in Hamburg was described as not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition only last week.
The SPD’s civilian group blamed the Senate for missing valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and did not build housing,” said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
Whilst the SPD has consistently supported Kleiner Grasbrook’s integrated Olympic and subsequent housing recovery plans, the CDU has unilaterally focused on the “event factor”.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg was aroused by enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who connects Sweden with wooden boxes is thinking of IKEA, not Andy Warhol.
Or do you?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Boxes listed here are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, the internal investigation of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to a sobering conclusion: The Pontus Hultén, a large part of the "Brillo Box" given to Moderna Museet in 1995.
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial stunts.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York - painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition held at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo boxes were exhibited: These were not (for cost-saving reasons) from Warhol, but were shipped directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It wasn’t about artworks, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
However, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to produce a few Brillo wallads in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen boxes that rightly entered the history of art and auctions under the designation of "Stockholm-type" as the then certified Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box.
Some of them were auctioned for over <0x24>100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden boxes were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only manufactured in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main museum administrator at Moderna Museet, inspected the museum’s six Brillo Boxes, as well as three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first flattened and sanded down, and the white oil paint was then applied with a brush.
The structure of the replicas from 1990, on the other hand, indicates that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a dye roller, without any foundation – and it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it was investigating “serious accusations” about soap dust boxes.
Since then, however, they have been enclosed in unrelenting silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Resign
In the Philippines, soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to that, government-loyal soldiers using tear gas stormed the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly get rid of 30 sympathizers.
The military police charged with guarding the man evidently turned to him and joined the riot.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have locked up the area around the prestigious hotel.
The president called the security cabinet for an emergency meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales denounced the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the Scout Rangers, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march within a short time.
On Friday, critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president.
The government has been under accusations of corruption for several months.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial district was the main scene for the attempted riot against Arroyo, which was organized by around 200 members of the military.
The insurrection failed just 24 hours later, when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet will become a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has a 20 percent stake in Versatel.
As the company announced on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46.
This represents a holding of 20.05 per cent of the share capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing the shareholding in Versatel remains open.
This move is intended to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Prior to this, assumptions about a possible merger had already been raised on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5% to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution reserves the share to only one third party, it is rumored in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already owned close to 10 percent of the Drillich mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillich has added 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products on the market.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesman for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not exercise their right to take over the remaining 18.49 percent, United Internet reported on Thursday.
The two companies, however, leave all options open, especially with regard to the increase in their shareholding in Freenet AG, the news reported.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been running for months and is now just a matter of fact, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed line customers.
United Internet and Drillich held a 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillich will bring in an additional round four percent.
The right to acquire 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
