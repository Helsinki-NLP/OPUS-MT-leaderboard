The Prague Stock Exchange went down at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the rapid fall in the morning.
Transactions in the shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday from the start of Tuesday’s trading, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the decline in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives’ vote, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Decrease in stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop in stocks on Tuesday, although indicators eventually cancelled some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index recorded a write-off of almost four percent in the course of trading, but later cancelled some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should start negotiations immediately and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make other countries feel the consequences of this.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was supposed to receive <0x24>700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroner).
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went through a bloodbath and leading stock indices recorded the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell nearly seven percent, the last time it fell was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal had not been adopted in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Retreats: US Government Can Pump <0x24>700 Billion in Banks
The Supreme Leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system worth <0x24>700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
But there is no victory yet.
Congress has to complete some of the details of the agreement before it can make public the final form of the law and its vote.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Senate officials say they will probably vote on the bill on Wednesday.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in revitalizing the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, a "sobering up" occurs thereafter.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step.
“We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the form of the market stabilization package should be,” said Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson on Saturday to give a final form to the government fund.
This should buy up the unsold mortgage assets of financial corporations, which put financial corporations at serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to a final agreement on a draft that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The remedial plan still needs to be continued, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal to Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling heavily.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada says lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement on Congress on Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors before the start of trading on the Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress could be the first to influence Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, nor is it clear whether the trial could be blocked at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
President George W. Bush said the first <0x24>350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the release of the remaining amount, which is set at an additional <0x24>100 billion and later <0x24>350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that were losing their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was “satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restrictions on large redundancy payments
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, said the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the financing draft.
The new law also restricts the so-called bussy redundancy payments of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this and made great progress towards a deal that will work and benefit all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for the mortgages it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual aid
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed draft is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because it is not possible to know with what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share their losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not that important whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give its blessings as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on blade: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobile devices can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make phone calls.
It seems clear from this that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons to purchase a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
You’ll probably have a hard time getting a high-end, expensive turntable to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc disc.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, you’re probably dreaming of such a turntable.
This is similar to travel-destined, i.e. compressed - in short, MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would probably find it difficult to accept a 20-kroon market earphone.
There are two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
Wide choice.
The life of the batteries also matters
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but also do what most mobile phones don’t even happen to do.
No device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, as no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can take photos.
Multi-functional mobile phones also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, with cheap mobile phones, you should expect that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you’re even on the phone here and there, get another charger for your workplace just to be safe – this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a single charge.
The next issue arises when uploading music to a mobile device.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB socket, and besides, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPods), players do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library sorted by the artist, album, genre name, or user rating, for example.
Some devices display only a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, with a smart phone operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, inquire first of all about battery life, memory capacity, audio output quality and type, and of course, the convenience of handling.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and you only listen to it daily for a short period of time on the tram, for example, any mobile device that plays MP3 will be suitable for you.
This is something that any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player can do.
All of them will cope with MP3, and the vast majority of the music you receive will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most popular, and besides it, the vast majority of devices can handle WMA music as well.
AAC (the format used by Apple and for your iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, online music purchases.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service in itself can be a powerful argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is crappy and usually limited to annual radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that such a method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you can scan your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your hands-free hands-free.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair enough walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of the output of your traditional earphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm hole headphones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
However, the advantages of the players are, among other things, their ease of use.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) really cope with everyone.
Minimal functionality, handling similar to the previously standard cassette tape or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of a crash in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet, or a massive bill for data transmission that follows.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
Buying the right card can cost up to 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivet.
Based on the capacity (up to 2 GB), you don’t have to spend more than 1100 kronor.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the convenience of handling is closer to the MP3 player.
The Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the industry’s biggest success.
MP3 players of the aforementioned brands can offer the same service in the same price range up to four thousand kroons, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe...
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classic operators to substantially reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be for long.
On the Mobile.cz website we have written many times that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the European Commission’s recent move to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation – texts sent from abroad to some of the Czech mobile operators’ customers will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is no real competition.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office, has often agreed with this, as he has previously stated several times that there is no room for a new operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classical provider with its own network is unlikely to have too many chances (though it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant price reduction, which the classic service providers also had to respond to.
Even before the big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, sounds like ours were heard in the UK.
However, it has been proven that such providers have their place and can really be successful.
However, we do not need to go too far for example.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider in the country.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic, among other things, owns U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers around the world tend to appear as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good bet to bet on a target group.
This company is specially focused on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether an idea like the one in Poland can work for us.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem to be very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it showed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their utmost to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for some time now, which aims to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information suggests that we may be lucky to have the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is now surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that a full-featured virtual service provider has a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
Until now, we have not been approached by a unique subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefónica 02 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, exceptionally agrees with O2, adding: "To date, we have not recorded a single viable and bilaterally advantageous business project on which we could continue to build."
And he added, “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will pop up.
At this moment, we should have a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term.”
Vodafone focuses more on fulfilling its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, primarily in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most rewarding for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is partnering with the development of shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - on the same line with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, and the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a fall in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
When service providers are able to collaborate on something important, they testify to the long run around the birth of the U:phone.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>TU was probably around the birth of the T-Mobile company’s U:phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on <0xC4><0x8C>TU’s website.
But right now, U:phone is a good reason why we shouldn’t allow the virtual service provider to log in.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment of a competitor in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be highly demanding.”
Given this attitude of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulators is astonishing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the agency is characteristic of the whole problem.
“The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider to lease the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for traditional service providers,” Kristián Chlapua, from the Foreign Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority, said in response to our question.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the agency which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, this is more than odd.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
However, it is likely that the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS do not include the pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices.
In this case, it is a shocking coherence that emerges from the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just like at the filling stations, the exact same gasoline prices are surely the product of coincidence and fierce competition.
"The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a leading position, i.e. they have no proportionately greater responsibility for their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably lacking for the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of market leadership is one of the many points of controversy.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, there is no Czech operator in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators behave strikingly similarly.
In the meantime, the complaints of interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiating with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hands off the whole matter.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecoms Act, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>TU’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not carried out, although many experts hoped that the situation would improve.
Representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, many of which are already operating on Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
They are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a priority customer, you will then receive special quotes (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar advances.
"If there were any of the cases you are talking about, there would be a breach of contract that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová said in response to our question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that news of such activities would not have reached the responsible people of the mobile operators.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider will defend itself against such a procedure.
These companies have not negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatening them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phones, so they cannot have it in full as general customers of mobile operators."
But at least that’s what the CTU should find strange.
In addition, there is another question that arises for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators are ignoring a similar procedure, why are they obstructing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively strong powers to expose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this kind and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has brought about a noticeable fall in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to prevent them more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small or perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, which in no way defended the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider that others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are handing over the whole matter to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are useful to them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may start moving again.
If one service provider would allow a virtual mobile service provider to be established, it is difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And maybe we won't make phone calls more expensive than the rest of Europe.
There are four new versions of the Czech anthem.
Choose the best
Listen to four editions of the new version of the Czech State Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the State Anthem Where Is My Homeland on the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlavík.
There are four versions available – male or female solo, with choir or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the modification of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohrávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen young singers with representative voices, expressive and popular, to sing solo variations.
"From the very beginning, both of them and later at the band, I tried to take care of the pure diction, the clarity of the lyrics and the consistency," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where Is My Homeland?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, complemented by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously regarded it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state emblems.
What is the “new” hymn?
Prague transport company to deliver chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, enter the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passenger enters the metro, tram and bus with an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
The coupon is currently available to around 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (valid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time save it on their chip card at the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztydok, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Rajskáh z.
Coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers throughout the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet may forget the windows of the subway stations, where they have had to make long queues for line tickets on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the City Library’s thirteen accounts.
“Passengers at these locations will have a counter with trained servers to help those interested to shop online and save their purchased vouchers to their cards,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, project spokesman.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencard in the self-service vending machines installed in some lobbys.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket handlers and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vlatavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is checked automatically instead of the driver
Managing machines that start operating tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly residents of the districts of central Bohemia travel to the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Prague, the guides were equipped with card readers to determine the zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, which compiled the schedule for public transport in Prague.
In the buses around the city, card readers are installed by the driver at the checkout.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at the location specified on the checkout page.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so," Drápal added.
Passengers who travel by buses outside the city and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines to save the coupons on cards.

Sudanese Demands U.S. Referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the annexation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This is apparent from a letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Library of Science.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that this is the wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also revealed by a letter from a private archive, which is nowadays preserved in the collection of the South Bohemian Library of Science.
In the letter, the Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov ask the US president not to allow the re-deportation of the “county of Shumava” to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“The situation has been correctly interpreted and we really want to be certain of the words that American troops are arriving in German territories not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava.”
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia by the Sudeten Germans is said to be a source of only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava "for ever and ever".
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, he would consider this territory to be a foreign country to us, oppressing and ravaging the minority and contributing almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason the authors could not sign is allegedly the fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors."
So if the president of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the Shumava Germans, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in Shumava County on whether his residents would like to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive, given the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe it adequately depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had minimally suspected that they would be expelled from the country, few of them recognized the possibility of this.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others hoped to stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and sent to the Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tynskó prison camp, dozens of other Czech German Jitsts were added to him to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they came home they would benefit from the Czech language," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war had expected to be expelled from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for road safety.
The media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, would still be characterised by emotion.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office hopes this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The <0x24>150-million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
It seeks to address the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What appears in the advertisements?
Emotional stories, especially human ones.
The whole campaign's "blood" slogan is proof of this:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is printed in large letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "pay" in the pool of blood.
This should symbolize the fact that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one’s life.
Advertisers are "scared" until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims can be viewed regularly.
They hope to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go to the drivers
"Drivers are subject to the 'pull, let go' system.
For them, 'fly it' is when, for example, they pass a red light, thereby saving time.
"Pull" is a threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why the information campaign in the press is needed, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
The driver’s warning signs are less effective.
"If a warning sign is installed, it is likely that it will quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will not take care of it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would give back almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the Israeli interim government Ehud Olmer spoke about the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview with Jediot Achron on Monday.
“We have to make an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we have to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over a similar percentage of Israeli territory to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and who, first and foremost, wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the July attack on two cities where some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Hill, sacred and historical sites” in the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he stressed.
Exodus from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an essential condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend making peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know well what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current ties with Iran; they must give up their ties with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must give up their regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al Qaeda and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after an accident: Are passenger stewardesses illegal on buses?
The law does not know them, they are not allowed to walk in long-distance buses
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question has been raised as to whether passengers and stewardesses can use the bus while on the road.
"If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activities of the flight attendant would be in conflict with the Transport Act," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of a truck crossing the road.
Unfortunately for the girl, she was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place on the bus at that moment, although two more seats were occupied for her.
The bus can collide or suddenly brake the moment the steward serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It is important to determine whether the bus has a parking space according to the registration.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses do not have parking spaces; this has been confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the company’s director.
“We tried to find a solution with the ministry, and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law does not know the flight attendant.
"There is no clear legal requirement for the role of a flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of accompanying vehicles; it does not define its rights and obligations," says spokeswoman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of Road Vehicle Operations at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law addresses the problem properly.
"It depends on whether there is a parking space on the bus's license.
And that's the end," he says.
Buses and coaches can be urban, with standing spaces and limited maximum speed, and between cities with standing spaces and allowed higher speeds, and long-distance buses without standing spaces and with seats with seat belts at the maximum speed.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, BESIP’s traffic safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of cabin crew on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in continuous progress, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not even sure when there's a turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
“But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be solved by the carrier through internal rules," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura ready to discontinue services
The Student Agency offers cabin crew services as the only bus carrier.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the manager does not consider their occupation to be risky.
“As soon as I get the impression that stewardship is a risky occupation, I’m going to end it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on board.
That would also save money," he said.
Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants in his vehicles for safety reasons.
“We don’t have flight attendants, we’ve been against this from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal injury,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz just a year ago.
An unbelievable tragedy happened
A young flight attendant from Plze<0xC5><0x88> who worked for the company for two years died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a turn signal and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus made a sudden maneuver to escape, but the right front part of the bus collided.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the sale of the two reserved spaces for the rest of the flight attendants.
"These seats on long-haul flights cannot be booked, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By compensating the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
A law change?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movement of passenger attendants on board the bus could be the amendment to the law, which has been working on for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport.
“The group did not have any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system on the motorway deals with the maximum permissible speed and mobile usage while driving," says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," Hanzelka said, concluding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and employment offices.
Dusseldorf's hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could form “the central capital market organization of the savings bank financial group”, the letter said.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable ‘competence block’ into such a business.
Such a link could give a decisive impetus to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The precarious WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is tight.
For savings bank clients, however, the relationship between the Deka-Bank, which is famous for its investment funds, and WestLB has been on the agenda for some time now – also on the Frankfurt side.
As early as the end of August, Deka-Bank manager Franz Waas announced in the presentation of the half-year figures that the merger of the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB would not make sense.
Nonetheless, the board of directors of Deka, half of which is composed of representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of representatives of the savings banks associations, mandated the board of directors to negotiate joint business activities with WestLB.
In this case, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations, according to financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first time the name has come up in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a moment that Deka-Bank was merging with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
However, this triple alliance did not succeed.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessian provincial government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was transferred to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a relationship between the Deka Bank and the Landesbanks has been repeatedly raised.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a realisation that there is a need for convergence between the different banks in the public sector.
Now, after the Bavarian regional assembly elections, the first to be expected is the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may gradually run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger partner, even though he has survived the financial crisis far better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with WestLB was excluded by the Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen with an 85% share in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
In the absence of better, NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank are compatible.
In June, Merl said that the German Savings Bank and Gouvernements Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what kind of business model should be used to ensure the future of regional banks.
Finally, WestLB may be dismembered, but this is obviously not the case there.
Thus, the board of directors there also states that they are definitely looking for a "complete solution".
How this can be reconciled with the merger of the individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's the first time for Elena, and the third or fourth time for Luca.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-branded five-liter barrel, stands a strong-bodied bearded man, telling the 200 people who travel to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can bring out of his throat.
Elena first grabs Luca's face and then kisses her.
They arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking near Puorta Nuova railway station, four buses depart at 23.45 to destination "destination Monaco, festa della" with arrival expected at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, while the fourth bus is reserved exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans started singing alongside their flags and began celebrating at night.
And so loud that it's not for Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, faux fur coat and wide, silvery glasses.
He travelled to the Oktoberfest five years ago, only this year he organized three trips.
At night, during the daytime at the Oktoberfest, home at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a guided tour in German - Marco has taken a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already plunging into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
It's okay, they're gonna need their strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses take a short break in front of Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 p.m. as planned, there are already nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final briefing, explaining the plan of the war.
First, everyone put on the yellow cap.
On the left side is the inscription "Oktoberfest" in fractal letters, next to it is the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors of the beer tent open, run," Marco exclaims in the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying the seats in the back of the tent.
“Not ahead, for we will be stuck, and let not all the yellow hats sit on the same benches, but let us be scattered in the tent.”
The one-liter jar costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.25, Marco yells.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will be taken!”
Third, "Be back here at exactly 11:30 tonight." Do you understand?
And we're headed to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men ties yellow caps to trees, boards and even an election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no accurate figures; there are 50,000 people talking about crossing the Alps, rushing into beer tents, allegedly 10% of all visitors this weekend come from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, with Italian volunteers assisting the Bavarian Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, occupies the first place with about 200 medical treatments, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British at the bottom of the podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even weaved into his statement that the German banking sector is not spared by the crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Munich real estate company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulences.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that loan subsidies amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the portion used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
Depfa, a state-financed company, has lent money to long-term projects and refinanced them for a very short period of time, which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio decreased moderately from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, revenues from claims credits and specific securities, as well as revenues from the liquidation of loan business provisions, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-post accounting costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax ruling and the acquisitions of the companies belonging to the group, the revenue deficit of approximately 16% was relatively moderate.
After the privatisation in 1990, the former state financer first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently segregated in Aeral Bank.
As classical state funding was scarce to earn, Depfa increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and private-public partnerships (PPPs) with the state, and expanded its activities internationally.
On the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate will now have to make write-downs that have a “significant impact” on the group’s profit and loss account, they said in a fairly general manner.
In fact, no dividend was paid.
Dividends were cut to a third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depfa.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending between banks has stalled as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable period of time and the company is protected “from the influence of international financial markets that are currently largely inoperable.”
According to other sources, thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Georg Funke, stated that the Hypo Real Estate group would not have to use the financial markets for a period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incalculability of the crisis, they cannot be sure.
It is not even inconceivable that it is not necessary to make full use of the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
As the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are quite well maintained.
While debts in the first place are barely changing, the exchange rates of backsold bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis affects in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value stability should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system due to the exacerbation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are ready to support the system, we can start by paying the annuities on time.
Or something that almost no one is hoping will be able to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
In view of the reports relating to partial nationalization, however, the probability that borders on certainty has now become merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, sleepless nights can be triggered by the decision whether to give up their investment.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start laughing: The German chick is totally "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangas - in her new student exchange blog she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so nervous.
On the way to school, I was sore.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, heading to Kawasaki, and 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start at eight o’clock, and at eight o’clock and 40 o’clock, a short conversation with the teacher begins, the “home room”.
But before teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, my hostess put on an old skirt, a blouse, blue knee-highs and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of your cathedral in this outfit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I am from Germany, and in a week's time my birthday will be.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had been learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, smiling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
Then I jumped quickly into my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide and felt honored to be seated next to the exchange student.
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the bell rang, they rushed as usual.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and their questions were drilling holes in my belly—although it was quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their benches.
My host has prepared such a lunch for me - it's completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu wrapped meat.
I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very tasty.
Well, yeah, except for the salty plums, brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
In Japanese schools, bento is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a bento made with her own hands, which she assembles especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe it here.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm just fascinated."
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of comic books and the culture they describe, I started learning Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here someday.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
These are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends – on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats have emotions too.
A rat or a moth fleeing in danger. Does this mean that he feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we see if they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" famous scientists have published their articles for years.
In one of his series, SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and examine the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we come to a difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers infer comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This wide area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are, or the ability to plan and decide, it can reasonably be assumed that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since much of the human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might be like in other animals.
If consciousness is not measurable as an internal and subjective thing, and cannot be analyzed by our own experiences because of the special hardware, then his research puts us in serious trouble.
Most of my discussions are about the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments with short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, this assumption, which has been examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What does this mean for the feelings?
I draw this back to the fact that an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and humans in particular.
In addition to the linguistic character, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states, to describe them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions originate from simpler activities in the body’s perception areas of the cerebral cortex and brain stem, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in interspecies-wide emotions.
I cannot deny this purely theoretically, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases as well: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach fleeing in the event of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, similar behavior alone is not proof of the same experience.
Although neuronal comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, cockroaches don’t even have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if we could prove it in humans, how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm researching the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't study emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Time of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vasyunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux the confidence in Ukraine and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine can organise the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasyunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries are lagging behind when it comes to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible to reduce the number of EB stadiums from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN federation, which was replaced by independent inspector Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have confirmed in a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Championship."
In the last season alone, several first league teams had to be subdivided due to manipulation, and in the end the league was postponed.
The outraged Dennis Quaid is back.
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she has a problem with her ex-husband. Hollywood star Meg Ryan has classified her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulteress.
The one who squeals - and strikes back
Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors fight a nasty battle in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time, "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me so much pain."
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis had cheated on him with.
The psychic striptease came because of Ryan's press work on his new film, "Women," which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid responded firmly to his pronouncement as an unfaithful husband: "It's awful," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is boringly repeating and rehearsing the story of our relationship."
In addition, it is “unfortunate” that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly “publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce causes to a child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a twin couple.
His response concludes with the following page cut: “My life continues anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family where everything is fine.”
Lower prices for flights and hotel rooms
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, in Germany, flights were no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Flight and hotel rates have again improved, according to a study by American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after the price increase in the first quarter, found a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After the prices in the hotel market had risen for years, the hotels had already become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
In the April to June period, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason American Express sees is the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to “the sluggish travel appetite of American tourists.”
The drop in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
Hotel prices in Norway have risen by 26.3%, a European record.
There was also an increase in airfare prices in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel consumption increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, prices for economy-class flights fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but prices for business and first-class flights only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights to Germany has been halved, according to the study.
The reason for the fall in prices lies in the slowdown in economic growth, the company says.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the airline market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is justified by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines, and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - affecting 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV 1:0 kills Gladbach
Hamburger SV was placed at the top of the table with a goal and simple methods.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only came into play late, and his raise bounced back from the goalkeeper.
His precise message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the corridor leading to the cabins at the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying more prestige than some former players.
So your request was heard at the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command might have been the same: Give me the second goal!
The order was not executed.
"Today was not always a nice sight," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt had a "less imagination" about it.
A score of 1: 0 (1: 0) was scored by Mladen Petric of Hamburg (11th); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachians were unable to cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win," Martin Jol said.
Hamburger SV will turn 121 on Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, representing their team as the championship class leader.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
He understands that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself, it is not yet brilliant thanks to its late-dedicated acquisitions – Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern.
"We need more sensitivity and trickery," Jol demanded.
After the dismissal
Wall Street is full of fear.
As a result of the first news of the rescue package's failure, the Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was at a good 5% minus and stood at 10,579 points.
The technology paper dealer Nasdaq fell by more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest loser of the Dow at the time was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with a loss of 12%.
No paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank shares fell by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, investor Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage bonds.
However, the amount is not paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive share option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be used if exchange rates developed properly, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and American and stock prices on a downward trend
Billion-dollar aid to European and American banks does not dispel investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German Hypo Real Estate is falling and it is taking Dax with it.
The US Dow Jones is declining despite the planned financial market rescue.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German equity index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The value of Munich’s real estate financing shares fell to a quarter despite a rescue effort by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.

Stock markets have fallen to their knees worldwide.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges have only one direction: in London, the FTSE index declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial increase of 1.26 percent.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheimer has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group has also said that Thomas Cook shares will not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The "Ulysses" spacecraft flew in space for almost 18 years.
The soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines are threatening him with frostbite.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational rocket maneuver of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in a celestial object, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
In this way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physics trick.
But what has astonished scientists for years now is that flying objects don’t behave exactly as expected by the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, irregularities occur in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
This phenomenon is known as a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which conceives the gravitational pull of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found near Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter was discovered by space scientists only ten years ago.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that has an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that one-fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in the prison of their abductees, the tourists who were deported in Egypt are free again, Italy’s foreign minister said.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini has confirmed the fact of his release: “Our fellow citizens and the rest of the hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their state of health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
Nineteen desert expeditioners are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of them.
“The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was only about taking hostages," when suddenly "the surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers have shot and arrested six kidnappers in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to one of the hostage's German wives.
The daily "al-Masri al-Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers will release the female hostages after the ransom has been paid.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
'Suicide leads to' stepfather violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather abused her for years.
Michael Trerise, a 57-year-old from Stithians County, Cornwall, has spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly bound his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confession, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied and bandaged her eyes before intercourse while her mother worked in a beer shop.
In the 1980s, Trerise divorced his wife and chose to live in Cornwall again.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the trial revealed that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was persecuted by the horrors of twice-weekly violence.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was described by her friends as "emotionally dead" and "giving up on life."
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle clashed with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his confession in a letter, saying, "I've always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re an extremely strange fetishist, and I’m sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family story ended in the victim committing suicide.
Even more thought-provoking, however, is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice.”
The judge added, “I draw attention to Stephanie’s parents’ view of how the crime you committed has affected their daughter over the years.
If it hadn’t happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
Officer losing important data has been charged
According to the BBC, a government official who left highly classified documents on a train in June was accused of breaching official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest allegation of violation of the law and there is no suspicion of wilful misconduct.
According to Frank Gardner, a correspondent for the BBC Department of Defense, the move surprised many people in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Department of Defense and the government would treat the incident as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been charged under Section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about preserving information.
The state prosecutor's office has suggested that the charges against the official should be represented by the Metropolitan Police because of the man's rather sensitive nature of his work with the Unified Intelligence Commission.
The documents he lost included covert surveys on Al Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay B&amp;B’s bill
UK housing cooperatives are expected to face a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million following the rescue of Bradford & amp; Bingley bank.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion on 2.6 million account holders to protect their deposits at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the BSA, said it was “annoying” for companies and their members to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after the mortgages of Bradford & Bingley have been repaid.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have so far acted cautiously ... now have to pay the bills of institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay the amount of deposit it has in its possession. The companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to put <0xC2><0xA3>81 million aside to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the union of housing companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that institutions that have been prudent during the boom of the housing market have to pay the bills of much less prudent institutions.”
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since they started operations in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from significant bills,” Cole said.
The interest rate due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full year’s interest rate, which could be twice as high as the current one.
Because housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, eventually the members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will increase the price of milk by an additional five pennies per liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-penny increase in February and after a survey conducted by a consultancy firm.
It is up to retailers to decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, wholesale milk prices in Jersey changed for the last time in 2002.
Former Bangladesh MEP's request to defend his freedom was rejected
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request by former MP Sheikh Hasina to defend himself at liberty, which means he could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His attorney said the court denied him his defense on charges of extorting 50 million takas (<0x24>729.700) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless accusations of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country's military-backed interim government first grant him full freedom.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of his release whether he will be able to retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The Court of Appeals rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail application by saying that it is not necessary because he has already been temporarily released and is undergoing medical treatment abroad,” Huq said.
"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself at liberty in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed provisional government took over, but was released from prison in June to receive medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been excluded from the recent polio vaccination programme due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said, for security reasons, they were unable to reach the children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A U.N. spokesperson said this was despite the Taliban’s promise that they would not attack or hinder the work of the thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB's Appeal Refused for ITV
BskyB’s appeal against the Competition Committee’s decision to reduce its interest in rival TV broadcaster ITV was rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeals ordered BSkyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The committee had previously concluded that BSkyB’s shareholding hinders competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the acquisition by BSkyB of a stake in ITV threatened the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin’s director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups, and Ofcom’s supervisory board all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV shareholding was an unreasonable and disproportionate compensation, especially given that BSkyB had stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of U.S. Attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move was followed by a report prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Justice Department criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Chief Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the prosecutors had been fired for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation tried to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious accusations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated or cleared," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a statement.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who would have the power to force witnesses to testify.
In December 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine state prosecutors from their posts.
At the time, it was said that the state's attorneys were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissed state prosecutors received no worse evaluation than many of their colleagues, which led many to conclude that the dismissals were based on political considerations.
Some state prosecutors were involved in criminal prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others refused to take part in the investigation of allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
The U.S. state prosecutors are conducting investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, then chief prosecutor of the Justice Department, became the target of attacks on the dismissals and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
In his report, the Inspector General criticized Gonzales' role in the case, saying that the Chief Prosecutor had "primary responsibility" for the redundancies, "resigned" his leadership role, and "remarkably pulled himself out of the process."
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to Bush Sr., have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epic Receives Recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive an award at the Q Awards for her epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold medal at the London ceremony next week, said he would be honored to receive the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, and was nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is like that."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a very high sound, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental stage.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for almost nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been experiencing health problems lately. In 2003, he underwent surgery after collapsing on stage due to a heart rhythm disorder.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and perhaps soon sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards and other side roads, some famous, others purely for practical purposes.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and local residents who have lived here for a long time would find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The little street is in East Village and is heading north from First Street—without reaching Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
No street signs.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard map.
The streets have admirers.
There, for example, is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to rebuild the Extra Place and ensure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be accessed on a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are the neighbors who lived here for a long time, who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that this was the only remnant of the area’s pre-renovation past.
However, the owner of the street, the building preservation and development department of the city, has no interest in insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee prefers the street to remain under the control of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of the 3rd municipal council.
"There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
“We may have suggestions for its renovation and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to guarantee that it remains available to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to rebuild the small street and provide it with seats. Some of these would be used by a café, which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first announced at the meeting this month.
Avalon Bay spokeswoman Michele de Milly said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
"The main point of view of Avalon Bay is to rebuild this degraded alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city had recommended buying it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Bureau, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the office’s job was to develop the buildings, not to manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, the Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say it was called "no man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The Punk-Rock Monument, which closed in 2006, the CBGB's back exit opened to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most notable for the fact that it was there that the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia" was taken.
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes, barrels and posters, and leaf and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class acquired East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain the property of the community.
Others mention the Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog "The disappearing New York of Jeremiah" ("The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgia of the Extinction of the City"), posted on his blog a part of the story about Extra Place that appeared in the weekly newspaper "The New Yorker" in the column "City Rumors" in 1952.
The author Brendan Gill wrote, "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end street that is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty iron storage doors and spatula windows, where one-week newspapers are carried in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the end of the street by the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a high-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty beer bottle of 0.75 liters was lying next to a pile of dumped fresh newspaper.
Some passersby said they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think it might need a refurbishment.
Fields said he thought some people underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies and senior director of education research at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute, is a co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking regions.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are included here.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
To overcome such performance gaps, Obama’s education plan explicitly supports – among other things – “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on non-English school education, outweighs his interest in overcoming the big performance gaps.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contracted Primary School in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
In spite of this, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Equally impressive is the fact that 93% of fourth graders passed the English Language and Literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, constant evaluation of skills, and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is “total immersion” of English students into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in the teaching of other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: “We’ve had overwhelming success in that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t realize who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set an example to be followed by schools such as Sixth Street Prep for other Spanish-speaking and English-speaking schools?
The school’s achievements should make the answer clear, but because of its party’s education policy (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and because of its own consistent advocacy of bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently underestimated the issue by saying that people should not be so worried about the “exclusive Englishness” of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should get your kids to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the gaps in results, he should seriously study the models that work, rather than despise and ignore them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America’s rescue plan for the financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7% to <0x24>99.80 on the New York Stock Exchange this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost <0x24>90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before falling again under the influence of immense uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, concerns rekindled investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement this weekend on the largest economic rescue operation in history.
The news has been overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event in the emerging crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, “the rescue operation seems to have failed to revive the stock market’s trading spirit.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, such as oil, is also expected to decline.
"The future of the stock market, interest rates and foreign exchange markets around the world has become uncertain," a Deutsche Bank analyst told investors.
"We believe that the market for commodities will not be avoided by the 'epidemic'.
From the point of view of the commodity market, the biggest question is to what extent the U.S. 'disease' will infect the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets for the past eight seasons than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in the defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals’ lukewarm game became fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, a quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, making it the perfect forerunner for an afternoon during which their unfolding collaboration developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdowns in this quarter, including two consecutive cornerbacks 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I'm not sorry for the trouble," Favre said of all the passes he gave to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We’ve been able to communicate well with each other no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who played in the cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back by 32 yards, which scored a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player, reached for another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, a linebacker, managed to get the ball out of Warner's hand.
This could have been the most amazing moment of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the score at 34:0.
This was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that the Cardinals scored 21 points in both quarters without the Jets scored one, Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short time.”
Gebrselassie breaks her own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why he was considered by many to be the best mid- and long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record on Sunday in Berlin, making him the first to run the 42.2 km in two hours and four minutes.
With a win at 2:03:59 on a comfortable level, Gebrselassie improved his previous score at 2:04:26 by 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his career in such a wide range of fields that he has won the World Championships or achieved a world record in almost every race from the 1500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing that air pollution would exacerbate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, initially at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and finally at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C - Gebrselassie won Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon’s first runners, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a 2:06:05.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a cramp in his legs and was unable to exercise for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
He has received some criticism – especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – that he uses too many aids in his races, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, relies on his speed runners as if he were running on track, and puts world records ahead of the racing spirit.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes the greatness of Gebrselassie in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint in 1:02:04 on Sunday with four Kenyan runners.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were exhausted.
Shortly before the finish, Gebrselassie beat Kwambai by a final sprint, finishing second at 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakh-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German national, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest win at 2:19:19.
The world record will be held by Briton Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
He was unable to attend the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes. This was the third distance marathon he participated in.
He won the race with clever calculations: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain a significant lead, and then, after running about 30 km, he went after them.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with 2:25.01.
A Separate City, the Pride and Trials of Blacks
A few miles from everything that glitters, is loud and mighty, the Greater Orlando adventure park hides in a quiet little town where the pride and complexity of African-American life was born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country and which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guayavas and a city of two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, which is a celebration of the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guide published by the Crisis Age Federal Writers Project, is distinct from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified, and closed-minded as it was in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that urban blacks in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year when Black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open debate on the race issue, many here are mistrusting the eyes of outsiders.
“We are very careful about how our story is told,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all her life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to tell it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
It is a historically significant model of black’s stance, but it is also a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty rates double the national average.
It is partly a literary hub and partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are proud and defensive at the same time.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (here everyone calls Hurston that).
In books written in sincere, strong dialect, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which is located next to Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature like a drum, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more intimate spheres.
To the right of the road, we find a modern public school with a white border on a brown background, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds maintained by Howard Miller, although he can barely read or write.
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and whatever you may need in transitional shelters."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
Not everyone really liked this description.
"Zora said things the way they were," said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old Johnson girl. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like that.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a living stranger who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a rumbling Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing long pants to a city where people still pride themselves on their dignified dress.
"Most people were fascinated," Franklin said, "but many were delighted."
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were never published again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
In Eatonville there were no significant memorials or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood how much it enriched the world, or what it left behind at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, "Wrapped in a Rainbow."
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in community life.
The expansionist Orlando has already penetrated the state-connected Interstate 4 motorway on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult period in history.
Among other things, forced integration put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles with racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"A group of white boys came over at the time and threw oranges and other things at those on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to impose forcibly integration, stating that Brown v. Board of Education was "a violation of my race rather than a respect for it."
Today, residents say that school segregation, although positive in some respects, weakened the cohesion of the people of eatonville and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
"Black kids are used to being hugged -- I remember that -- a man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, executive director of the nonprofit organization "Guard the Community of Eatonville."
"This took as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher -- I mean, there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have risen above prejudices, as she did, with as optimistic self-confidence and lines as: “How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a renowned Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of bookshops, once again placing him among America’s role models.
The road construction project was about to begin when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans attended the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its road construction proposal.
“Due to the five lanes of the main road, the community has been revived, turned to full speed, which is a real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd put it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city’s image of itself.
An increasing number of outsiders, such as Rachelle Munson, who began attending church in 1993, began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on Kennedy Avenue, which was re-encrusted and embellished.
Eatonville remained the cuckoo egg of Florida: not quite ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; as small as when it was founded in the 1880s by 27 black families.
(Ninety percent of the population is black.)
They are still cautious with the outsiders who come here in search of the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things — such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields — should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many—including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red—are afraid that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more widespread, the pride of the hometown also grew.
Young people in particular view Eatonville more and more as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with his problems and everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, as creative, as diligent, as foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, is planning on returning to college to work for the local government or the police, who he believes need help.
And it seems younger people have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of those who are just passing through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Alondra Kenon said recently after the church service on a Sunday.
“But if you stop and take some time to get to know your history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
In New York, we all speak the language of finance.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newsstands and the huge TV projectors on Times Square, they wouldn’t have noticed that they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with their glass-walled beehive-shaped offices above their heads, the bankers and venture fund managers who are in control of New York City have been living the hardest days since 1929.
Couriers are still rolling their metal tea trucks across the sidewalks, delivering trays loaded with muffins for morning meetings.
There are still Spanish-speaking men roaming among the blocks, carrying as human mules fifty pairs of ironed shirts hung over their shoulders in a yoke-like loop.
Office workers are still lined up for their breakfast sweet pastry on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi on weekdays between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
I didn’t feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I deliberately planned to take care of it during the afternoon's rest in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cashier’s window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy’s store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many, I later learned from Starr, the banker who was "assigned to me", were lined up in front of me with the same intentions as I.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdraw money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been quietly bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of <0x24>327 billion, was put under bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers left home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank bailout buyer with savings of <0x24>440 billion.
The office workers and shopkeepers in front of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection buy-outs on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at a local Chinese store on her phone talked about bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and his huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she was complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my apartment, in her 50s, in uniform, changed the subject, not Brad and Angelina, or my groceries, as we usually do.
He told me after I went to the bank, “I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Moslem tombs defamed while Austria tilts to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to unveil the organization "Cities Against the Islamic Conquest".
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed by a red line.
According to police, far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which took place the same weekend when far-right parties made significant advances in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves have been severely damaged at the Traun Cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators used paint spray to draw Jewish symbols, such as the star of David, on some graves, but investigators said they were only trying to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “profoundly shaken” by the news of the grave blasphemy, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience test after yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance tipped to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of Austria, a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were stigmatized as xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the vote, also expressed dislike for the campaign against headscarves and shells, as well as food allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that would help prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which led to the victory of the far right, the change was largely due to the young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child rape, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after informing the authorities that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police have obtained a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of convictions for rape of children against Glitter.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police filed an application with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd’s planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is required to do so by the Act on Registers of Sexual Offenders.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent Police said they didn't want to talk about Glitter's individual cases and possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: “Kent Police are doing everything in their power to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system at our disposal to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent Police is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we are constantly monitoring the behavior of sexual offenders registered and residents in the county to minimize potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The authorities refused to allow him to pass the passport, so he flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to a court in uxbridge, west London, as Scotland Yard requested that he be registered as a sex offender under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source in the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take photographs on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal perspective.” – Günther Bauer, Photographer
No sets, no curls, no dancing shoes.
The grand masters of flamenco, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments away from the audience, when we can pass through a personal gesture, grasp the depth of a captured look, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist who is preparing to perform outside the stage.
The German photographer Günther Bauer’s series Flamenco-people combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, the flamenco’s unique iconography is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, “reflects the growing international significance of flamenco every day,” says the creator, adding that the Flamenco-people “can be anyone, as the viewer realizes that these images represent artists in a non-typical way.
These people who are photographed on the streets are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character dwell in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco players with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival inspired Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which he took portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
These portraits evoke classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of subject.
However, the use of different stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representations and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's vision of flamenco: "This is music with traditional roots, but it is changing day by day and always fascinating."
It is not the dance, nor the song or the music in itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist that enchants the audience.
The main motive of the works to be viewed in the El Fotomata gallery these days is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic varász, which becomes visible through the way of perception, being and representation.
Famous flamenco figures include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be the subject of an album featuring portraits presented at the exhibition.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion for portraits inspired him to repeat the idea with the series “Portraits of Veteran Athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portraits.
You meet people, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know, people you don’t know.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
Selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, the exhibition entitled Flamenco-people can be viewed in the El Fotomata Gallery, located at the parallel of the Alameda de Hércules at the number 20 of the Calle de la Mata, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "ready for audacity."
The location and the plot are unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel, which is protagonisted by Irish nationalist Roger Casemant, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled to the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning writer admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work is “ready to be bold” and “all indications indicate that the novel should not be written”.
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and hopefully someday I’ll be able to put an end to it,” he concluded with these words at the Aqueduct Festival, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists, as well as thousands of visitors, for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes for it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award, an old edition of Dickens's novel "Our Common Friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After Felix Romeo’s greeting, he was welcomed by a devoted audience. For the audience, the hour quickly elapsed, in which the Peruvian writer, with amazing memory and a great amount of humor, told how the extraordinary adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live the life of Alexandre developed from his passion for reading and his vocation to write.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added, "I don't think literature is just fun or a thrift-flower experience" because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to be held accountable for their vocation.
Pozoblanco’s farewell is shorter because of the harsh weather, and bullfights on horseback are also cancelled
Traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco holidays, the equestrian bullfight was cancelled from the show yesterday morning after prospective equestrian torreators found the arena unfit for the fight.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
The weather conditions were devastating, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was cancelled due to rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought the bulls of Castilblanco.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took three ears home as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante earned several accolades and an ear as a trophy through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
Then came El Juli, who made little contribution to the fame of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, we managed to get the majority of the audience out of the loop.
A truck carrying two tons of hash tried to escape from road traffic control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police carries out traffic controls in the administrative area of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities stop a van in which two passengers are travelling, and the passengers try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, at the same time, was not conspicuous.
Investigators pursued the passengers, and one, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Home Affairs Department said.
The man was charged with drug trafficking and forgery.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Control staff carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away on the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway towards a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its cargo of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
Hash bales that filled the rear of the vehicle were transported by the police to be subjected to a more thorough examination and measurement of the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the vehicle’s fake number plate does not match the data on the van’s papers, so the arrested person is also being prosecuted for forgery of a public document.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect who, as already mentioned, fled the highway, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A. A. J., was taken to the police station to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police over the weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
An eyewitness said he had attempted to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesman for the California traffic control agency told People magazine.
According to the eyewitness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear “push the gas to the floor, sobbing on the engine, trying to leave the parking lot forward and backward, and going backwards several times through his sunglasses.”
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was “concerned about Locklear’s life.”
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed confused," so the patrols took him to a drug and alcohol testing center.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately ruled out. The spokesperson also said that, according to the officers' first impression, it was believed that Locklear was under the influence of medication.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified substance, and was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for his anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, secretary general of the IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the unit’s regional federation will take a decision on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, former Youth and Sport Advisor to the Municipality of Seville. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to provide benefits to his family members.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this is certainly a matter for the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out to the party's procedure against a former member of the city council of Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that the detection of possible irregularities committed by Silva should be based on "transparency": "At IU has always advocated maximum transparency in such matters."
He added that the training includes “a strict code of ethics for civil servants.”
"Blood of May", Garci's epic work
Inspired by Benito Pérez’s National Episodes, José Luis Garci recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in May Blood, which, with a budget of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million, is the most grandiose work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis that the well-known novelist has always admired in his work, and Garci, in company with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, told a large audience of actors at the film’s premiere today.
Over two-and-a-half hours of Blood in May will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will screen it as a mini-series for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, made his childhood dream come true with this filming. All this is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him from the Province of Madrid three years ago to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events of 2 May in Madrid. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the story was based on the National Epi
The 15-million-dollar budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Community of Madrid and provided Garci with a special opportunity to present “the disoriented Spanish, who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge backwardness with the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
However, the director regretted not being able to count on the budget of the Phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, who had more than doubled the Blood of May, and was forced to omit a few scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is written with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director used his usual way of working, shooting the scenes with the actors he had already started rehearsals with before shooting. Casting was not, because Garci thinks it's "humiliating," and because, as he said, "the craft of directing is to go to the theatre and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry in which we work."
Many May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have not stepped in front of their cameras for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and one Oscar, believes that this year’s nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. Blood of May, Seven French billiard tables, and none of the finally selected Blind Sunflowers represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect awards with this movie.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for the future, and then you realize that it’s all about success, and in the end, you’re happy to have another movie,” Garci says with 30 years of professional career behind his back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Seville flamenco dancer commemorates a Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in oriental dance.
During her busy life, she fought for women’s equality as a pioneer, including Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that hindered women's freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution in war-torn Europe, her life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, she recommended Tortola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, from the "butterfly dance" to guajira, or from the "snake dance" to tango.
“He danced sensually and others think that’s what characterizes my style,” she says.
The performance is enhanced by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda singing again after the Open Door performance of Isabel, and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with one of her former students.
"Matilde plays the elder Tortola, the mature woman.
I’m happy that you said yes to the invitation, and I’m very honored that you’re performing in my play.”
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; percussionist El Pájaro, violinist Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a permanent character that is constantly besieging the real diva with his love."
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels through Europe and travels to distant lands at the time, including India, the United States and Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great influence on his own age, but nowadays his work is no longer known and even less appreciated," Bayón said.
The performance will begin tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will be published.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of two anniversary awards of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008).
In this way, the final chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-release of the said work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the memorial house of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Glossy Poplar".
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has collected a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the fame and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn't as attractive.
“God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.
The quote comes from Sally Field, an actress who worked with Newman in The Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and inertia that Newman's death caused in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was to win the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
He was known to be ill,
But still, everyone was shocked by his death.
“Sometimes it’s impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I’ve lost a good friend,” said Robert Redford in tears, “his existence has made my life and this country better.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or overwhelmed.
One of the heroes of cinema and the homeland passed away in a particularly dark period overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-esteem and a desperate quest for dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he was the embodiment of the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won causes, ranging from the anti-drug foundation in memory of his firstborn son who died of drug overdose to the creation of his home-made organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had difficulty transcending its suicidal eating culture.
A wave of overwhelming amazement traveled throughout Hollywood, regardless of nationality or origin.
The last James Bond, according to Daniel Craig, died not a man, but an era.
Another British Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today attempt to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: demanding honesty and serious privacy away from cameras.
It’s not always easy, if at all, in today’s media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He was divorced once, but then married faithfully to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, although he probably had many occasions to commit infidelity.
“Why should I eat a hamburger elsewhere when I have fried meat at home?” he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also your fans, which is not very common in America.
"None of her roles was as proud as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted philanthropist," she said.
The rugged road of the Olympics in Madrid
It is indeed the dream of many of us to have an Olympics in Madrid, and after 2012 has failed, it could be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we're starting from yesterday's race, I don't think so at all.
It was called the perfect race, but in my view it was the worst of many I’ve ever been to.
It was characterized by a bunch of nonsense, and if I had to be evaluated, and I was the examiner, it would definitely be a failure.
But let’s move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the receipt of the serial number, because this had to be arriving earlier.
That’s not a problem in itself, but if you’re going sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in a queue later).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first they gave me only the serial number (first pointless, that's why I'm going there sooner) and (after the usual line) how surprising, it was only an S-shirt (second pointless, since I'm in size XL)!
What world do we live in?
Or was it because of the crisis that they decided to save on the fabric and only buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dim compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that the chip had to be picked up awfully early, the queue took 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally did it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant to wait more than 40 minutes, which was filled with attempts of popular uprising and stand-attack.
I think about 500 of us will have pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, will not be able to get our seats with our actual time, because I assume my chip recorded the start incorrectly.
If you were to ask me about the perfect running race, of course, I wouldn’t think of that by any chance.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent - that can do some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle in the company's area) based on the information heard from the conversation.
This “receptionist” can use a camera and a form and face recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are — and even what clothes they wear — and to hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group attendees based on conversations.
In the video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company that is talking to her, nor is she an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to see someone and assures him that he will come to his aid soon.
All without the blue screen.
It's impressive.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have said that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial junk, computers would be five times faster — bravo, Steve, that’s something.
They invented the wax, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming increasingly relegated to the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step to become a competitor of Windows.
Many people have rightly realized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You have the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to face the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer’s statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less overwhelming, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and ultimately be an alternative to Google.
You need it, and I’ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo at a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the vending machine, a poster tells them to use the company's browser. "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not come in early 2009, but in the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
Mobile phones are increasingly becoming computers.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely spoil their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, by Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and by Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, and it was also one of the basic outfits for a massive gay audience.
Speaking of the specialties, we can also recall the peaceful figure of the skate-muscled weightlifter of the travelling circus.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than the - typically tight and sleeveless - men's cotton jersey.
That is, the "tank", as the Anglophones call it, but none of its rivals can compete with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is often referred to as "Marcel" among friends - which he owes to the sport, legend has it that Marcel Cerdan is named after the boxer, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel stands out from the competition for its excellent cotton fabric, unisex cut, distinctive emblem and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag. The latter is hidden in the neck of the t-shirt by the most typical models.
But the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen pants, nautical t-shirts, baby clothes, mini-suits - and so on - all belong to the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
It’s also unfortunate that they have to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
At the moment, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling is more than just a few pretty girls naming her.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the award ceremony of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It emanates an overwhelming warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We are presenting the new autumn-winter collection of Mango, which I designed with my brother Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second competition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a pretty busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we took a lot of things from there.
And then, a lot of the time, I just go around the city and watch women, how they dress, how they change and choose their clothes – this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer.
I think so too, but after all, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
Even as a child, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s and peek into my aunt’s wardrobe.
Well, that was you in Canaan, almost like an amusement park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dressed.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals so we have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you fall into lethargy?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think that's when women really mature, they're experienced enough, and they make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn’t worry me.
I’ve been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that brings me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I was born a woman and I want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss this.
And as for the future father, it doesn't matter who it is.
I want to raise my child with great love and happiness.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, you made a lot of movies last year that haven't been shown yet.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in theatre, am very impatient and anxious, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that it is impossible.
I can't wait to see The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
Naomi Campbell, I have known her for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization, Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned and the proceeds were donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much being said about him, well, I know him, and I can assure you that's not half the story.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I would.
When the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I don't know anything impossible.
Recurring drunk drivers will be forced to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving offences, the Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, which says the pilot project will last for a year.
As the aim of the project is to reintroduce traffic, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Transportation Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) are participating in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers who have been arrested for drunk driving on multiple occasions are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the inhaled air. If it is higher than the permitted level, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument worth more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 would be borne by the offender.
A study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives each year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from turning into criminal offences,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is taking place in the usual course, while the necessary reform of the criminal law would require an amendment of the Fundamental Law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in pilot mode in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, on the French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico in Closed Shoes
At 5:40 p.m. at the time announced in the program, the Spanish Air Force's Prince of Asturias Air Force aircraft landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was going down, but it was still so tight that we could only see the royal pair disembarking from the plane using our hands as a blind.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish Ambassador and other distinguished personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Ducal Couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
All right, well, there won't be any airport transfers for a while today... she's from around here or something.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish. She just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, I mean...
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Asturias Princely Couple and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, a barricade of 27 marines who protect the dignitaries.
The Duke appears, smiling, dressed in sea blue, and then the Duchess, in her long hair, with the wind, in modest clothing, but not in the usual shoes that flash her toes, perhaps warned that Mexico City was in danger of a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the room, where the official reception follows.
At the gates of their hotel, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a reporter on Mexican television is waiting for them.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The best place in the world to hold a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest fashion designer today is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards competition, which aims to internationally introduce young talent in the fashion industry.
The main prize is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own-designed clothes at the Mango window of the boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris, and she almost cried.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
In the midst of numerous events and thanks to Valentino for presiding over the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango for the gala dinner looked even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness after the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking ornaments of ELAH. She accompanied Valentin to the main table in her honor with her son Luis, who was almost two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests, who, along with Baron Rotchil, were so chivalrous that they were left without a suit, which they each gave to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design trousers and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During the night’s opera visit to Gaya Toledo’s company in the ballet hall, she became so enthusiastic that recalling the old days, she slipped to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie look.
Inés Sastre did not attend the visit to the palace, but first she showed me some photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we had the opportunity to see Oliver Martinez, who is about two meters tall and rides a motorcycle, and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, bringing his own sheets and towels, and telling us in advance that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
There are not 1,000, but 1,000 and one ways to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that you can find them all in a single book, which will arrive at the bookstores on September 30th, to bring the peace of mind with you.
It’s almost tortured to ring the clock at 7:00 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast-paced the world today is forcing you to live every day.
The name of the office is stress, and the name of the computer is back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two ways to cope with daily exhaustion and bridge problems at work.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that suits their best and can be adapted to their free moments.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 method of relaxation and the calmness that flows from it comes to the bookshops from the publisher Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
In addition, it also offers other ideas that can help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central issue in your life, it’s time to sit back in the chair, relax and concentrate on reading.
Those Who Speak in Dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean the ones who wake up and fully awake and tell what happened to them that day, but the ones who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that you spoke at night.
Its frequency can be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a high fever illness) or more regular (every day, weekly or monthly), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night awakenings, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, a condition with high fever, or even a stress or an increased state of excitement, may be accompanying phenomena.
It has been little studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, consisting of inconsistent words, murmuring, but in contrast, it can also manifest itself in the form of shouting, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is a problem that is causing great anxiety and thus it may offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, and consequently, there is no cure for it unless it is associated with another form of sleep disorder that can be treated (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things you can do, here are some preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose relaxing games and avoid your child watching fear-inspiring or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to relax are taught some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help your child sleep more peacefully.
If you start talking while you sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be useless, because the child would be out of consciousness, but he would be out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if repeatedly severe anxiety accompanies the phenomenon, it is advisable to consult a specialist or find out what triggers the child’s high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarer case), do not start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It would be superfluous anyway, since you are not conscious enough to gather your thoughts while you sleep.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the associated dream images, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and any conclusions you may have.
Never tell a child that they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This is causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as this is just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally the Illhaeusern
After a long dive, the Illhaeusern team finally regained momentum and won again at home.
Although it was not a spectacular match, the yellow-black teams were put in a position several times, of which they were able to use one to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot to the gate was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeusern came to the top, and the shots followed one another: Fonderflick tried to defend himself with a distant shot.
On the other side, the players defended in a block in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after this, the first goal was scored: The Marais of Illhaeusern scored the ball after Diebold's first shot, and then he placed it in the goal (53rd minute).
However, the scorer of Ilhausern did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the pitch, so his teammates had to continue the fight with a human handicap.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when, after a lot of haste, the ball got very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
A demonstration held by fishermen on Monday paralysed the traffic in several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided on Tuesday morning to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter pledged to welcome the president "in a constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals."
The president's visit coincides with a meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of diesel oil, as the oil price exceeded the record average price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the president of the Republic, said the president would "negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make seafarers' working conditions and wages safer."
The fishermen are looking forward to the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, resulting in nearly 10 km of congestion.
The port of Quiberon was also paralysed, but the roads to Belle-Ile were not blocked.
The Quiberon Peninsula has roadblocks.
On Monday, seafarers had already demonstrated their determination: at dawn, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of fuel warehouses in Brest ports, while demonstrations were taking place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further protests in other ports on the Atlantic coast and in the Channel. For example, in Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée department, fishermen did not board, while in Le Havre some twenty ships hindered the traffic of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique department lifted the blockade of the huge Total refinery in the Dongs in the evening.
But the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday for a meeting at the ministry.
In Le Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to decide on Tuesday its next step and participation in a meeting scheduled for the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "the fishermen will not give in to their demands" and "will not go to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the only way to make a ship profitable would be to lower the price of diesel below <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
The Wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has died at the age of 83 from cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the global crisis, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is expected to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
In the past eight years, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG sells more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, an insurance company that has been rebuilt by U.S. financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the <0x24>85 billion in advance, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times reported.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance business, AIG would lose most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine sales opportunities.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG plans to sell include the company’s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly obtain liquid assets to repay a loan of <0x24>85 billion approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk of having to divest up to 80% of its capital and losing shareholders in proportion to that.
Paris Historica’s study of the historic Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank bailout plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points), while the Nasdaq declined by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 to 10 365.45.
The largest drop in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technology papers, closed with a drop of 199.61 at 1,983.73 points, while the expanded index of Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 dropped by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weakened at the time of opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank bailout plan to restore the market balance, it went downhill.
The MEPs voted 228 against 205, refusing to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
The plan was rejected by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
“The market has taken the wrong signals because Congress seems to be unable to approve a plan,” Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial, said in a statement.
"This shows how much the market was expecting this plan," he said, expressing concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed (...) it will be up to the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will tighten further," warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have ensured that Wachovia’s banking business will be acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "has not only developed an American, but a global crisis," adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has recovered significantly.
The yield on 10-year government bonds fell from 3.827 % to 3.632 % on Friday evening, while the yield on 30-year-old bonds fell from 4.357 % to 4.161 % on the previous day.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would win the duel.
Not surprisingly, Republican and Democrat campaigners alike claimed the victory in a television duel that was watched by a third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen said John McCain’s performance was “respectable” but “not impressive enough” to halt the decline in popularity, according to surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: a poll published on Saturday showed Obama had a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%, respectively).
Among the most calculating, still indefinite voters, 39% say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey by CBS.
President Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party’s party partner Joseph Biden’s promising performance on Thursday, preparing for Biden’s first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton warned: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
You have good instincts."
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to highlight his own, undoubtedly enormous, foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent's "naiveness" on these issues, which were at the heart of his first personal meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand...” the attack was repeated.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that has been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama insists that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was clear and precise.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does," a Democratic ad aired this weekend said, blaming the Republican leader for not assessing the impact of the crisis on the American "street people."
"In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina for an election meeting in the rain.
The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, whom Americans consider to be the most capable of saving an economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could prove to be a turning point,” Senator Charles Schumer said.
Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had “as great instincts in the economic field” as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict on the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois Senator has reaffirmed that despite stock market fluctuations, it will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, adding that its primary goals include building the country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and developing a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously avoided questions about the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bank bailout plan: the highly unpopular plan was passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: “Have you noticed that an election was taking place here?”
Young people and opposition protesters on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words: 'Mr. Dictator, resign!'.
Some people admit that they haven’t even gone to vote, “Why would I have gone? They’ll do what they want with my vote anyway!” says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to make itself visible to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were declared clean by observers, sanctions against the country could be lifted, which included denying visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing some bank accounts.
However, the opposition said the elections were not clear.
“We were kept away from election committees and our observers were not allowed to take part in the ballot count,” Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for a very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition, said.
"The changes were purely nominal," said Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The main thing is who counts the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, that means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to have a place on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take a stand in political life, because “it is necessary to initiate a dialogue with the European Union”.
If our heavily indebted economy with Russia is in crisis and we are unable to renew ourselves, we risk falling under the control of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems to be too high and that the widespread organisation of preliminary voting (in which 26% of the voters participated in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
“Have you noticed that elections were taking place here?” asks social democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, who was the last person to be released from prison in August this year as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
There will be no more than five members of the opposition in the parliament, namely those who are best suited to the leadership.
On October Square the silence of the night is once again overshadowed.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission rejoice.
The blood is safe again.
President Dr Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate today, because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world.
And most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was severely shattered by the 1980s and 1990s contaminated blood scandal.
As is well known, national blood reserves managed by the Blood Service of the Red Cross of Canada were infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, in February 1994, the Canadian government, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched a formal investigation to clarify the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to formulate recommendations to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed the submission of his report, some provinces set up their own committees to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee was responsible for this task.
The Gelineau and Krever reports resulted in the establishment of two blood supply services in Canada: the Hema-Quebec, which serves Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Supply Society, which is responsible for supplying all the other provinces and two territories.
“When Hema-Quebec began its operations in 1998, less than 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we were able to regain people's confidence." Décary proudly announces that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec already considered Hema-Quebec to be trustworthy.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that “trust is an extremely fragile thing.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has applied the principle of caution.
It was during this period that many cases of goose disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was transmitted by blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are unsure about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we need to apply exclusion measures. In this case, we were talking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain lesions, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
And a few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease was spreading through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that makes it possible to diagnose HIV more sensitively. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus itself directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies that were formed against the virus, on which the tests used earlier were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which takes from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical equipment, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk of unknowingly infecting the bloodstream by blood donors and preventing it from being detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
In other words, it means that we need to distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone would become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I believe that anyone can now safely accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, says the head of Hema-Quebec.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what kind of new pathogen will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood by insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on the lookout,” Dr. Décary continued, stressing that, in addition to emergency reserves, Hema-Quebec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“With the ageing of the population, demands are increasing.
Because cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has an impact on the blood donor population, as the number of people eligible for blood donation in the network accounts for only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, every healthy person aged at least 18 years who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is devastating do not have the right to donate blood for a year.
“We have 3% reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare that we run out of supplies.
The number of blood donors, on the other hand, must be increased as the existing ones age, because after a while they will no longer be able to donate blood.
However, it is very difficult to persuade people to donate blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
“In today’s fast-paced world, you have barely an hour to go and donate blood,” Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Héma-Quebec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then deposited at the Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once treated only as medical waste, can be used to extract blood that is rich in stem cells, thus allowing for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we received the 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample in our bank, and we plan to take more than 1,000 new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering these for organ transplants,” explained Dr. Décary, who says that the umbilical cord blood collection program is very popular nowadays.
"Many mothers are saddened that they don't have the opportunity to do this," this is indeed the case, as Hema-Quebec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifiers and reached the semi-finals with a total score of 4:3. This was the second and most crucial match of the quarter-finals, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
Antonio Ribeiro scored the final goal in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went by without a goal, in the second half two Montreal midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, were in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one from the Sounders who managed to eliminate goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Let’s remember that in his first match on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact plays in the semi-finals with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder, which lost 3:1 to Whitecaps in the first game, won 4:3, but Whitecaps made it to the semi-finals with a 5:4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but match details will be clarified later today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
Canada's favorite trias is ready for the next season.
A triple made by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and in the end the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers with a 3:2 penalty shot last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the team's number one star, scored a goal. Plekanec scored two goals, and Kovalev scored a goal pass, which was the fourth of the team's six preparation games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
"I need another game to really feel in shape."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first trimester," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He had a huge ovation.”
Charest's Northern Aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Soon after the Liberal Party’s meeting, Jean Charest travelled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is seeking victory in today’s interim election.
"Removing our last great northern border": this is the ambitious long-term goal Jean Charest set at the Liberal Party meeting held yesterday in Lévis, Quebec. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the President tried to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back, images similar to "Moulin à images" were projected.
The three giant projectors were followed by impressive images: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are usually used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his timetable was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for the future of Quebec, embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at 49<0xC2><0xB0> latitude) has often been featured in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on the subject before.
However, the Head of State merely explained why he considered the North to be a “treasure mine full of tremendous opportunities”, but did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: primarily hydroelectric power plants, forestry and mining in particular, further stimulated by the growth of catching-up countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
In the north, it's "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is “twice the size of France,” is “our territory, the territory of Quebec.”
It’s not just in us, it’s in us,” the Head of State reiterated, stressing that with it he wants to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by its connection to the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec’s design work, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, also includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed for itself, the prime minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “we also need to rethink our view of the North in the light of climate change,” the Prime Minister said, referring to the Northwest Passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, occupying the territory in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
What about the indigenous peoples of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially to young people.
The two ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate of the Parti Québécois in ungava) have already started consultations with about thirty local communities.
The interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister of Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role, was also established.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” where “a common vision is created”.
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nordic Plan will be coordinated, systemic and at the same time environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the election of Jean Lesage as party president.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Quebec, Lesage, the silent revolution and the nationwide deployment of hydropower, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another - true, conservative - work, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the design of the dam for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest highlighted that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This should remain between us, but I plan to be there," he told his supporters, and his statement was received with a loud thunderstorm of applause.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he took on duties at the Chinese Federal Council meeting and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. This is mainly about "constitutional endeavours": the liberal party demands recognition of the "special nature of Quebec" in particular in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The head of Coastal Québecois, Paulina Marois, reopened the North Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
Had they not done so, "we would have made a lot of progress today," said Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was nominated for the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s approval of the Northern Plan.
"But we want it to be more than an act," said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who was returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Harper Cabinet Secretary Vic Toews took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbour “the shame” of Canada.
To slander a woman who has fought unceasingly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is, therefore, our government, which, among the Western countries concerned, alone did not return its own national from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was charged with.
It is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and allowed a child soldier to die in inhumane conditions.
The only government that turns justice into a puppet theatre while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Let us just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association are also demanding that Omar Khadr be repatriated so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it doesn’t matter to him that a young adult has already been mentally destroyed, and many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
"Democracy": Harper keeps uttering this word, which sounds like an empty word out of his mouth.
So the time has come when morals no longer exist: arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned any Canadian citizen at the will of the leader of a government that has so far been in the minority (and what can come after October 14...?).
Many electors believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order, but they do not see that this government is treading on the values that have given our country its good name and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is this rather than looking elsewhere.
The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President and CEO of Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
Garver says the world’s largest gold-producing company has filed a <0x24>6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small-scale publishing company in order to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in defamation cases, are made not on the basis of the truth, but on the basis of the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, is it really the best way to debate publicly that you destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums on defense and struggle in an unequal battle between a host of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, the tactic is often used to destroy the defendant and to reach a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposing parties, but even intimidates those who would try to tackle the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, he would have preferred to have expressed his views in public.
While in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is not the case, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually don’t hit each other with a stick, but rather express their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, and publications, paying independent research teams that could have shed light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn’t trust the public, and with a single gesture, he sweeps away petitions and letters to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how you can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, you disregard the opinion of this public?
In the vice-president’s head, this word probably only refers to the bush-paid lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus narrowed.
In a democratic state, even detractors of others have the right to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand – or does not want to understand – that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mostly supported by the public because they condemn the mine’s harsh conduct.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than in a lawsuit to silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", by the way, Barrick Gold recently wrote to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using that term.)
Beyond Garver’s surrealistic arguments, Barrick Gold’s prosecution openly attacks the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is only possible to study and discuss subjects that do not please the wealthy companies of today, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have long been able to handle disputes, disagreements and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's ill-considered conduct demonstrates that, contrary to his claim, he has no desire to engage in open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally put in place measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on an economic rescue operation, the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The <0x24>700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has raged on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by two Houses of Congress.
The key points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by MEPs; new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized for lack of payment; and the right of access to the salaries of managers of assisted companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Congressman Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
“Everything we did was to save the real economy and American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Congressman Judd Gregg.
The negotiation was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investors’ mood.
You have been given a deadline for the agreement until the stock market opens this morning.
The two presidential candidates, who joined the negotiations late, showed willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed no satisfaction that the situation had escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed to himself the extension of the agreement to include elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of home ownership or the salary of executives of state-assisted companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, that’s not very welcome.
These steps, however, are necessary," he noted in an American television program.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, “I would like to know the details, but I hope I do.”
"What I have read in large lines shows that it is something that we all have to digest and through which we can move on.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan is to use taxpayers’ money to buy the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions and some of their risky, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month-long crisis, triggered by the explosion of the real estate balloon, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid resources and the turmoil of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was overturned by a group of Republican MPs last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end, since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty should be secured by the government rather than bought.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, the plan included a provision stating that if the government has to bear losses under the program for five years, it can levy new taxes to recover its funds.
As part of the new plan, a <0x24>250 billion instalment would first be paid, followed by an additional <0x24>100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining <0x24>350 billion would have to be approved by Congress through a second vote.
In exchange for aid, Washington acquires a stake in the subsidised companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits and can sell them after the crisis has eased.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure of the real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and will also be able to set a maximum amount of wages and indemnities for the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters would like the plan to be approved by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there were repeated statements against the plan, both among Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington is not listening to your voice," Scott Garrett, a member of the House's finance committee, said.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
There is nothing that will benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic representative of a small congressional group called the "skeptical faction," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path they take,” Sherman said.
In Europe, at the same moment, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French firm BNP Paribas announced that it would not acquire its bankruptcy competitor after losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million (USD 2.9 billion) as a result of the US subprime mortgage crisis.
Fortis, with 85,000 employees, is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not a waste of money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we will acquire the right to vote and influence in the bank.
That’s exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be precarious.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which the real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US<0x24>75.5 billion).
Spain’s Santander bank announced yesterday that it will acquire the UK bank’s subsidiaries and clients.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor
Her beautiful azure eyes were, according to some, her main strength, while others thought her main weakness.
Has the charming American actor ever got rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yeah, and I don't.
Because of his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far removed from the noisy style that is the very essence of the great monsters of the art world.
What a huge course he has run!
Paul Newman died Friday of lung cancer at the age of 83 on his property in Connecticut, one of the last icons of American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, who resembled him, and who for a long time was his rival on the screen. In his roles, he was more modest and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
From the mixing of blood often come extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American Dream.
He didn’t think too much about himself, which only enhanced his merit.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York, before exploding into theatre, television, and soon after cinema.
In 1979, he won second place in the 24 Hours of Le Mans as a race driver, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know what the shadows of this mysterious, closed-minded, devoted actor, who hated the glitter of show-business, were, will forever remain a mystery.
He was an honest man in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death this week has shocked cinema fans: his big roles can only be seen on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his life’s work, the seventh American art, cinema, has been constantly changing for more than fifty years.
We remember the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man disconnected from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation of "The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof".
Lately (1990) he is remembered in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age as he finds that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman has many other faces in his films.
Robert Wise's "Someone Up There" featured an unforgettable portrayal of the turbulent criminal-boxer Rocky Graziano, a role originally intended for James Dean, and taken over after his death, as Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film The Big Bang, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
Robert Rossen played a bitter, vengeful billiard player in his brilliant film The Scammer (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film The Color of Money.
Times change, but it's always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by periods of change.
Younger people are mostly known for George Roy Hill's cult movie "Icebreakers" (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey team coach.
His fans saw him in The Big Jump, written by the Coen Brothers, in 1994.
Sam Mendes’ 2003 film The Way to Doom was the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen fairly soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glitter, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier did not, without all the humor, view it as a "live refutation of underplay": he thought his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always gracious to handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time fell into the lap of film roles.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he played characters on the margins of society – neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless – whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect credibility.
As a director, he showed a lesser-known face of Newman: a truly shy and sensitive man in the depths of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted from the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he and his wife Joanne Woodward portrayed a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
In a 1984 film, Harry and his Son, which shows restraint and sadness, he commemorates his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's countless admirers remembered the actor, and his close friend and old warrior companion Robert Redford (who played with him in "The Big Bang" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have now lost.
Alongside his legendary career, he is blurred by his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and his criticism of Hollywood’s debauchery.
Many times we saw his image smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a pretty bad taste in the mouth, although at the beginning he still thought it funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to its foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all the time.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote: “Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai’s invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, which have been committed in a criminal organisation on a regular and commercial basis and have caused particularly significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the winning grants were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often proved by false accounts.
The state and local government funds – about HUF 65 million in total – were partly transferred to the Young Left Party’s treasury and partly to the pockets of certain individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the winning grants were drawn on the basis of expense invoices, which were not backed by real performance, and the associations never fulfilled the commitments they had made.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, the invoice blocks were purchased in the market of Józsefváros, and the circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And on which companies the invoice production should take place, it was decided, among other things, on the Balaton Uplands boulevard, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, it was supposed to look like bed and breakfasts and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption there, which was modelled on the invoices to be submitted for applications from the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of Budapest, among others.
Most of these were noted by István Lados and his partner András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados's "study trips" was a beerhouse.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of ninety members of the Színg Pont Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to fit into the catering facility at the same time.
In the same way, the invoice issued to the Foundation for a Better Future, later called Together for the Third Millennium, in the summer of 2002, was full of errors in form and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn’t sleep in it in one night, yet the bill was for a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative forms-fillers were overwhelmed even when they marked Pigal Kft., which is also a hospitality company, whose books – according to the information given to the prosecution – did not include the documents for a Better Future and the name of Oops.
The head of the company, Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor’s office and invoices were presented to him, he knew immediately that the documents were fake.
"On the stamp, the name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place."
He added that besides the formal reasons, it was not correct that according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, since they have a total of eleven rooms that do not have enough space.
In addition, the bill was for catering, even though their restaurant had been shut down for a long time.
The zealous invoicers did not investigate the fact that the travel agency they looked at in Budapest only organises trips abroad, so they marked the trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not correspond to the company’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, the document also included VAT, although the travel activities to countries outside the European Union were exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the VAT rate was incorrect on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to Better Future, as the company’s services are charged not the indicated 25 percent but 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel’s employees only issued a machine invoice, but the manufactured invoice was manual.
In addition, the “exhibitors” also corrupted the invoice by marking road freight transport as an activity carried out in the case of a company, which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, not a real stamp - the invoices for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the Cultural Association of the 21st century and the Commissioner Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was being liquidated at the time (2001) when the group of the Association for the Young City was eating there, so the company’s liquidator – as far as we know – denied that he had issued the paper.
They were consciously
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left Party - Young Socialists, the Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice to the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, persuaded the head of Collab Ltd. to issue a fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 supplied the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association with invoices worth roughly five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Nor is there any movement of money, because the completed invoices were dismantled afterwards, but the organizations forgot to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that are related to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade and is based in Budapest, although it is not located there.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer devices in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were bought by Kiskunhalasi Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have forwarded documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
It is believed that during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he issued an invoice on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hoppa and the Foundation for the Third Millennium, and he accepted their consideration.
Specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operating, which the defendant said was because they did not get a job.
At the request of his co-accused lawyer, Zsolt Szente, who also made the papers of the company’s foundations, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations affiliated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office said that 10 percent of the bills and VAT hit Kubatov.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the tender of the Commissioner Point.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), a non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the funds were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found during a search at <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at the education department.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor’s office, will probably report on the process of invoice production.
It may be most interesting if you are the first accused, János Zuschlag, who decides to lift the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether the socialists have made a deal with him for the compensation of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
By the way, he may have been offended today, as his requests to ease the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, have constantly fallen on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more harm and do not compensate for it can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, they are not allowed to do so.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Do We Spend More Money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers from the University of New York in neuroscience and economics.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose out in a type of competition like eBay’s auction, so they tend to pay too high a price.
The study attempted to map the neurological scheme of this "play" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took part in a lottery and the other group participated in a game auction while using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the active brain areas of the subjects.
Both games allowed participants to win money, but during the auction game, in which an essential element is the overbidding of the other party, the subcortical complex called striatum became active intensively when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, among many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economist members of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product in question was, and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they got out of the game, they would be rewarded with an additional <0x24>15.
The third group received <0x24>15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group also lost that money.
The only difference between the two groups was that they emphasized winning for one group and losing for the other.
Proving the neurologists' hypothesis, however, the members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than both the control and the "winning" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of winning and risk avoidance.
Only neurological imaging techniques have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis at home is estimated to be 100,000, but only seven thousand are being treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a common name for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, are characterized by hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (for example, with infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should be protected by vaccination against A and B viruses, but there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea.
After this, yellowing appears on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stools are light, the urine turns dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to carry out early prevention and regular screening tests.
Three groups have significantly more than average cases of this disease: people who had had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and people who had tattoos.
The number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected, it is worth consulting a general practitioner.
When the disease is detected in time, it can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating the infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, which was first held in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
It aims to raise awareness of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
If you believe in God, it hurts less.
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which may have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how God-belief affects people’s perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electrocuted while all of them were studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The study was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkling device to the subject's left hand, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look vigorously at two paintings, The Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and The Lady with Hermelin painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes while either watching the religious theme or the overall picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as if they were "cared for" and "calmed, filled with peace."
When viewing a religious-themed picture, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who participated in the study himself, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even in atheists, just the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture of someone who feels very positively about them, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the search.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases does change our personality,” Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo, or a painter of a similar caliber, showed the believers a picture of a Madonna, what effect would that have on their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you that people have it in their pockets as much as they have in the sky; they know where they’ve been on vacation, what they’re going to and what they’re interested in.
And that’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s main employees.
As for the skeptics who parallel the Orwellian horror, they don’t see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep up with the original goal of Google’s founders, which was to “systematize all the information in the world.”
According to Google, the company is still in the early stages of managing all the information after 10 years of globally disruptive work.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What kind of work would I really do?”, but until then, software won’t be able to answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that when searching on the Internet, search words are recorded exactly from which IP address they searched for them and to which page they went after searching.
With the Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surf history, look back at what they’ve been looking for, what they’ve clicked on, and in the long run, it will generate much more personalized results for them – based on the same logic that Recommendations will use to offer us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at what I do? – asks users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the feeling of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power, triggering counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched terms are not only recorded, but can also be passed on to third parties if justified, in such legal cases the privacy of internet users is not protected by anything.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the paedophiles from its social network, Orkut.
However, internet users concerned about privacy could sigh back in May when the company, in conjunction with the EFF, successfully proved its right in court against the FBI: according to these, Google should not be forced by any of the constitutional provisions to disclose any information the FBI has secretly requested.
(At the same time, the federal government was successful in tackling some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained by referring to the ratification of the Child Protection Act, which had been passed years ago, but failed to obtain search lists of individual users and a complete list of websites and keywords for two months.)
Google’s perception is therefore rather contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy is being compromised by using Google’s services and acting against them with a riot that has to be imposed on multinationals that are shining in the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wildness of enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists, and users in many countries sees in them the next generation of big corporations, the "cool corporation", unlike its rival, Microsoft, a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google doesn’t ask users for identification codes, it doesn’t ask for money for apps, and open, free, and constantly updated source code and software packages seem much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant practice.
However, it may also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the internet, which has been followed by one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaborating, about deliberately leaving tracks and exploiting the channels of communication available to us, and while these vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can manage profiles on multiple social networks from Facebook to Xanga, link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm, listing their music habits, and connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
While we read about a number of exemplary cases from which it emerges: the girlfriend can easily figure out who her cheating friend spent the evening with, or she can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on top management in her blog: one thing is certain, the notion of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
Anyone who lives an online life consists of what he shows himself, and that is the basis behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google’s search engine but not intentionally leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who don’t intentionally sign up for social networks so that they can’t be found can be replaced with alternative versions of Google’s online apps, from text editors to image managers and news readers, which aren’t tied to huge server parks and don’t make up the best profile we’ve ever had.
Public opinion isn’t so secretly waiting for Google to show off its teeth.
With a current value of <0x24>156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening revenues for advertising agencies, and the fast-paced roll-out of services is causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, find counterpoints that seem disturbing: for example, the senior management completely rejected employees’ protests after they doubled the company’s kindergarten fee, the management found it too expensive to feed the employees arbitrarily many times a day for Chinese interests, but all of this is undermined by the fact that Google was still trying to reach an agreement with the Chinese government in 2006.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they will not announce a new service in advance until it is available for use, but surely, the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google’s medical scanning and archiving project has taken such scale from our previous problems to our health care system, and others have taken it from our previous ones, that the company will soon have to the US Supreme Court of Justice.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide good material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel Scroogled describes a future in which a person can only be approached with alarming Orwellian overtones from Google data.
Two young people helped the dual killer in <0xC3><0x93>zd
Two minors were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, and there is a reasonable suspicion that they helped to cover the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people admitted to the offense and are currently being accused of complicity.
The two young men - two girls, according to the MTI, are defending themselves at large.
Complicity can be punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old local man - was placed in custody on Sunday.
Premeditated, for profit, suspected of multiple homicide.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to an Ozd site last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign of this is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the conditions of its use are investigated by the police with the help of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Purchase Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million (about CZK 5 billion) to buy a 100-percent stock package from the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from being a potential new owner of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the securities within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the offer from the Poles represents the highest amount that interested parties have offered for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Viennese stock exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
Prague Stock Exchange chief Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among interested parties, and did not rule out the possibility that this could lead to the extinction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion kroons.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90% of the securities could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
Leading European newspapers on Tuesday, devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, have already mentioned “September 11th”.
The global financial disaster is due to the US President, accused by the Roman newspaper La Repubblica, who has not even been able to line up his own party behind a swiftly assembled bill aimed at remedying the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but the congressional vote threatened Washington with failing to provide a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can provide a bailout for the struggling financial institutions, and use taxpayers’ money to save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither funds nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was given to failing financial institutions, Der Standard of Vienna recalls, according to which the concerns that, like Americans, European taxpayers have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The “ambulances” do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good to state: in which cases it is reasonable to use taxpayers’ money in order to prevent more damage.
The flight of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop collision avoidance technologies, if not by imitating obstacle detectors that occur in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the dwarf bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C, a bio-imitation automotive robotic control system, a robotized mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to design a system that eliminates all collisions.
"While flying, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective shell," Kazuhhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand, explained at the exhibition.
The role of the complex eye of the uterus is important, which can see in all directions at an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the complex eye function, the engineers turned to the idea of a laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 meters at 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately converts into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is detected in a fraction of a second, and the car robot immediately changes direction by turning its wheels as much as is necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver is carried out entirely instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the car-robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
You need to react in an inspiring and immediate way, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective shell, a layer within which a collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
However, in a way other than bees, the deviation cannot be upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the turnability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to bypass other bees, only rotary motion and acceleration, as well as deceleration, were used here as available options for the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you will constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate evasion technology, which Nissan estimates will enter production within ten years.
Additional applications include integrating the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system to drive the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It's called the poisonous child.
A written version of the <0x24>700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act, which will be used in several instalments to buy bad loans from banks, has been prepared.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
During further talks, which will last until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders have reached an agreement on a <0x24>700 billion bailout that has lasted for days, Reuters said.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The compromise was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the chariot of the economy around.
A written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. (Central European Time, 2 a.m.), but it did not cause a spectacular rush to the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft economic emergency stabilisation law of 2008 on the programme, and then the Senate will vote on the bill.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening and welcomed news of the deal at the White House.
“We are satisfied with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the <0x24>700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the <0x24>700 billion will be spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday, from which the Treasury Department will buy loan-backed, badly rated securities, and the fate of another <0x24>100 billion will depend on the president’s decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, including the Federal Reserve president.
The other half of the 700 billion will be subject to a new Congressional resolution.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans at the same time.
The purchases can be made through auctions and directly, the ministry’s officials said.
The legislation will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial ministry guarantees the instruments of concern, for which the companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said: “The law provides the necessary means to provide up to <0x24>700 billion for the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s buying bad assets on a large scale, insuring them, or avoiding the systemic risk of a large financial institution collapsing.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid can count on the government to limit their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a gold parachute.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys through auctions, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute, unless the levied bank chief is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managerial money is not exaggerated.
As part of the picture, the existing gold parachute contracts remain unchanged, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire shares in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the transaction once the economy and, with it, the rescued bank have recovered.
The bill stipulates that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a bill to Congress setting out how to return expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayers' dollars," Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were pushed by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices of industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports the HCSO.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
As a result of the domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of industry increased only 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a 4.6 per cent increase in the monthly price of bags and straps, and a 2.5% increase in the monthly price of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
Prices fell in the sectors of petroleum processing (1.4%), electrical machinery and instrumentation (0.9%) and - to a minimum extent - wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In other manufacturing sectors, we measured price increases between 0.2% and 0.9%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which have a significant weight in the domestic sales of industry, increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the transient effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
Prices in the petroleum processing sector increased the most in terms of domestic sales in the manufacturing sector (32.4%) compared to the twelve-month period.
In the manufacturing of metal products, the price of food, beverages and tobacco, representing the dominant weight, rose by 13.2 percent and 11 percent respectively.
The fall in prices occurred in the textiles, textile goods (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
Domestic sales showed the biggest monthly price increase (0.7%) in the sectors producing investment goods in August.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices grew by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and downstream industries, prices remained unchanged from the previous month.
Compared to the same month of the previous year, the biggest price increase was observed in August 2008 in the energy and downstream sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sector, the price increased by 6.8 per cent and in the investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industry in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 per cent in 12-month comparisons.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar in one month, and by 7.5 percent against the euro and by 15.9 percent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Do you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January – the foreign minister spoke about this in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community in Chicago.
In his opinion, “nearly everything now depends on the timely establishment of an electronic access control system overseas”.
At the same time, he pointed out that there will be no travel authorisation under the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is currently in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Hungarian Order of Merit Central Cross will confer with the Star and hold talks with Barack Obama’s Democratic and Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s foreign policy advisers.
Barack Obama and McCain are on the side of the bank bailout
Both Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, said they supported the government’s <0x24>700 billion bank bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon talks, representatives of Congress and administration announced Sunday morning that they had reached a principled agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at freezing the frozen credit market have become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain have said they are more capable than their rivals of pulling the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama has once again gained some advantage, melting McCain’s advantage after the Republican Convention, with Sarah Palin’s nomination as Vice President.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the bill on the <0x24>700 billion package would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer protection clauses that he also supported.
“We must act now, with responsibility (...) your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the whole economy are at risk,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC: "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing this, but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican Senator said the proposal included setting up a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the severance pay of top executives, he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, but was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.
The German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp voters have become more self-aware – thus Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, the Bavarian revolution devours its fathers, analyzes the causes of the CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also a problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was almost exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party was abolished.
In 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent for the first time since the 1950s, below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the CSU’s consistent modernization of the province, which eats up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in the pace. However, the secularization, educational achievements and the establishment of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for CSU’s loyalty to the electorate.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are also visible.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters became more self-aware, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also noteworthy that in recent weeks the classical civic groups have been the most distant from the CSU; liberals, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper article "Who with whom? The party chairmen on the restrained coalition issues" deals with the turbulent domestic political situation that arose after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders barely gave a glimpse into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in social partnerships.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current <0xC3><0x96>VP President as Vice Chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
There is no question of repeating this direction.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party elects the opposition or joins the coalition is, for the time being, completely open in the party, issues must necessarily be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President Jörg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> has repeatedly shown openness in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, which this year is hosted by the French Presidency of the European Union, has begun today in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, drew attention to educational segregation, as this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children, and it is also the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights defenders and NGOs in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
Járóka warned – according to the press office of the Fidesz MEP group – that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have a secondary education and only a minority of them have access to higher education because of poor basic education."
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children can help to strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections in the widest range - also among Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market increase; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
“Roma must have the right to a quality education on the basis of their European citizenship, and the elimination of their low quality and segregated education must be guaranteed,” Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for the immediate acceleration of school segregation processes, for this the correct enforcement of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities of the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” Járóka said.
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year’s meeting in Berlin in the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
The fate of the retired Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, discussions on personal issues have been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber and Günther Beckstein will remain in office, questioning how long the pardon will last.
A special party congress will decide on the fate of the tandem, which suffers a disastrous 17 percent vote loss, on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the critics of the pair have made it clear that they do not cling to their chairs with all their strength.
In doing so, they tried to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who, a day after the "bajor tsunami," demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has gained only 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the “single dominant” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives continue to be highly counted in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of reorganization within the party, Vice President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is a potential successor to Huber, will also be part of a narrow scout team that will start sweeping talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Elections about a possible government coalition in Munich.
It is a strange joke that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo as an opportunity for a coup, is on the list of the Free Electors, and then was ruthlessly beaten by the ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now putting all their energy into trying to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
Stoiber, who has so far woven the threads from the background, will also play an active role in the transition, calling September 28 the bitterest day in the political career of the former provincial head of government and former CSU president.
Huber released a few bile remarks to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel will not be Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is somehow rebuilt.
Merkel, who is hard to disguise her disappointment over the fiasco, said the loss of ground by the CSU would not have a negative impact on the Great Coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, of course: the wounded CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6%.
Lukashenko resistance: 110-0
Not a single member of the opposition was allowed into the Belarusian parliament in the wake of Sunday’s election.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegality of the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 10-million-strong country’s one hundred-ten-strong legislature has been devoid of opposition for more than a decade, the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) before yesterday’s elections had earnest hopes that Lukashenko, who was renewing his presidency in the controversial elections of 2006 for the fourth time, would “allow” the appearance of some opposition representatives in the parliament.
The ODSZ also suspended the boycott that had been considered in advance.
The reason behind the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has taken credit to reduce the ever-increasing price of Russian gas imports and also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz, which has been in possession of gas pipelines through the country, to Russian hands – wanted to improve its relations with the EU due to the high level of unauthorised entry into the EU, where the anti-democratic Belarusian politician.
As a preliminary measure of relief, the OSCE emphasised positive moves rather than shortcomings in its assessment of the election campaign, such as the refusal of a third of opposition candidates to leave.
However, the OSCE swift report on Monday already objected to the campaign - in which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular to the fact that the opposition could not be present when counting the votes.
However, the opposition believes that there is still a visible improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus on paper forms a federal state, has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward, one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich said.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable that this should continue, despite the fact that “the power was terrified of allowing even an opposition member into the weightless parliament.”
The opposition is not planning any protest actions in view of the results, but is trying to convey its message to the electorate about the need for economic reforms.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting barriers to distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main achievement, is not even the most officially supported retirement population.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness and the increasing trade deficit, it is a matter of time for the social security to break down, which evokes the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, the head of the Community of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that “people do not believe in words, but in deeds,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
Uniquely in the history of the Chigi Palace, rotary doors have been installed for the entry and exit of workers.
From today onwards, this new measure will come into effect against skilled people, to filter out those who block you and then go out for a coffee during working hours.
Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office, presented the anti-laziness novelty today.
"The rotary gates," Brunetta said, "are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services."
A new, more responsible and transparent time is coming.
That is the real reform,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the installation of rotary gates is also symbolically important.”
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over during working hours, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta says, “A good cappuccino at seven o’clock in the morning can work wonders.”
The College of Public Administration in Rome
At the meeting, the Minister said: “In three months, the absences of public sector workers due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means 60,000 more people going to work in a year.”
He added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
"Which wage dynamics, according to the minister, in the last eight to ten years have been twice as high as that of the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered to join a petition supported by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest the provisions of the Brunetta Decree.
“While the Minister of Public Administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of absences due to the disease, the number of ‘fatigue lazy people’ is constantly growing,” the consumer association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative workers from all over Italy have gathered to declare war on the unlawful requirements of the decree."
The Regional Administrative Court is challenged, inter alia, by the abolition of supplementary sickness allowance for illness attributable to service reasons, by the extension of the period of residence of workers on sick leave at home, which is the period during which the visitor may appear, and by several other aspects of the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important
In Italy, 2,500 accidents at work occur every day, of which 3 result in death and 27 result in permanent disability.
According to the Occupational Accident Insurance, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, and that accounts for almost twice as many casualties as manslaughter.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organising the Day of Victims of Workers’ Accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, in every county in Italy, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass media to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of prevention in workplace accidents,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, president of the National Association of Workplace Accident Disabilities.
The head of state sincerely commended “the association’s persistent commitment to prevention at work, the protection of the interests of workers in accidents, the assistance to the families of the victims and the sensitization of the public”.
“There is natural and honest indignation about tragedies of this kind, which, by their size, attract media and public attention, but in reality we are faced with dramatic, repeated events every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: “We are undoubtedly struggling with a shortage of resources and funding for education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within schools aimed at direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to allow attention to diminish the social importance of the issue, and to have more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
President of the House of Commons Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed the "grave social significance of fatal accidents at work, which weighs on all consciences, and requires institutions to put an end to them as soon as possible."
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still astonishingly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this downward trend coupled with decreasing attention, because it’s when attention fades that the biggest tragedies happen.”
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more stringent supervision and controls are needed, Mercandelli stressed, and a stronger intervention in the field of workforce training, starting from school education.”
"There is a need for further efforts to inform and responsive the public," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that poses a problem at a social level."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the compensation protection net for victims of accidents at work" and "the aid trend towards which the system has drifted in recent years".
“The goal is therefore to restore the safety provided by insurance to the workers, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the action of the legislators, which are arbitrary in some cases, and which distribute in others.”
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
Permanent hearing loss can be caused by listening to portable players, such as MP3s, for longer periods of time and at high volumes.
In a report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), referred to the opinion published today.
"The report shows that 5-10% of people who listen to their portable music player for more than one hour a day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss," the report said.
“It’s worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones on a massive and frequent basis are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” Kuneva said.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk, and we need to respond to it urgently," he said.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information widely.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can operate efficiently and keep pace with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise pollution caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to explore possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," said the committee member.
While the current European safety standard sets the maximum sound level for portable music players at 100 dB, there is a growing concern about hearing loss caused by the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that users of portable players who listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week are exposed to noise levels above the current maximum level for workplace noise.
If you listen to music in similar conditions for a long time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10 percent of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a commission responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today in March and results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the Committee on the Future of the Cathedral of Rome, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the spas of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will work on the Rome guidelines.
Following the closing remarks in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Local Government Committee, so that the strategic plan for the capital can be submitted in June, as officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“This is a completely independent committee, in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented,” stresses Alemanno, “and it is up to him to develop proposals for Rome’s development vision on which political decision-makers, including the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of interest in terms of powers, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, when it has completed its work, the committee will be disbanded because it has a fixed term of office.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the Cathedral Capital of Rome, the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work redundant, claiming that the opinion it has produced is not binding, Mr Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard proves to be appropriate, as in France for the Attali Commission, which I am sure for Rome, the contribution it will make will play an important role.
The power of politics is often scattered in dealing with day-to-day affairs and in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, are looking further and planning for the longer term, and are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome would like to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless 'head of water', because it is completely free and will not cost any euro to the citizens of Rome, but serves as a thought-provoking tool and aims to attract the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to make the leap of quality it so much needs, thinking about its future in a unified spirit.”
With regard to the future, which the mayor of Rome stresses, "it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but will look much further", we see in it not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also "the role that it can and must play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, self-proclaimed American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to destroy the American economy with his decisions and maintain close ties (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam.
As election time approaches, attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
Obama presumptuously believes he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far had only two governors and five senators who are black.”
These attacks are, in fact, meaningless; they are, of course, racist in nature, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether he will be a good president.
In this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
In the interior of the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in an editorial: “We well know who the true American patriot is voting for in the ballot box.”
A side of the American way of thinking appears here, which has been hidden until the last moment.
"Just say what you want, and we'll know where to put it, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush’s term? 89% responded that it was Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and was dumped in the buttocks by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans did not have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak point.
There is a great deal to be done to replace George W.
U.S.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come for cutbacks in the editorial boards. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists about their views on the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, at the moment, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns about credibility had diminished.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the cuts to the newspaperroom, i.e. the editorial offices that make the newspapers.
If we do not want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum, in the sense that the general public understands it, this problem must be solved, the interviewed journalists say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty per cent of journalists and senior executives working in print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65% of journalists hold senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press to see where the Internet is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the “killer” of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has risen to 79 percent.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they voted for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, there is a gap in the American press industry between editorial directors, i.e. directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of executives are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, while at the local level, that figure is only 23 percent.
Some people link this to a secure job.
At the national level, 47% of managers fear they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this is 30%.
In America, the issue of "safe work" at the team level (in the case of our editors, editors) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
In a vast nation like the United States of America, with its 300 million inhabitants, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers, employers tend to offer as much as they want, so it works on a "must or not" basis.
Directors usually get high salaries, and editors can earn up to <0x24>10,000 a month, in addition to paying pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third also, until after a certain period of time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admissions, often get “sick” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT: DANILO COPPOLA RESIDES IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, a real estate professional, who wanted to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the framework of an investigation into the agreement on the exchange of shares between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and changed to a ban on exit from the Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional be allowed to pass from the small rural town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow to influence the company’s affairs and have access to the evidence brought against it.
The Elite in Danger
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago, when the House of Representatives did not vote for the <0x24>700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested, and still are, in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has resulted in a break within the Republican Party that shows an increasing division between the traditional, restrained Eastern coastal attitude in support of federal institutions and business circles and the ever-increasing new anti-Washington and anti-financial world stance in the central and southern states.
This line was critically expressed in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
The above event, however, is only one of the major changes that the ongoing economic rearrangement foreshadows or allows us to see, not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have been latent for a long time and that are consolidating in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualization, the re-establishment of a double category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects those banking and financial institutions which, while having close links with the rest of the world, are primarily and on a fairly wide scale attracting people and families living in a single country, a single state.
This, on the other hand, presents a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
Thus, the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of bounds: the European Union, which is unable to define a unified political line between different interests and different national strategies, is a fine example of this.
So everyone expects intervention, a rescue package, a revival and new rules from the individual national governments, but most importantly, the opening of funds: because in a difficult situation, only the individual states have economic resources, financial resources that can make things right.
They also have the means and the authority to use them: they have two invaluable resources in certain circumstances that no other market or international organisation will ever possess to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation-statehood is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times has given increasing importance to a factor closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were entering the abstract world of the grid, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, and that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not so abstract as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one half of the planet to the other, yet they are wholly related to a limited place, an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more cards than someone who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
This brings me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
He who says territory, state, government, must also say: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two intertwined phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can handle events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, who have proven to be completely incompetent and have shown that much of the obscurity lies ahead.
The two together are of even deeper significance and, in a sense, more disturbing: a feeling of loss of trust, impatience, inadequacy and segregation that affects the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite, which has hitherto peaked, is over. It has expired before they have embraced their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the complex sense of the word. With this, the social elite is increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, fuels a diverse but strong movement of delegitimation against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in the unexpected "revolts" of voters, or in recent sudden changes in the anti-Italian mood. For example, the rise to power of conservatives in Congress in Austria and Bavaria, the unity of Labour in Britain.
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and even its renowned intellectuals, together with its habits, press and intellectuals, understands less and less and less what has been happening in the deeper strata of Western society for some time.
Despite all this, it would be an exaggeration to speak of “the imminent revolt of the masses.”
But walking with your eyes open isn't bad at all.
We can walk on the wall with super strong glue
Use a super-strong glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
With a piece of glue measuring only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal STUDY-Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of special, so-called carbon nanotube materials that already exist.
“The principle of the adhesive has to be conceived as a pipe system similar to a packet of spaghetti,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the gecko’s microscopic folded foot, which gives the animal perfect grip.
Tests on materials such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles, while at the same time “easily detaching from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a less impressive use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can also find other applications in the field of space exploration.
The superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a hair-like adhesive made of microfiber that goes through self-cleaning as it moves on the surface, providing perfect grip at all times.
Medications? Fruit juice is forbidden!
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin, thirsty drinks, especially popular in summer, when taken together with certain life-saving medicines, alter the way they are absorbed, increasing or reducing their effect, depending on the case. This can also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, said at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, preventing their beneficial effects and putting them at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already on the accused’s bench when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety drugs, heart rhythm regulators and nerve medications to levels that could be considered toxic.
RISKY MEDICINES - Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official journal and warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with such co-consumption seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to researchers, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, Professor of Pharmacy at the University of Milan, points out: “Discoveries of this kind are usually immediately communicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, make sure that the information in the leaflets of a particular drug is changed.
That’s why you should always read the instructions for the medicine you are going to take, and if something is not understandable, don’t let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly,” said a specialist at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the territorial relationship between commercial models and economic activity.
Krugman, a 55-year-old Neo-Keynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s strongest critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has provoked a lot of controversy; it has been repeatedly thrown into the eye of the economist, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and a little shocked, at how quickly public interest overcame the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "crunchy value economist," but at the same time he "spreads criticisms of the Bush administration's excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive manner."
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a personal productivity-enhancing, open-code application package that targets an ever-wider range of users, from home to office, from freelancers to administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work managed by SUN Microsystem and carried out by volunteer developers, the new Open Office brings more innovations to the public: besides a welcome screen and a redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it also offers more essential innovations, such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ISO-compliant ODF (Open Document 1.2) format.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so that Open Office can open Microsoft documents with new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Another feature that is interesting is the specific feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending a file by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module, keeping the page-correct layout.
On the same interface, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editing elements.
In-app sharing has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports shared workbooks, but prevents each other from overwriting their work. Each co-worker’s post is marked with a different color, which helps to make it easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice’s features available on the cloud, so the final version will probably be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been added to the mirror since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the package is also available for Linux.
On request, we can collect the installation CD either at home or at work.
Free is probably the biggest attraction for the home application, but the Open Office suite is now trying to get into the business sector as well, as you can count on a number of government and school projects.
There is no shortage of education, consulting and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business horizons.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-corresponding text editor; Calc, Excel-replaced spreadsheet; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to Access database manager; and finally Draw, the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but if you take into account the fact that we are already at 3,600,000 with the release of the new version, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl’s results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
In the last stage of the Tour de France, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed for the Gerolsteiner team and won the bronze medal as well as the best mountaineer jersey, once again produced a positive sample.
The news was published on the website of Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer after Italian Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepol, and German Gerolsteiner driver Stefan Schumacher, who had a positive result in the Cera test for the third generation of the EPO.
Kohl’s blood samples, similar to the tests carried out in recent weeks, were tested in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control tests confirm a positive Cera result, the Austrian loses his third place and is banned from racing for two years.
The news of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported to the Associated Press that he had signalled a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian won the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, as well as the best mountaineering polka dot jersey.
Immigrants: Is NEW YORK TIMES READING THE QUESTION, IS ITALIAN RACE?
Italy has only recently been transformed from an immigrant country into a favorite destination for reluctantly admitted immigrants.
This is a question raised by the New York Times, based on the case of the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits, and devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case well describes what the New York Times calls the "northern paradox": in the northern regions, "the strongest integration and the highest employment" but "anti-immigrantism and support for the Northern League" are also the strongest in the country.
In support of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Actually.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the barriers to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have also been discussed as an example of the mood shift in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed this tendency: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students suffer from expensive rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Union of Tenants, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such an astonishing scale that, due to the high total cost to families, it is blocking a wide range of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Study Office. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general upward trend has also begun against local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rental limit, linked subleases.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices through a review of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in the Brianza area, the price of a single room is 450 euros; the price ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros for double rooms and 370-500 euros for single rooms.
In Rome, areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) charge about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 for a single bed and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450 for a double bed.
Slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) prices around other universities (Ostienne and Cinecittà).
In suburban districts, you can save some: a bed costs 300 euros and a single room costs 450 euros in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, a bed is charged 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price range is the highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, one bed is 250/350 euros, and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are more important within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often seek accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinemas in the cities has passed
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
The pictures, taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore, impressively illustrate what is happening in Italy’s big cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and the subsequent decay of single-room cinemas in the city centers - is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time carries all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When historic and memorable places disappear, "it's like having a friend go away, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which twenty years ago won an Oscar, as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival, probably lost to Tornatore.
The largest association of operators, Anec, has reported that 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in major cities: 10 cinemas in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna leads among the most affected regions, losing 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the proliferation of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance is no better evidence than the fact that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and by the same number in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec president Paolo Protti. "Okay, we are building new facilities, but the survival of those that already exist should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all those who go there are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfunded funds intended to support operators: the State’s overdue debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is disgraceful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government is not complying with the legislation in force.
It would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to maintain the market.”
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city to decide, in its concern about closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost the single-room cinemas in the outer and downtown areas.
The provisions would include tax advantages for operators and benefits for the public in terms of accessibility: spectators can enter restricted zones and park at a reduced rate in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna, even by introducing other measures.
But it’s also certain that traditional cinemas need to improve sound and image quality to be able to fight multiplexes, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and adolescence, gave me the spark that made me finally make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go on the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale to avoid seeing the blackened posters of the dust, I turn my head. I have had so many experiences here."
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, Gioia Tauro's mayor arrested
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions.”
Judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria have made serious accusations against Gioia Tauro, Mayor and Deputy Mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, as well as Rosarno Mayor Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal network.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his nephew, a lawyer of the same name, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like crime network, were also handcuffed and charged with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in damages.
"Disregard of all legal and moral rules, even of good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay counseling fees to lawyer Piromalli.
"Then the clan would have officially had access to the town hall, which would have given additional opportunity to control and manage the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the region of Calabria, does not hide that there is “many collusion between the local institutions and the organized underworld” in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean."
The arrests this morning are a sequel to the events of July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even then due to alleged interconnections between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor who reigned in the dissolution, took the lead of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He shouted a scandal when the County House ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
The then deputy interior minister Marco Minnini has been tried and accused of planning everything for political reasons, but the court said in a warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had ventured to demand a change to the A3 project.
The interception ordered against Dal Torrione reveals, state prosecutors write, that "he was willing to comply with the demands of an extensive entrepreneur representing a group known to be close to the Piromalli family, and to subordinate the local government's decisions to the interest of the clan."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70% of the planet’s surface and is only now being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron are now trying to put their hands on.
For hundreds of years, they've been looking for ways to get energy from the motions of the sea, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of exploiting offshore energy was put aside, but today the demands of environmental protection and the re-elevation of oil prices are giving the industry a new impetus.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by installations that use sea waves.
That’s twice as much as is currently being produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
Giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to offshore energy and in 2005 signed an agreement to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies are opting for offshore energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy so far.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is considering working with us," a spokesman for an associated oil giant, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit issued by the US Energy Commission to launch a project in Alaska to exploit offshore energy.
This is of no small importance, especially considering that the US is currently extracting oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are also on the path of offshore energy. The amounts invested so far, as far as the details are concerned, show a growing interest.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, this is still a rudimentary technology, just because the energy from the sea does not dispel the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing installations, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not pose a major problem for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a larger scale, however, it is necessary to have installations with a greater environmental impact.
There are several options: for example, Ocean Power uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves that move the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity flows through cables under the sea to land.
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are only awaiting federal permits. Some of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines located in the East River Strait in New York.
During a tide, the movement of water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits to use the energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through tides.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent <0x24>7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the tides, an amount expected to rise to <0x24>35 million in 2009.
