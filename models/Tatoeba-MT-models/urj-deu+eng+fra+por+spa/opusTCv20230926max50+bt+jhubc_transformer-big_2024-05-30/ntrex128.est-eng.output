Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they may look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are shocked by the recommendation to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The topic has come from the plan to change the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political tendencies in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member of the National Assembly said his group members were concerned because it rhymes with “Twp and Pwp.”
For the sake of clarity to readers outside of Wales: the Welsh word daft means poop and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid said the group as a whole was “not happy” and suggested other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was “receptive” to the name change, but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to the word “Muppet”.
For the sake of clarity, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are called will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposed names, which broadly supports the idea of renamed the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term "Members of the Welsh Parliament, or WMP", but the public pollers were most in favour of the "MWP".
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law on the amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the deprivation of rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves in the debate on the legislation.
Macedonians hold referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum will be held with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour’s name represents a claim to this territory and has repeatedly objected to its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that a name change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as Harlem churches struggle
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there used to be a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them.”
He said the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
“People are communicating differently nowadays,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood where people are staying every day.”
However, as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that “sooner or later they will be back in the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who do not reach out to the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who are therefore accelerating the arrival of the day when all these churches will close their doors, as it is unlikely that the majority of the people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black church, which had worshipped nearby, took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to restore the building, they adopted a bell toy.
Father Johnson's son and heiress of St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July, however, gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this is the world’s first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago continued to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by the secular leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
In July, the presidency of the Church, the presidency of the parish, which consists of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese that the diocese was “trying to pass on expenses”, even though the presidency was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the diocese's actions.
Thirteen-year-old boy in California injured by shark after lobster
Authorities say the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was scuba diving in California for lobster on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then swam in with others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy expressed his enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but “then he realized that the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire clavicle was torn bare," Hammel described the sight he saw when he got to the boy.
“I called out to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of shark attacked is still unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, from Casablad to Swami, for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty aisles with expert advisors.
As part of a significant penetration of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion beauty market, which is on the rise as sales of fashion and home goods continue to decline, broader lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country and will be introduced to other stores next year if successful.
The reason for the investment in beauty products is that supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its makeup line Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are demanding more and more.
Fragrance Shop is also testing exclusive sales licenses at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets are becoming more and more like supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight low-cost chains like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos's outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitat's outlets since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s earlier attempt to upgrade its beauty and therapeutic departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a quarrel about how to share the proceeds from the sale of supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281 sons to Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trade chain.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skincare products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Business Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products’ aisles to improve the surrounding environment for customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need. However, the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trade, which can change the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left "angry" when television host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the home goods and clothing brand Truly.
The pair’s business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV host of "This Morning" announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Deni star Peter Jones infuriated by stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “furious” when a television star girl admitted at a tense meeting held Tuesday at the man’s business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean she doesn’t have enough time to devote herself to the homewear and clothing brand Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s primary preference.
It was supposed to secure his distant future, so she thought she would be doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to launching the product line.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that leaving the head of the TV show “This Morning,” one of the UK’s most paid celebrities, could cost the company millions, as products ranging from sofa pillows and candles to clothes and homewear have invested a hefty amount of money.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-created Truly with Capp in 2016. Jones, 52, joined the brand as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones’ close sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
Difficult conversation, “after what we fell in love”
Trump joked about criticism in the news for commenting on what some consider “unworthy of the president” and being overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mocking “news anchor voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, Kim was interested in a second meeting.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been halted.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
He added that the United States will continue to impose pressure on the country.
The perspective of Trump’s stimulus speech was much more vivid.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“North Korea was at war.
Millions of people would have died.
Everything is fine between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: missile tests have been completed, the release of hostages has been helped, and the repatriation of remains of American servants has been arranged.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside waiting to get to this full-fledged stadium, it’s better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Indonesia Island Killing Hundreds of People
When dealing with the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok's population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so the situation is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with the force of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren in the Palu probably increased the number of deaths.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is quite challenging even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics there even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which has stopped to treat the victims of the Lombok earthquake, is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made the repair of the cracked infrastructure in Indonesia a central part of his election campaign, and he has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Mr. Joko is threatened by budget deficits, as next year there will be new elections.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from dissidents in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to an older form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of a game at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team led 1:0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of the distant pole.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get in the position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are passing the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I did one touch, and I hit him without much thought.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1–0 thanks to a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the Blues striker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning around in the midfield and rushing into Liverpool's side.
Kovacic gave a quick pass in the middle.
Then he created a beautiful aerial bait, leading Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard crossed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot against Liverpool player Alisson Becker in the farthest post.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague game on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed due to a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With over 380,000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation began this morning after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stabbing wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling to contact people in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose onboard cameras may have recorded something, to contact us, as they may have information vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, her alleged friends came to the scene, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police said they would notify the woman's immediate relatives at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear of the incident.
The residents were told that it could take hours for them to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, “It’s awful.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in the closed area, and a third one was right next to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event is asked to send a direct message to the account <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the keyword September 30 Log 247.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the last monument to the cause of the “rewriting of history” quarrel
Its elimination would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style by the man’s inhuman devout followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was impossible for the monument in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace to remain intact.
Cromwell did not loote the pictures in the English Civil War himself, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas, the ancestor of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant presentation of Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historical description of a person whom many people think should still be honored."
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people at the end of the 19th rather than today regarded Cromwell as the guardian of the House of Commons from outside pressure, and in this case, of course, from royalty.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical controversy.
What is certain is that the quarrel of the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Chinese farmer killed by killer pig
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwest China was attacked by a pig who killed a man.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead and covered in blood with an injured artery near the pork market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China's Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate pigs in his farm.
He had reportedly come with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the pig's feather was open.
He said the piglet was a big stallion with a bloody mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 249.47 kilogramme stallion had, according to the report, knocked the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were completely bloody and crushed,” Wu, the cousin of the victim, reported in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the man’s death.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms nailed a Welsh farmer’s tractor until a man’s wife scared the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs usually don’t attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could get sick in the head.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious marathons whose purpose is not to hurt.
You just have to respect them,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa winds bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken by moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding storms to northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a category one hurricane with winds blowing 136.78 kilometers per hour, lying 619.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is headed north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in a tropical storm, it begins to divert deep tropical moisture towards the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
Thereafter, the approaching low-pressure responsive tropical humidity in the south-west of the country will produce extensive heavy rainstorms in the coming days.
At times, rain falling between 2.54 and 10.16 centimetres causes dangerous sudden floods, flooding and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation to increase from five to about seven-and-a-half centimeters per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to precipitate between 5.08 and 10.16 centimeters in certain areas of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
You should definitely not walk in the desert if there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into rapid-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by thunderstorms and volatile dust.
The approaching low-pressure climate is accompanied by severe rainfall in the coastal areas of southern California.
A total of more than 1.27 centimeters of precipitation is possible and may cause smaller floodwaters and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday evening and early on Monday morning, with storms becoming widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains reach the Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. is forecasting major temperature fluctuations due to cooling of the Arctic, while the temperatures in tropical areas will remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is a great example of significant temperature differences in the central US.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), range from almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to gather itself again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to start warm October with temperatures ranging widely around 80 degrees Celsius, from the southern plains to the northeastern part of the country.
New York City expects 26.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the likelihood of high average temperatures in the eastern US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people watched the gripping confessions of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and wife Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts to reflect Friday’s last-minute turnarounds: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk and tried to rip her clothes off at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to the Nielsen report, the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the number of people who watch the transfers in the authorities.
By comparison, it’s about the same size of the audience as it is at the football finals or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel’s opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the Moderate Republican Bureau made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man on Friday morning after he was subjected to protesters’ blasphemy, trying to take the elevator to the Legal Affairs Committee session.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down when he was accused and it was broadcast directly on CNN.
"I'm standing right here, in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that before the lift closed, he had more to say at the sitting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live several hours later, when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that next week the FBI will investigate allegations against the candidate, which have been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with a friend of the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake ruling had an effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without the investigation's confirmation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview given to the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who criticized his plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and of damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper that featured Theresa May on the cover with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pushed his attack on May’s so-called Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other is “completely brainless.”
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in jail on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had Simpson’s DNA found on them, CBS-owned WAFB television reported.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said the man's bail was set at <0x24>350,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge Coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head in the neck area.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Operations Team, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police and people living in the area for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the region’s law enforcement authorities for “putting diligence and justice on their feet.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
His last season average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team had been “shouldered” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“It’s something you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater resumed its operations, which resulted in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash eruptions within 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of thunders and tremors.
Images shared on social media depict the ash-covered car’s windshield in different parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists clash with police before independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the riot police. Thousands joined opposition protesters to celebrate the Catalan opposition vote on the withdrawal.
A group of disguised separatist fighters, held back by the riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder coating, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The robbery also occurred later, when the police had to use sticks to control the fights.
Singing for several hours “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness,” the supporters of independence clashed with national unity protesters who shouted “Long live Spain!”.
According to local media, 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the demonstration received medical care.
Tensions remain high in the independence-promoting region a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but was still celebrated by the Catalan secessionists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted in favour of independence, although voter turnout was low because those who opposed the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block the vote in front of polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence advocates had stayed in front of polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
The protests took place, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a secessionist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as independent.
“Last year was one of the best moments of our lives.
“I saw my parents crying joyfully about the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan parties that support independence have had a hard time maintaining the stigma this year, as a number of prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their role in the holding of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a demonstration in support of the police on her mobile phone, said the quarrel was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the pressure from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested for Car Crashing House
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into the house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 p.m. British time on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
At some point, a bow arrow could also be fired at the car.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won
Livingston promoted the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games in which he was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will not win the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, who are down by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his invincible attack to seven games, while coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Stupid Visitors
Holt's team should have led long before the goal was scored, as their straightforward playing style caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts stopped in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to catch Craig Halkett's headshot across the gate.
The hosts quietly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to the quests in certain places.
And that's also how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers gave up the free shot, and Livingston had a chance to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers were mostly in possession of the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defeated Scott Pittman and Lithgow shone brightly in another team effort by Livingston.
The punches continued to reach Livingston's penalty area and were consistently kicked out of it. Two punches were also dismissed, one for attempting to replace Halkett's Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great at surpassing expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their playing style and players have barely changed since returning to top level, but Holt must be honoured for how he has toughened up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, arranging a perfectly organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the hind legs throughout the game.
The Rangers were scarcely inspired.
Despite their intermediate good standing under Gerrard's leadership, this was not enough according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be inadequate: they only made it home once, which could serve as an alarm bell for the Rangers in the center of the table.
Erdogan's Controversial Reception in Cologne
There were both smiles and worries in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police referred to security, forbidding a crowd of 25,000 to assemble in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up near it to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, most of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise him as self-governing.
Road accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist crashed into a car in London.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street intersection in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance doctors arrived to provide help, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about two kilometers from Saturday's crash site, where a driver who hit the cyclist escaped from the scene.
The London police said the authorities were working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
Traffic is closed at the scene and buses are redirected, drivers of motor vehicles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Officers Injured in Riots
The prison service said six prison officers were injured in the riots in a highly secure men's prison.
Unrest broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30am British summer time on Sunday and has not yet ended.
To deal with the unrest in one wing, involving eight prisoners, expert riot police officers have been involved.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison workers have been called to resolve an ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
However, in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to calm serious unrest, during which prison officials were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (hurricane could benefit drought regions)
Tropical low-pressure conditions don’t hit Arizona often, but it’s likely to happen early next week, when the calming hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert of the United States, bringing with it the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already arranged sudden flood monitoring on Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area already on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure level within a 321,86 kilometre radius of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane passing 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of rainfall, which can reach up to 15.24 centimeters in the confined areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other desert areas of the U.S. edeas, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Neck, precipitation is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching up to 10.16 centimeters in confined areas.
In areas that tolerate sudden floods, Rosa’s rainfall can be a blessing, as the area suffers from drought.
While floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial as droughts prevail in Southwest America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or the second largest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with the highest winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour north.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore subsides slightly.
Thus, Rosa is expected to reach the Mexican mainland with the intensity of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, we can expect rains ranging from 7.62 to 15.24 centimeters in total, sometimes reaching 25.4 centimeters," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico in a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure that moves across Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main threat that follows Rosa or her aftermath is very strong rainstorms in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests Related to Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with puncture wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British Summer Time.
The victim was hospitalized in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old, and 20-year-old man was arrested last night in Avon and Somerset in the Radstock area, police said.
Officials ask to contact anyone who may have cell phone records from the case.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered” under the hatred and viciousness of the Democratic Party
“Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the relentless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an encouraging speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered” during the Democratic Party’s appointment process, “under witchcraft and hatred.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, fiercely and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day."
The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the most esteemed law-abiding men of our time, with an impeccable background in public service," he told a supportive crowd in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while also discussing the importance of the Republic's turnout in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and prevent.”
The first major referendum on Kavanaugh’s candidacy on the floor of the Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, Republican party leaders’ senior vice president told CNN.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia Killed Thousands, Number of Dead
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away after the tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when six-metre-long waves hit the beach, killing a bunch of people and destroying everything that was left on the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing what they were doing on the beach rather than running away immediately, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, sweeping everything from the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centers.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Authority showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The coastal towns continued on Saturday.
The area of 2.4 million people was affected by earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday after a severe earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city along the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater in a coastal area 300 km north of Palu called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake center.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers are headed to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy that could get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on the top floor of a building warning panicked people on the street below of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying homes and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the correctness of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage, which impeded communications in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft providing assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuators are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The airport was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
That's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Phu Quoc, where they are shaded by the tents erected in their office yard, they saw devastating sights along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Although the relief forces started to mitigate the disaster vigorously, some complained that highly experienced employees of foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and reinforcements can only be sent from abroad if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This continues to be a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start accepting international aid, but such a status has not yet been declared.”
When the second night arrived in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing were still filled with hope that their loved ones would be those wonderful events that ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the debris next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national sliding paratroopers team, trained two missing sliding paratroopers for Asian games that took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest who are trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior slipper, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the community of sliding paratroopers, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Ask competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird in place of two blue bird.
"I think that means the messages didn't get through," he said.
Thieves claimed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 while filling an ATM at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 from a Newport on the Levees ATM employee, a Newport Police Department press release said.
The driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and prepared to bring more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When he acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to a press release, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about thieves is requested to contact the Newport Police Department by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will be renamed Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, the man wrote, “The former Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change takes place before her performance on Saturday Night Live, where she expects to release her new album, Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her concert "in emotion," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the man's present name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means 'you,'" West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, they’re us.
I changed my name to Kanye, which means “this one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West isn’t the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is mostly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Previously working with West, JAY-Z has also used his name with and without a dash, in uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use an army against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to contain the Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were on their heels across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double AI funding.
"As China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount allocated to research in this field," said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and AI practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, last year, China announced its plan to be a player in the AI renewal by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are working on the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
The double funding would double the likelihood of the next major AI achievement being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won America's best Othello player. Later, he was on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
"U.S. scientists must work hard to get government funding," Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the intellectuals, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. support AI efforts.
“I think people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academia, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a united artificial intelligence center to engage partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the creation of an AI-elected committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it began funding the <0x24>2 million initiative AI Next.
But the National Science Fund is currently funding more than <0x24>100 million a year for research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been changed.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the new name for Macedonia in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the name would damage the national identity of the Macedonian Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to participate in the referendum, and the campaign of disregard has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure its accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required for a name change.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave Strumica their vote on 30 September 2018 in a Macedonian referendum to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising chairs in front of the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the doors of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can appeal to others, such as China and Russia, and benefit from European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that a large majority is in favour of changing the name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the “yes” would be “the confirmation of our future.”
The results of a poll released by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies on Monday revealed that 30 to 43 percent of voters are planning to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government’s Western policy since it took over the leadership in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton’s defense for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton defense, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like he scored a goal in his 65th minute of play ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the border of the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by hitting the right side of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he was going to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that point.”
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before driving Sterling further.
The Sky Blues pushed the ball into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League with Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies
When the Nationals were out of the finals, there was little reason to start again.
Fighting Scherzer hopes to knock down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers in a single game at the NL West, still has a chance to make it to the final.
The Rockies secured at least a joker spot with 5–2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure their first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and the other team is probably at a higher level than any other game that I can expect this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have not yet named a Sunday opening player, but they are allegedly inclined towards Scherzer's dish in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, did a warm-up session on Thursday and feed on Sunday as usual.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18-7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks is 300, and the favorable chances of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump to Speak in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republic's turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It’s a big event that I’m not running for, but I’m actually running for, and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible group of extremist democrats. You see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power by any means. You can see their vicious and filthy game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride over for power and control, all they want is power and control, and we don't give them that."
The Democrats are on a mission to “resist and prevent”.
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "hateful, evil, vile, and liar."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Legal Committee, who was shouting out loud in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a political party.
It is intolerable to those who express their opinions.
When my local momentum party activists voted to condemn me, it was not very surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour MEPs to be told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she stood strongly for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the judges criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement, “We want meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight years as a local Labour Member of Parliament with Friday evening assembly meetings is exactly that.
As of today, this is unfortunately no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be “kinder and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten, if it was ever ever remembered.
It is becoming more and more evident that different points of view are not acceptable to the Labour Party, and for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the party’s management.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and the co-worker, with whom I thought I would share similar political views in the past, now expected me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether it was on national security issues or on the EU single market.
Every time I publicly stand up anywhere, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by a condemnation on social media, encouraging my dismissal, disregarding party politics and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those co-workers who face sexist or racist abuse on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views of this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a big community, and with every “distrust” initiative or change of electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “then everything would be fine.”
But that’s not what I came to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had literally left my large school classroom on the brink of collapse, I have been trying to speak for better public services for those who need it most, both as a local council member and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East has become confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not intended for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of revocation or political consideration will stop me from working for what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the final result somewhat, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun Tennt’s first league game.
They are now the only undefeated team in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was a high level of team defense and better risk-taking that led to the home team winning, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “I respect Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over by the Warriors, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot failed the test.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty strike shortly before the end of the half, reaching a single event at the end of the half in 17–5 in favour of Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was taken over by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Thereafter, a long delay occurred due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man on the stretcher was removed. As the game continued, Ayr increased the lead further thanks to an experiment by Stafford McDowall, broadcast by Climo.
Ayr's chief executive Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, but again paid for Melrose player Bruce Colvine's failed transmission attempt after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing on the home field regained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind the advancing Ayrides.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the box and sent the side guard Gregor Henry off on the home field team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to step into the field of hosting services, after it was discovered that the man was appointed as the director of a renowned restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC television series he writes and plays with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and it seems that Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “blossoming restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia without sea borders hopes the court will open the way for them again to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags flying over the office buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are lined with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
Restoring it is our responsibility.”
Completely sea-free Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive. The same vivid desire is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country is naturally looking forward to a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians from all over the country are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile, after decades of intermittent discussions, is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it will change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no power to give up Chile's territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice will be delivered only six months after the final statements have been heard indicates that this was not a “complicated case,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities," Zárate said.
Morales's militant eloquence has lost all the benevolence of the remaining Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily swift.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most famous presidents, uses the maritime issue to express political resentment.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not release nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by rival leaders during the summit in Singapore.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
According to Ri, these are air castles, believing that the U.S. continued restrictions and refusal to declare war with Korea will lead North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is seriously planning to abandon the arms that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows bring the viewer a series of massive headgears brought to shoppers in their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of odd, huge headgears to the stage during their 2019 summer season that dazzled Paris Fashion Week.
The tall and impractical hats are in fashion this summer on Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to fashion openings.
Valentino’s top piece was an oversupplied beige hat that covered the heads of the models and was decorated with a wide border reminiscent of feathers.
Other extra-large garments included watermelons adorned with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it exactly at the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had stitched mouths, so they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashioned.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with an air pipe and glasses, while the other part resembled a melted ice cream.
And if you continue with your giant fashion moves, you'll be lucky.
Fashion gurus predict that super-large hats can reach the shopping streets near you.
The super-large hats are coming right at the heels of La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that has been seen in the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat that was put on social media, sent another big piece of art to the fashion windows – a beach bag made of straw, almost as big as the bikini model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffia scarves and white leather straps was the top piece of the 2019 summer collection by Jacques La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has exerted so much influence, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the Academic Excellence Rankings and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, with over 30,000 pupils all over Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession, and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that is able to design and implement a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it will come to their minds.
If you talk to him in his native language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s latest exam results, we can see that at the front of the tables there are languages with the highest exam pass rates among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received a grade of A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, which are now among the subject choices, are included in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find jobs, 17% of respondents reported lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more hopeful job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice you make, learning a second language will give you a real advantage in the future, as language skills will be lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens immediately gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. The only language with a two-digit percentage of speakers was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
Different languages are taught in every school in Scotland.
A number of schools prefer to focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the option of choosing between several languages, which are taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It can no longer be denied that in a globalised business environment, languages are crucial for the future of a country, and therefore must be reflected in education.
It is modern languages that should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Avid fans will no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in the pre-season opening game on Sunday.
However, the number of games has yet to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48," Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play the countless minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-season schedule for the Lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up," he said.
Trump's West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his campaign event series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first campaign event out of five planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote stands until Trump elects who to appoint to the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, he is trying to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. East Coast time.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign event can be watched online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which became tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, the Senate approval vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of the campaign event series is to help revitalize Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump’s campaign manager said the goal of the five events next week was to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to the president's agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible into a fast-paced campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters who didn't want to mention his name.
“Tonight’s campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
On Saturday, it is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who leads the rankings according to polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has a nerve to compete, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the games on Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging turning point pendulum is a completely fictitious concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the turning point is now?
"They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think I can consider this a small turning point," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe has the advantage, that is clear, because it is led by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don’t have enough wind in their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been striking in both tee and grin and is setting an example.
These cries of victory from the throat became louder and louder with each lap, shading the decisive put, which would have led to a fourth match draw after he and Thomas were down.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar shout, showing the man's belief that the Americans weren't out of the race yet.
“You just have to get more focused and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
The strange but beloved couple in Europe is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, also avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine Friday mornings.
This game and the way their energy flows to and from the noisy crowds reinforces the belief that the players that compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, are not the most famous players to confirm a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, talk about the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine digged the Spaniard and the Swede into such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to get you out of the hole.
Four-balls and doubles are extremely fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice given to each other, the lack of advice, and how five can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken the lead with a strong lead for the last day, but this session of the Quartet showed that the US team has a nerve to fight, which some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup in 10-6 on the last day
Europe is ahead of the Ryder Cup on its final day, taking the lead of 10-6 against the United States after Saturday’s four-ball and doubles.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories in front of struggling Tiger Woods to raise their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who contributed to the preservation of the Cup lost at Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in doubles by winning two games, but they were unable to make up for the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 solo games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, after a fun weekend called Molliwood, they are the second pair to have won four points in their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeauvel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost 19 of his 29 four-balls and doubles, winning seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested out as a four-ball for the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to a doubles game, defeating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world rankings.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Triple-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a solid 2–1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in doubles, after losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has returned from a four-point deficit, going into singles, although as owners, Furyk’s half only needs a tie to keep the cup.
Although being second best for two days, after Sunday’s counterattack, they seem to be failing.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm itself unilaterally due to lack of trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions deepened their mistrust of the United States and that the country does not intend to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that over the past year, North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and pledging not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see any response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security, and under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “phasing-out” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards a "nuclear denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has demanded an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The U.S. calls for ‘first nuclear disarmament’ and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their goal by coercion, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that restrictions are pushing us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions will exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, had been one of the parties to the issue of nuclear weapons, the issue of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year’s one when he told the UN General Assembly that the inevitability of North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was after Trump called Kim “the rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but added that much remains to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s enforcement of restrictions must continue vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased restrictions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met in Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After his July meeting with Pyongyang, he said progress had been made, after which he was condemned by North Korea for “gangster-like demands” in just a few hours.
North Korea pledged to dismantle missiles and nuclear facilities at Moon’s meeting this month if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that by "appropriate measures" he meant the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn How to Get Enough Rest
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight the growing aggressive culture of learning through caffeinated night-to-day learning marathons.
Students who love academia at the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
This course was designed by Harvard Medical School anaesthetist and Brigham and Women's Hospital expert Professor Charles Czeisler, who said it was the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create a course after giving a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told about this only now, in my last year of school?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - it made me nervous," she told the Telegraph.
The course, which entered the curriculum for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said the university decided to take a course of study after finding that students were severely sleep-deprived during their working week.
The one-hour course covers a number of interactional tasks.
In one section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects their athletic performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with reciprocal symbols encourages participants to think about their daily practice.
“We know that this does not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
He said that there is still pride in study marathons at night, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Providing adequate quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps with weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger state, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to contribute to the creation of an inter-university course.
As a next step, he wants all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set alarm clocks for both sleeping and waking, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” caused by electronic displays and LED lighting, as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest result when Dolly Menga's shot, accompanied by Steven Gerrard, led to a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to get its first guest win since February, when they defeated 4-1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard to lose another 18 games as leader, lagging eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' poor readiness never recovered.
The Rangers thus fall in sixth place, while Livingston rises to third place, remaining below Hibernian with only one goal.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, as their assailant Calum Spence needed to be treated for a head wound after he was hit with a likely discarded object.
Gerrard made eight side changes that led to Ayrist and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
At the same time, Holt went on with the same Liv 11 who took a hit on Hearts last week and would have been happy with how his well-trained boys choked their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder didn't take his chance.
The deep free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arc blow to the rear post.
The Rangers gained control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt firmly that he should have been penalized when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbia player's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's headline or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While Liv’s 34th minute kickoff may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who simply carried the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted during the break, switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. This exchange almost paid off when the edge player split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block his seat.
But Livingston continued to lure guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted his leadership at the end of the line, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow struck a large arc from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again applied for a penalty punch when he went down with Jacobs, which Thomson again dissatisfied.
Almanahh: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and counting ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, the Geiger Counter also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Coronado Clocks", starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, you can hear the pounding of atoms separated from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s just popping up!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to 'See' Cheat Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to 'See' Cheat Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cheat cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a common protein for many cancers and are injected back
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to detect fake cells disappeared from ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ the protein that has spread in different HER2 cancers, and then they are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers,” said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which patients are taken immune cells and trained to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with a supportive tribe, wearing a hat on SNL live.
It didn't go very well.
You can watch Saturday Night Live in the studio hear a defamatory whistle choir directed at Kanye West, after his confused speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the inscription Make America Great, he began to protest against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had been so concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the set with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judges Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual assault.
While this episode didn't air, West's noise shots were uploaded to comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West's post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes with his hat.
“They were making fun of me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go there with a hat on.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I’m drowned in the place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I’ll put on my Superman cape because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments triggered the anger of the viewers at least twice and seemed to be embarrassing to the SNL team. According to Variety, one person posted: "The whole studio remained deadly silent."
West had been brought to the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West astonished many with the song "I Love It", which, when performed, looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one brave soul, THANK YOU FOR NOT CALLING THE PEOPLE."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I chose NOT to reward (by buying my music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who, in my opinion, believes and propagates a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now "former Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly-deceased music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder in connection with stab wounding of Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast magistrate on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Celebrity Kit Harington Doesn't Approve Good Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) dismisses the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be harsh.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of the <0x23>MeToo age of the ugly masculinity.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31), a companion in Game of Thrones, admitted that she felt “quite strongly” that the problem needed attention.
"I personally feel quite strongly right now that we have gone wrong with masculinity somewhere," he said.
“What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problem that we now see?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in masculinity, as it shows super-manly characters.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be just like that if they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change it?
“Something has gone wrong for the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that after the series ends, he will never participate in any of the sequences of the Game of Thrones next summer, saying that he is "finished with his battlefields and horses."
Since November, Kit has been involved in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his kidnapping brother.
The actress recently revealed that she considers meeting her wife Rose the best thing about Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the award-winning fantasy series Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen exponentially to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
In some parts of China , HIV was mainly transmitted through blood transfusions .
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s antiquated values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to use universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee GOP senator’s data leaks, saying it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that her employee had posted personal data of three U.S. senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more despicable lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of a Senate panel regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Older websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and issued membership information for an employee under Waters, Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are compromised by these fraudulent and false statements, are not in any way responsible for this leakage of information.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is the result of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has a type of feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not get angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They need to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“It’s important when it comes to truth,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had “warned relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about their fraudulent allegations.”
“We will do everything we can to uncover the perpetrators,” he continued, “and to make them legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's Under-Equipped Spy Parody
It is now a custom to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate in the parody series of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became a sequel to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to make fun of ourselves on the subject of how obviously stupid we are in the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his rubber-eyed face, has been allowed to do things again in his cunning way – and that this wide-ranging comic creation is designed for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it’s a secret agent who, despite his oddly pretentious smoothie glamor, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little bit the character who gave a tone to the Chariots of Fire’s slogan at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the character’s traveler and international mystery Atkinson, once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, who leaves nothing but chaos behind.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he wore medieval armor and the helicopter's impellers pounded on his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to make a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible also confidently present themselves as a comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English’s cunning adventures aren’t as ingenious and focused as Atkinson’s dumb movies Beanina.
Nowadays, there is an ever-current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British secret police officers, thus disappointing the on-site agent—unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political impopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character brilliantly, but there’s not much in the script to work on.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in one of the fancy institutions, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: Here are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency notification and reunited with his former longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgrace of His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls under the hands of a dangerously charismatic tech billionaire, who claims to be able to solve all the British computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: hiding themselves as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly restraining Volta’s luxury yacht on board; and English triggers a real mess as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta’s house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and hasty as it is, the whole thing is attached to the children's TV taste.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And like other Johnny English movies, I caught myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role for Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies a plan where the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has considered a ground-breaking plan that states that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to employees, giving them one additional day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend — but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda, and so the state is to be tilted in favour of the workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but Thursday’s working week is an endeavor that fits with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Greens also promised a Thursday working week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this effort is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “Wednesday working week is not party politics and the Party will not discuss it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to refine his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from “faceless managers” and “profit-earners” of utilities.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire shareholding, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” related to perceived misconduct.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and create participatory equity funds to give 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, instead of giving annual bonuses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in 60 Minutes about whether FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote to run for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could affect the cessation of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I was going to the interrogation. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be rock-proof.
“I am confident in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and that can only be changed by a bombshell,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not all who have been named by him were able to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival hosts an annual music event with tremendously impressive celebrity participation and an equally impressive goal: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, Global Citizen Festival is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to perform a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, call or do anything else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there are still 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to persuade them to demand action, or is it just another click snap where people feel they’re doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters in pursuit of a variety of goals.
According to it, these actions have helped global leaders to communicate commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion, affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their activities, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the guaranteed funds so far.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-implementer partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “helping children take full advantage of their abilities,” promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 activities calling for improvements in mother and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which reaches the 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements we face, we are confident in our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few performers performing at this year’s event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval “barrier” to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent a hit on the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially if it is at the request of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of Southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has this opportunity, with the help of our navy, to ensure that maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to reject the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, Trump said, turned Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has been set back by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem for me if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that his candidacy was under consideration.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the First Lady,” she said.
“After November 6, I am seriously considering running for president.”
Warren also evaluated President Donald Trump’s actions in the city hall, saying he “is taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
According to the Boston Globe poll, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the Senator shouldn't run.
32% voted in favour of this.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin Quotes About Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s Meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a case of domestic violence, and he was charged with
“What my son is going through, what he’s going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers are coming back,” he told an audience at a Donald Trump gathering in Tulsa, Oktahama.
Palin called the arrest of his son "an elephant in the room" and said, in connection with his son and other veterans of war, "They come back a little differently, they come back toughened up, they come back wondering if there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and regions made a brief statement in Washington on Friday to support a challenging policy on asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions suite, proposed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Union’s policy in August, has not been published.
She said she was abused by her accomplice “and her violent gang members’ sons,” but U.S. officials refused to accept her asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence in order to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General for Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “will disregard national, union and international law for decades.”
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," the court's friends said in a brief statement.
Lawyers also stated in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the U.S. economy is damaging, saying they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant shelter to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems—even the serious ones—that people face every day.
Amusing Rescue Operations in Prayer, where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforted her feverish little boy at an evacuation centre in the town of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance arrives.
There's not enough clean water."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through stuff and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including a fractured back and upper arm, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were still being treated outdoors for severe aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the ruins,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are not in danger.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “bullying with incitement ads”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily news about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to an add-on paid by the China Daily at the Des Moines Register, the state’s largest newspaper in Iowa, after China was accused of interference in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it’s common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to capture exporters from states such as Iowa because they supported the Trump Republican Party, experts from China and the US have explained.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as Terry Branstad, China’s largest exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an article by the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing incitement ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s expensive freedom of expression and free press practice by putting its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, there are only limited voices in the Beijing street stall and we don’t see any real differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans will alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting for and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a setback during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been on the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with voting.
These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute effort to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday—they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor to MoveOn, a progressive group and national spokeswoman.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated “November is coming!” during a demonstration in their Senate corridor as Republicans, controlling the Judge Committee, decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic instinct and internal persuasion are falling out of time,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters aged 18-29 who do not like the president and often abstain from voting.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a setback as the Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"It's become very confusing for the GOP," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve treated him,” said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided, believing Ford after the testimony and Kavanaugh, but a little more supporting the first.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other accusation against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judges Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals when they attended one of the parties while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet that will match Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is building the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to "govern the world."
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
This can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes this personal online database unique is that the user can choose who gets access to this information.
The company refers to it as “the granting of personal authority through data”.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to bring the company resources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired under contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with Facebook and Google about whether to bring about a complete change when all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Bath: a memorial stone to the Victorian Cross opened in World War I
The Church of England, which was the only one to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his badge of honor on September 29, 1918, during the attacks on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later, not knowing that he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons opened the memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “geniously symbolic” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and a round of guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it forward with “the greatest galaxie,” before he rushed to one machine gun alone and knocked three opponents out of their minds.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, when the war was only a little more than a month away.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather’s action was “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's Anglican Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to attend this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero is appreciated."
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw Pig Peppa
Imagine you've been up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but you won't be shown this main event.
The San Jose match included thirteen fights, including six from the main maps, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the audience in the United Kingdom was thrilled to hear Pig Peppa appear on the screen.
Many were not thrilled with this, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this very struggle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to children’s comics as “some kind of sick joke.”
“It’s a government regulation that at 6:00 a.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to take more into account the audience in the UK in the future.
"When I think about the playback now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show five – as we usually do – we tried to offer more to the fans and we just went over time.
This is a difficult situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Felt 'Undervalued' About Sexuality
Olympic diving champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone isn’t like him.”
While attending Lauren Laverne’s Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Becoming a parent also changed his attitude towards winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was not so important anymore.
The usual long-term host of the show, Kirsty Young, had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that when he grew up, he felt less valuable than others because it wasn't socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said, “Until today, these feelings of being unworthy and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something" and did not disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Bronze Olympic winner has become a highly regarded leader in the LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she was talking about it because she was lucky enough to be able to live an open life without consequences and want to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "found him surprised."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“If you’re going through so much when you’re young” – she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later – then it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “all outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row because by then you’ll be gone,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first choice of songs – Heather Small’s Proud – which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still provokes her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson removed from the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays every two years for the record 12th time, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s doubles and four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner split his day in two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hopes of improving it.
Never the most direct kicker, not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is particularly unfit to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long, harsh trail constantly punishes missed shots.
And if the pitch itself isn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinar in his ninth race on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
When the Americans, who are behind at the start of 12 singles games with four points, start fiercely, the Mickelson race can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but had nothing more to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He is very self-confident.
He is a celebrity and has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I was looking forward to more, but it went like this, and we had to choose one of these paths.
He wants to be out like everyone else.”
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday as the highest player in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional spiritual input.
"He's funny, he's ridiculous, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the teamroom," she said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was great to see it.
It’s a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead may soon disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the Ryder Cup’s great leadership at the start of singles can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made his public appearance at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where, along with Captain Seve Ballesteros, they held a five-point lead over the Americans, but when they reached the finish line, it was drastically reduced, winning only with the result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You will even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had a great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this win came very close,” Bjorn said after winning Class of 2018 on Friday 5:3 and yesterday’s success at the 10:6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we focus on it.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who our opponents are – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush things.
There will be new obstacles tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be a day of personal performance, so it’s something else.
It’s nice to be with your opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you have to give to the players – do your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's going to have to go and do it himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better personally than with their opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both during these last days, being part of Brookline’s winning team before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the “Miracle of Medina.”
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start fiercely, like in Brookline and like in Medina.
If the momentum goes in the same direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average race.
We will set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the pitch in a way that we feel will be a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race, and he is in the best-run with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the race.
"I put my boys in that order because I think that's how we're properly covered," Bjorn said of his single-player selection.
Germany's new warship has been delayed.
The German Navy’s latest fast sail was supposed to be deployed in 2014, replacing outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, local media said.
The launch of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fast sailing flagship “Rheinland-Palatinate” has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the outdated Bremen class high-speed sails.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some masking technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to send the latest fast sails out of the home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which promise to strengthen Germany's power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The unsuccessful F125 was reported last year when the German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware shortcomings" that rendered the warship unusable if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of the older Bremen class fast sailers.
It was also revealed that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to incorporate future innovations.
With a weight of 7,000 tons, the Rhineland-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training the team, becomes a problem.
It is said to amount to EUR 3.1 billion (<0x24> 3.6 billion) – compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the newer fast sails are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy is decreasing in capacity.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defence Committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy had actually run out of "removable ships".
The official said that this topic has grown as a snowball over time, since old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the speed sails of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
A study by Scientists from the Scottish National Trust tracks common and soprano pipettes in the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat screams and the activity of the species.
A map of habitats and a report are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by different species.
This information will help determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the bat population has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night-time hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, reviews, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only special bat range in the Threave area in Dumfrie and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
“At Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great good place to live.
But there is still much to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need.”
She stresses the importance of bat inspections prior to the start of maintenance activities on the property, as unwanted destruction of one gestation and delivery site could kill up to 400 mothers and youngsters, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy them.
Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Bat Defense Alliance has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said, “We still have so much to learn about our bats and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Plan to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations against him as a “fake word,” saying people “would want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>330,643.10 to stay away from the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In a live Instagram video of his 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) said it was “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What we're talking about today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
"I'm a lucky man and I'm fine," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “an unjustified suspicion of disclosure of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player was seeking “compensation for causing moral damage that corresponds to the severity of the violation, probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player’s hotel room where he was allegedly raped, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good man,” of whom “one percent is failing.”
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was afraid of “revenge” and worried about “public humiliation.”
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Italy in connection with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with giant Juve.
Brexit: UK may begin to regret car manufacturers leaving forever
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily suspend their production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stoppages without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures vehicles for Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt in the production process at our factory,” said Burnaston’s Toyota CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on demand, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement reached on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day’s supply at its plant in Derbyshire, and production would have to be stopped.
Theresa May Chequers’ plan for the EU’s future relationship is “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
"We need an agreement. We want the best solution that allows us to do what we want, and not only take advantage of the current success, but take advantage of the full opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be stopped, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a union spokesman for Unite, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our own experience that if jobs disappear, they won’t come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed by another week as the fight against top-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein will monitor the work of special commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the interference in the Russian elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor General and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has fuelled Washington’s rumors for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of eavesdropping devices to record conversations and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he didn’t want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with a hearing by the Senate Judges Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave IDs.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed by another week, considering all the matters that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep the press informed, as always.”
Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to deliberate disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been made to be disappointed.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president will do more question and answer sessions than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Question time continues, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen how we’ve done it over the last few weeks, so it’s going to be during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated, perhaps, why, having been on a free ride and sometimes strange-looking before assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU employees working for Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wishing them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent her letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of its established status for EU citizens employed in public services.
In his letter, Freeman said: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued this summer, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury and defeat on Saturday 31:27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the midterms.
"He fell on his side and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen while on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher and removed from the court for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV – Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie’s operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no details about the type or extent of the injury and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
A second-year student in a red shirt, Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State after crossing over from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which resulted in a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This step will defuse Corbyn's endeavor to attract young voters
The stamp tax is levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance is hoping to create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax rate if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp tax is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, diverting additional money into the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The surcharge – which is in addition to this stamp tax, including the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for second home and sublease-related purchases – can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this movement to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get under foot when buying a home.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He blamed large construction companies for keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but don’t use it, and called on May to give up quotas on affordable homes to improve Britain’s “dwelling-related shame.”
Corbyn has announced an eye-catching housing reform, including rent control and an end to harassment of innocent people.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers in the construction of new homes.
May said: “Last year I pledged to commit as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is true that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Sunderlan leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish (42) is delighted with the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached Class B and that was the end of it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up with my dad watching Scotland in Hampden, and that’s always something that has pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's leader have been Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he had no fear of such great and famous names, having previously endured in both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it’s a success at the moment if I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Champions League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I can only see myself succeeding if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, having previously been Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-level drop and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academics during his career.
"It was a real crossroads," he recalled.
“I really believed that driving was more appropriate for me than playing.
It feels weird because I managed, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some of the highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I’m still experiencing it with the tension and pressure of my work in mind, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to drive, and now I do. I feel more comfortable now than ever in adulthood.”

According to a study, the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in Britain, but increased pressure has been exerted on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the turnover of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a spokesman for CGA, said: “The continued sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, when pub sales grew by 2.8%, except that restaurants went even harder.
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8% in June and further deteriorated in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and restaurants that try to please the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food companies, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide some necessary relief.”
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, grew by 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related institutions.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found “fake Insta” leaf growth
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main account” to show their parents
The study found that one in five children, some 11-year-olds, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasts found a noticeable increase in “fake insta” accounts (a link to the Instagram page for sharing images).
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had both a “main account” designed to show their parents and a “main account” that they could accept.
One of the discoverers of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret page saw a teenager inviting others to rape themselves.
The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle Will Be the Spokesperson for Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of Scottish Athletics at the annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is respected across Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to the leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 and 400 metres and now shares his opinion frequently on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I recover, and if so, to what extent, only time will tell.
I’ve done a lot of hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared two camps on the Internet with advertisements comparing a nursing mother to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of “the world’s first silent wearable breast pump,” consumer-oriented technology company Elvie released a similar advertisement for the ironic music video to showcase the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who want to live out.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows and sing, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, these aren’t udders, these are my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the company’s advertisement on its Facebook page has generated conflicting opinions on the Internet.
Viewers of the video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and has thousands of comments, disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the backs of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen within days of birth.”
Elvie breast pump does not stick in the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these to promote the breast pumps of mothers who can keep their babies?”
Somebody added: "Absolutely incomprehensible advertising."
Some of it's in favor of advertising, and one woman thought it was a lot of fun.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfeed.
Pumping the milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but let's take it as it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement (often in their workplaces or toilets) for pumping mothers who feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they’ve all danced with non-spotting pumps put on bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and does not stand out from the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children, and even walk outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and annoying introduction.
By comparing women’s expressiveness and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children carrying designer Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the stage.
Thousands of Migrant Children Go to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of children of migrants arrested has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policy enforced by Trump’s administrator has made it difficult to set up children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country by claiming custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data were shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, admitted to Congress last week that the agency had arrested a dozen people who were seeking financial support for non-accompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are illegally staying in the country, and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we will continue to pursue them,” Mr. Albence said.
To deal more quickly with children, officials enacted new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest. Previously, shelter workers said it was 60 days later.
Many defend their legal content in front of the immigration judge by videoconferencing instead of coming.
Those who are unsuitable for release will be expelled quickly.
According to asylum workers and system reports released in recent months, the longer a child is detained, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a child’s difficulties can be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to a camp site without giving them enough time to get used to feelings or to say goodbye to friends can create a trauma that many are already experiencing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home after eight years of war.
Moualemi, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem claimed that Syria’s “war on terror is almost over,” with more than 360,000 deaths since 2011 and millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue fighting in this holy war until we have cleared the entire territory of Syria” from both terrorist groups and “any foreign force illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate, and he blamed the unreasonable fears that prevent the arrival of refugees for spreading to parts of Western countries.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their faces," he said.
“They are politizing something that is merely a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be given to Syria until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create an Idlib buffer zone at the last rebel base has created an opportunity for progress through political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread raid by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the three-million-strong province.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would hit the Nusra Front fighters associated with jihadists, including Al-Qaeda, who would be “destroyed.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convince a new committee of government and opposition members to plan a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel’s work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why is Trump elected for a second term?
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the resignation and scandal has not previously ended his presidency, as liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be the “most exciting ending of the presidency!”
At the moment, viewers are not showing signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen. The 3.5 million viewers of MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” via cable have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“It’s a tension that we’re involved in because we don’t understand it,” the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor said about the secretary of government who will become president when an attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovelli, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston in 2016.
The manager told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He said he'd make me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said to me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not like other TV shows, Washington’s rumors can become fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to wanting to reunite with immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the topic is only the luxury of privileged viewers.
But a six-hour expert talk show about Bob Woodward’s “in-depth background research” for his book Fear and Paul Manafort’s 13,225.73-dollar ostrich Bomber jacket (the Washington Post described it as a “over-confidence-breathing garment” or “over-confidential garment”), and Storms behind Daniels.
I will never watch Super Mario again.
“One of his actions that may seem like a reality show is that he shares something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series ‘Pandi Kings’, with the alternating actors and the day-planning pants of Trump’s performance (to argue with the NFL, Kim Jong-Kiun).
You can't miss a fight or you'll be out of time.
When he met Fleiss this week, his home on the northern shore of Kauai was 80 degrees warm, but he had slipped into the room to watch MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t stop watching Brett Kavanaugh cope on the Senate legal committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hanging over a head.
“I remember how we used to do all sorts of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Elsewhere, cash flows move to the hottest White House interim selection
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th District will receive cash flow due to the reorganization of the congressional area, receiving two dominant companies in the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic of Pittsburgh district was re-elected as the foremost figure in the suburbs, winning a seat in the second district in the emergency elections last spring.
The opposite candidate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania District 12, which overlaps with the new 17 in the larger section.
The maps were changed following a ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, causing the old districts to be divided into unconstitutional constituencies, favoring the Republicans.
The new 17th election has triggered a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties – the Democrats Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republicans Campaign National Committee (NRCC) – are struggling with money.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in the much-watched March 18th Pennsylvania Congressional Extraordinary Elections.
This place has happened to a Republican for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the division by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a small advantage.
El Salvador is punished for supporting China, then withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a Panamanian hotel until partners kicked out Trump’s corporate administration team.
Foreign Ministry officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama have decided to recall American diplomatic mission leaders after ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
However, it was only planned to punish El Salvador, which in 2017 received <0x24>140 million in American aid, including drug monitoring, development and economic stimulus.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high level of unemployment and the number of killings.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity to hold a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and end the debate on any El Salvadorian punishments.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized for speaking at a meeting in mid-October to discuss government positions.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh announcements or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of what three American officials had said, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on the request to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the demand to remain anonymous.
Teaching history
Next up, special prosecutor Robert Mueller may publish a report on Trump’s possible justice, which has a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress should change sides, Trump must report to this institution as if he were going to talk to voters and perhaps even his peer-to-peer judges again.
There are many, however, and I do not want to point out that the impeachment of Trump or his European counterparts is unavoidable.
We must all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were depressed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-year massacres.
History revolves around such turning points, and the ruthless march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he had made a secret proposal to save the president last year and speculated on his inadequacy for the post.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How do you react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle elections if Trump should be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter break.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me the light of Sabbath candles on a table with a hook.
With such a legacy, why shouldn’t I be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over Australia, which followed an impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become a European League G-Group.
Knee injury did not allow center player Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to get better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a strong opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we left the game by a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair outcome.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but because the people support us, I’m sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, because of that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the workout is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study participants said they would talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
But this is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of cost.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with financial value to help cover these costs, or property self-insurance – as long as you have the money you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles from the start.
Get yourself a health care credential to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes at a time when you yourself are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee in relation to your finances.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this down so that you are ready if necessary.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.”
The gun was fired several times in Ilfracombe.
He was shot several times with an air rifle when he was on his way home after a night outside.
In his 40s, the victim was shot in the chest, stomach and arms of Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon.
Police described the shooting as a random act at around 2:30 a.m.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths continues to increase.
Since the communication has been disconnected, the rescuers have received no information from the Donggala regent north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, in a narrow bay with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regency is an area that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, Regents, an administrative district under the province’s authority, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, over the past 100 years, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 in the west coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Indonesia’s most populated island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province, was hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Sumatra - Mentawai Island, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regent in Aceh, sowing devastation and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
The tsunami did not occur at the time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report, and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to report alleged crimes to the police, Palin took a phone call from her.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su investigation facility and is being held on an unsecured bail of <0x24>500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty under any circumstances," the network said.
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, was summoned by the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference in a domestic violence report and possession of a gun, all while in a state of intoxication.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which stems from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake followed by tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of Sulawesi city centre, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the town of Palu.
Federal prosecutors in NYC seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack
New York federal prosecutors are applying for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of being involved in a New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime committed since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the death penalty notice issued in the southern New York area, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily injuries in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, according to the court documents, there is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors for organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "intensive planning and deliberateness," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "horrifying, cruel and obscene."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the last death trial at the New York District Court.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed was in New York City in the 1953 federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when a couple were executed after being convicted in a conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he had told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov was accused of telling the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos watched on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
In the 22-point allegation, he has not admitted his guilt.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defenders, said they were “clearly disappointed” with the decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty prolongs the trauma of everyone involved instead of a life sentence without the possibility of acknowledging guilt,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory said NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during today’s Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics because one of her own parliamentarians, Theresa May, recommended herself to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative member of the House of Commons, said the UK would “be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling her deeply divided rows, highlighted by conservatives in favor of staying, joining the city in her anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track, amid Brexit supporters, ice-makers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite a counter-attack and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and "chaos".
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to “give up Chequers’ plan.”
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'We would be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough said: “I stand for Brexit, but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.”
He said: “We did not fight in the world wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’ll just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and elect us at all.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they stick to their promises.”
Farage said the politicians at the gathering should be "feel hot" if they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let that happen.”
In his message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal, feel uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the nation’s national army that gave us victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering held in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved “Truths Against Brexit” slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they faced when opening the conference for their party's application.
“These are the people who say they can get IT systems in place and take all the technology to Canada and more, smooth border crossing, cross-border unrestricted trade to Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after November elections
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the West Massachusetts Town Hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for office in the next election in November against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he may be opposed to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, that is, also for the First Lady.”
LSU Sims Shooting Arrested
L.A. Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said the suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson around 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking the cameramen to help identify the man.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died afterwards," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge police station.
The nearly two-metre-long young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the first division, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and having 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team records gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s ranking plays a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxing stops and left the rear end of the Hamilton group in a hectic traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after being side by side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner side free to pass after attempting to defend it in a double-shift on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round for his 21-year birthday.
He then led the race most of the time, driving towards the finish line with the tyres whining and passed Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
At the end of the race, he reached the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the speed in the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Valtteri worked hard all week and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
"The team has done a great job of having one of the two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford’s testimony directly to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “cruel, disgusting and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that’s happening right now in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see anger and angry, evil, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks, people say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak a document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Hold on a second.
Whether we leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the senator’s face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the allegations against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said: "I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations or leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep confidential, and as he asked, I did.”
But his denial did not fit the president, who commented during a meeting on Saturday: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see this vileness and disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to ride over to get the power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in a rematch on Saturday, losing to Dundee 5:3.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equated Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league. They came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee with a score of 2:1.
It was the fourth match of the season, in which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in the fast first third at 13:10 before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie score a draw goal in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer made sure the Giants would lead before the first break, striking the second goal of their night at the end of the first third.
On the home field, the players gathered again, and Bouchard put them back on level, defeating the numerical dominance in the minute 27:37 goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a leading position for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing a victory in the last third of their team's attack zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after giving his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami that left more than 800 people dead, many of whom remain missing.
The area is plagued by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped under the ruins in the town of Palu.
Despite colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung escaping from the swinging flight tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the flight tower, thinking it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Kalimantan to Balikpapan to another major hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Palus.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it,” the spokesman added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to thousands. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said: "The number of deaths could increase because the bodies of many of the victims are still under ruins and have not been rescued."
6-metre-long waves ravaged the town of Palu, where mass burial takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we can’t say what they might find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “Please work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready for this?” said CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini Airlines Says One Man Is Missing After Lagoon Air Crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airline that piloted the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to find one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions concerning the passenger’s details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane crashed over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low when it landed.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to wade through the water at the height of their waist to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he had suffered a minor head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors working on the nearby quay also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the aviation safety network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered with PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst prepares schedule for the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed on Saturday a re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spent hours analyzing intelligence as an expert observer.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said she received location information from several mobile phones showing that she was with Chambers the night she died, which was in contradiction to the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the courtroom on Saturday and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said that Tellis “lied because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that the couple had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, she erased Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
Kaitsel plans to make his own speech on Sunday.
The judge said he believes the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from the beginnings of solving its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to hip hop roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York Babysitter Sues Couple for Racist Message
A New York nanny sues for discriminatory dismissal after a couple of accidental messages from her mother complaining that the nanny is “another black.”
The couple denies that they are racists compared to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that Giselle Maurice, their new childcare provider, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying, "EIIIIIIIIIIII, ORDINARY BLACK SKIN."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Ms. Maurice after she understood her prohmaka, claiming that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been expecting a Filipino instead of her.
Miss Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple in court to get compensation for the dismissal he wants to receive for the next six months in the amount of <0x24>350 per day, and the same job he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them to look, so do," he told The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that terminating employment with Maurice was a reasonable act because they feared that after insulting the girl they could no longer trust him.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t think about.
He's not racist.
"We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you allow your children to be held by someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the baby and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you go against someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, public opinion has swiftly condemned the couple on social media, where they are heavily criticized for their behavior and thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Relate to Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so much fun to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, inspired to write a children’s book about the little bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a nuisance due to his father’s death last year.
Concerning Paddington, whom he described as a “very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and not a bragging person,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a feeling when your child accomplishes something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not directly your accomplishment.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that the daughter was in a very bad condition and that they did not believe she would survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes and I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now all the systems started to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experiences.
"Nobody knew that," he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their beloved to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have glued cards to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said her smile would make the whole room shine.”
Despite this, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a very bad place with himself.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to contact and talk to, even with a friend.
“Don’t be quiet, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything," he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on the first Christmas day – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the whole family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance while the FBI opens an investigation
"I believed that if we could actually get what he wanted -- a limited time and scope investigation -- we might be able to achieve unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "fall" in the midst of a permanent partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The midterms are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't go as well as expected, they'll be greatly weakened in their intentions to get the man they want in front of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "decreased" number of deserters under Kim's regime
South Korea’s legislation says the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said that compared to 2011's exiles (2706), their number has declined last year (1127).
Mr. Park said the key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Koreans have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area located between the two Koreas.
China takes deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their home countries by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of stalled nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they pledged to work towards a broadly nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of failing to make progress on sanctions.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security, and under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's unfit to be a Supreme Court judge
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi spoke in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I inevitably noticed that if a woman had performed in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time and remained speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party who were on the committee, calling the allegations against him of losing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election “a grotesque and coordinated reputation killing” organised by angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was not fit to be a Supreme Court judge because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifiing himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would attempt to remove Kavanaugh from office if the Democrats were to gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say as much — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only fit for a Supreme Court judge, he’s not fit for the court where he currently works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade (the legal case-law on abortion) because he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical biased person to become a judge and wait for us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’”
Women have to wear it.
It is just wording, months and years of overwhelming anger, and he cannot escape it without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said she was crying as well when she got angry, but she worked out a method that was that when she got angry and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly accepted as an outlet of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying in indescribable anger when an older woman – a strict driver I had always feared a little – grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and that’s what makes them happy.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the man's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board an out-of-law love story called Monkey Business and ended the campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he shouldn’t think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said laughing to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was for someone else to join.”
Someone said it was like “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late in raising money, and he vowed not to run unless he received a total of <0x24>2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch an official campaign, the feelings – gratitude to the people who supported him, irritability to the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates, and hatred for sexism – overcame him by tears in his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press to him.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsorship company.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening ties of the U.S.-China trade war were deplorable, and while the battle is far from over, experts say that a country-to-country split could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning shot this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on <0x24>200 billion worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of Chinese goods entering the United States.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently with tariffs ranging from five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised the U.S. a shot at each other, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean yielding to demands, but bowing down publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing makes its maps right, a trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause another country to lose control of the economy is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugees
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and is asking for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods to be able to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team at the Le Golf National Golf Course near Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was involved in the entire tournament, hit a brick in the water on par-3 lane 16, ceding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have scored 5:0:0 in the tournament's current format since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated with 5&4 by Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest player on the European team.
World's best player Dustin Johnson beat Englishman Ian Poulter by 2 and 1, who may have been the last to win the Ryder Cup.
The eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European to win the contest with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It’s a matter of team spirit and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said.
He passes the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I’m extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France and now has a 13:21:3 career result in the Ryder Cup.
Strange stats for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major event titles, lagging behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was struggling to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointment: “I’m proud of the guys, they were brave.
There were moments in the morning when we were putting pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, I'm working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're moving on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We need to lift the hat.
We played better.”
New information on aquatic blooms: concentration reduced in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows an overall decrease in the concentration of blooming algae in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of more incomplete blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, suggesting decreasing concentrations.
The extent of the flooding is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Spots can be found 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer spots than last week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations on the coast or offshore in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations offshore in Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations in Sarasota County, and high concentrations in the coast and offshore in Sarasota County, high concentrations in the coast and high concentrations in the coast, Charlotte County, back to medium concentrations in Lee
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, reports of respiratory tract irritation continue to be reported.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
