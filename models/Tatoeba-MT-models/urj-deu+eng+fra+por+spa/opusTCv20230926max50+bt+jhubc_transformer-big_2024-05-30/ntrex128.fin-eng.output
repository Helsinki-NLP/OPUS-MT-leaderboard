Members of the Welsh Parliament fear appearing stupid
Some members of the Assembly are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP, the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The protest started with a plan to change the name of the congress to the Welsh Parliament.
Regardless of the party stance, members of the Representative Council are concerned that the change may be a mockery of them.
According to a Labour representative, the group is concerned that the name “rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid representative, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
A Conservative party spokesman said his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but pointed out that there is a short verbal leap from MWP to the word for fool.
In the Welsh language, the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment necessary for the change of name, said: "The final decision on the titles of the members of the Assembly is, of course, for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, which showed widespread support for the designation of a representative body as the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission favoured the title of Members of the Welsh Parliament, or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could be a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a legislative amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the loss of office and the form of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, members of the Assembly may give their final vote on the title by which they should be called.
Macedonians to vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to "Northern Macedonia Republic".
The referendum seeks to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed its aspirations for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Bells Quiet as Harlem Churches Live in Difficult Times
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that there used to be a bar or church at every corner of the street,” says Adams.
"Now there are none of them."
He said it's understandable to lose bars.
He said, “People’s relationships have changed.”
“The bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by dwellings and apartments that are not populated by people who support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black residential area - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's central shopping street, against their opposition to recruitment or promotion of blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, and when parishioners in Father Johnson planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a tower bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell "the bell of the proletariat."
The expert who played the tower bell game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the world’s first tower bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex swirl involving architects and contractors hired by the lay leaders of the Church and the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy — a governing body composed of the congregation’s lay leaders — wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would “try to roll out the expenses” to the sacristy, even though the sacristy had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency with regard to the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old lobster shark injured in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB TV that he had dive with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was only excited after catching the lobster, but then realized that he was shouting, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!"
After reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reportedly critical.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to her upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments with expert advisors.
This is a significant move for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow even though the sales of fashion and homeware are declining. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are being invested because supermarkets tend to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s beauty product portfolio is doubling to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees also gain more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas in the same way as Boots stores do.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain will try out rental shops at two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift from grocery shopping to small one-time shopping in local stores force supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by increasing their services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company says that this has promoted food sales and made the purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the acquisition by Sainsbury's of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an impressive beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to shop.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby retires from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home appliances and accessories label for Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby annoyed Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" at last Tuesday's tense meeting at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for Truly, their brand of home supplies and accessories.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was clearly Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in amazement.
No one had believed what happened on Tuesday so close to the release.
The Marlow headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold."
This Morning host is one of the UK’s most promising stars, and experts say his departure could cause the company a million losses due to product investments ranging from pillows to candles and clothing to household items, not to mention the delayed release.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Capp’s Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The couple are on holiday together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked as the new M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business.”
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comments, which some would find inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be the “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He noted Kim’s interest in meeting again after Trump’s announcement of the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Nuclear talks, however, have been stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a “similar reaction” from the US to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He said the United States would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"North Korea is doing very well," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
He said the efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, with the missile tests being stopped, the hostages being rescued and the remains of American soldiers returned to their homes.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside with 10,000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island, Hundreds Dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required by international aid was not declared, even though about 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a group traveling back to Finland, it is not certain that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Nauru to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature in view of the recurrent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return was likely due to the missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in force.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even in the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way back, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the worn-out infrastructure in Indonesia the focus of his election campaign, and he has contributed money to improving roads and railways.
However, Joko’s administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
Tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority in the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion, also add to the pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought with jungle knives, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of people displaced.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge topples a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League on Saturday after painting for 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing the goal.
He moved the ball to the left before sweeping the shot towards the rear post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball dropped over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play up as much as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match in the 1–0 half, after painting Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic a no-show in the situation before slipping near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic played a high-speed wall pass in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a gorgeous pass.
Hazard escaped from the defense and passed Liverpool with a shot at Alisson Becker's left foot in the back corner.
Liverpool faces the Champions League in the group stage at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency reported early on Sunday that the number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Office spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Phuhan, which had a population of 380,000.
32-Year-Old Man Arrested on Suspicion of Murder After Finding Woman Killed by Stabbing
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning opened a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all taxi drivers, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation."
A police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who might know the woman have come to the crime scene and asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim’s family about the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
An officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tear-stricken woman appeared at the scene.
He repeatedly said, “It’s awful.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two harbours in the isolated area, and a third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament was part of the rewriting of history.
The eviction of the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatical puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious monuments like the best of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "rewriting history".
The chairman of the Cromell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about the removal of the statues would make a target for the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell reflects 19th-century opinions and is historical proof of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the nineteenth century than today, regard Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, was caused by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
At least it is certain that the dispute of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell, in turn, must be a recognizable figure that represents the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a steward deserve praise and commemoration."
Killer pig kills Chinese farmer
Local media reports that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in the Liupanshui marketplace in Guizhou province. The man had a broken artery and was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The herder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of a nearby pig farm open.
In the pig, he said he saw a large boar with blood in her mouth.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the death of a 250-kilo-pound swine in a grocery.
Guiyang Evening News reported that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
A security camera shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it wouldn’t hurt others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
A farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 after the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are usually not aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
“They’re just playing.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, at 5am east coast time on Sunday, and it was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
When Rosa arrives in the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins pushing deep tropical humidity northward towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rainfall areas southwest in the coming days.
Locally between 25 and 100 millimetres of precipitation cause dangerous heavy rain floods and potentially landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimeters of precipitation per hour in certain precipitation areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In certain areas of the south-west, and especially in Arizona, it is expected to rain as much as 50-100 millimeters.
Heavy rainfall floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rainfall.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Precipitation of more than 10 millimetres is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Scattered tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last the whole Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. will see strong fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the central United States, there is an excellent example of a major temperature difference on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The stagnant summer heat will again tend to intensify and expand in the next few days.
The beginning of October is expected to be extensively warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, temperatures could drop to +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance that the temperatures in the eastern United States will be above average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched a six-channel TV show on Tuesday in which Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford testified.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the broadcasters interrupted their broadcasts at a last-minute turn, with the FBI conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations on the basis of an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% confident that Kavanaugh, who had been intoxicated, grabbed him and tried to take his clothes off in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony in which he said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than Nielsen's 20.4 million on Friday.
The company calculated average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other broadcasters such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure the viewers who watch in offices.
Something about the proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators at an American football playoffs or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the highest number of viewers was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
On Friday, Flake was at the center of the drama.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how protesters' screams led him to the elevator on the way to a hearing at the Justice Committee on Friday, after the moderate Republican backing had previously announced that he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN watched him stand for minutes with his eyes down as the scorns flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he'll tell the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” he was told.
Mr Flake said his office had issued a statement and added that before the lift doors closed, he had more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks streamed live as the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to put Kavanaugh's nomination to the vote in the Senate plenary.
However, Flake said he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing it with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her resignation from the EU of threatening Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview appeared on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan, calling the proposal that Britain and the EU levy import duties on each other "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting and death of 20-year-old Wayne Sims, who played basketball at the LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation in which they said Sims had lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayden during interrogation.
According to Advocate magazine, he was bailed for <0x24>350,000.
East Baton Rouge County's coroner released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement officials for their "intensity and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning he was "horrified" and "shocked" by Wayden's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered in 24 hours.
The centre registers thunder and vibration several times.
In residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City, images of car windshields covered by a thin layer of ash were published on social media.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 kilometres southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists and police meet before independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday in a clash between independent protesters and riot police. Thousands took part in contesting demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
The police detained a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police to form dark dust clouds in the streets normally filled with tourists.
During the day, more clashes broke out as the police used their batons to restrain the bodybuilders.
The clashes between the pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "Long live Spain".
Local press reports that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during demonstrations.
Tensions are still on the surface in an independent region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declares illegal, but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although the turnout was low when opponents boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside on Friday to block a national police protest.
The demonstration took place, but had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck in our seats,” he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory in last December’s regional elections, the pace of Catalan parties for independence has faded this year. Many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a police-supporting demonstration on her phone, said politicians on both sides of the riot.
“The situation is getting tighter,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who have been detained for nine years, announced that he would participate in next year's European elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could have been shot with a crossbow.
Livingston defeated the Rangers 1-0 with a Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Livingston astonished the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt's team reached the split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed their first guest win in the Premiership, and next Sunday they face the series leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his unsuccessful tie in the league for already six games, but Head Coach Holt has not lost a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats against a visitor who lacked a blade
Holt's team should have led long before their goal, having caused the Rangers a lot of trouble with their straight lines.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow managed to slip into Craig Halkett's butt, but managed to pass the ball.
The hosts handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate in special situations.
An important goal came out that way.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
By then, the Rangers had held the ball, but said the home team held the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly allowed to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, despite the fact that Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to reject him.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow passed the ball for another Livingston special situation.
In addition to the need for a penalty kick in two situations - Halkett's tackled substitute, Glenn Middleton, and the ball that hit his hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent to every player, continuing on the upward path.
The way the team plays and their crew hasn’t changed much since it’s returned to the highest level. However, Holt has to be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was thrilled to lead an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but is now far from his standard.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial German visit to rebuild relations with NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press, as well as on Turkey's aspirations for the EU.
Erdogan travelled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a group of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, arguing for security reasons, but many supporters still gathered close to the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurds - also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of opinions, and some Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others defame him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10 a.m. local time in the south-west section of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is heavily trafficked.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist had died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Unrest
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the high-security riots in the prison.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30am British time on Sunday and continues.
Tornado Special Forces have been brought in to appease the unrest behind eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have received treatment for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
The prison director was reported to have been hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to serious unrest in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert with the risk of heavy rain flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of heavy rains on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50-100 millimeters of rainfall, while the Mogollin ridge in Arizona can cause up to 150 millimeters of rainfall.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are likely to be produced, with total rainfall of up to 100 millimetres.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing in a drought-affected area if there is no risk of heavy rain flooding.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains can be beneficial because the South-Southwest has suffered from severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes a landing on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa’s location is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still as strong as a hurricane at a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico during a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In parts of Mexico, rain can be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the Californian peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters are possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in tropical low-pressure Tuesday morning hours. From there, she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest risks for Rosa or its remains are likely to be associated with extremely heavy rains in the California Peninsula, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4am British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reportedly in a 'stable' condition.
Police said they had arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset.
The police are requesting contact with anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Experienced “Badness and Anger” of Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the “malice and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he vigorously and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage” on that day.
"A vote in favour of confirming Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with excellent merit in public service," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
“I’m not just campaigning, I’m campaigning,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats had taken on the task of “resisting and preventing.”
A senior Republican leadership assistant told CNN that Kavanaugh’s first major vote in the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, number of deaths expected to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed on Saturday after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the festival on the shores of the city of Kahului, when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many were washed to death by the waves destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them as victims,” said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses and hit the whole country," Nugroho says, adding that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Office of Disasters show several destroyed houses and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain at the end of a long and narrow bay in the city may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damages could be greater than Return to 300 kilometres north of the coastline, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications are “completely broken and no information has been received from Donggala,” Nugroho said.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami hit Return, although authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is eagerly shouting warnings to people on the street about an imminent tsunami.
Just minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage, which cut communications around the area, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by means of transport planes, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Kahula on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
World Vision’s Donggala staff have been brought to safety in the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in the tent shelters in the office’s courtyard, passing the scene of the disaster, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As the relief teams began their desperate mission, some complained that foreign relief workers were being prevented from traveling back.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, equipment and staff from abroad can only start flowing once the affected area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the second night landed on Luhan after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing ones cherished the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian suspension team, had trained two missing hangers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi says.
"As an older member of the hanging joint, I have my own emotional burden," she says.
Gendon said he had desperately tried to reach the competitors at the beach festival via WhatsApp after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the halibut community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray marker appeared instead of two blue ones.
"That means, I understand, that the messages could not be delivered," he says.
Thieves Take <0x24>26,750 in ATM Supplement in Newport on the Broad
On Friday morning, thieves took <0x24>26,750 from a security guard at Brink's while he was completing an ATM in Newport on the Leve, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and completing an ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While the attention of Brink's employee was distracted, "a man ran after him" who stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses said they saw several people fleeing from the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Anyone with any information on their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “A character formerly known as Kanye West.”
Ye has been the nickname of 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him, in addition to being an abbreviation for his professional name.
While discussing the title of the album earlier this year with radio presenter Big Boy, West said, "he believes that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and that's where it means 'you'."
"So I am you, we, and we all.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which only embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is a reflection on who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner JAY-Z has also occasionally deleted and returned the connecting line and the capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approached its 50th anniversary of student retaliation.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student support and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for AI research
The U.S. should double its funding for research on artificial intelligence as China intensifies its efforts in the field, according to Kai-Fu Lee, a financer and AI professional working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by announcements by different parts of the U.S. administration on AI, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China already presented its plans last year: it aims to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publisher working as the CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the highest-ranked player in the United States, Othello, and later served as the executive director of Microsoft Research and Google's China operations director.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says US scientists have worked hard to get public support.
"Academic influences are not taken by China, but by large corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think doctoral graduates in artificial intelligence should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
China’s Government’s next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Defense Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House has announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill aimed at establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum to change country's name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country’s aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments reached an agreement on a new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% threshold for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price so that Macedonia, which has collapsed from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can join both the EU and NATO. .
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote for it to have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on a name change for Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents set up by boycotters in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, such as China and Russia, as part of the integration process in the euro area."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe a large majority will vote in favour of the name change, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that the “yes” is “a solid foundation for our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute pointed to a turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - that is, below the required turnout.
In another survey commissioned by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must exceed 50% with one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government after it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat Brighton's defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the game, the Argentinian top player received a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by storming through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He missed one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a right-angled shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that “Aguero has problems with his legs.”
“We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
Yes, it did.
Fortunately, he scored in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the Sky Blues an advantage in the Premier League.
The game was played in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane made a few contacts before sending the ball to the rear post towards Sterling.
The Sky Blue striker punched the ball into the grid just before the finish line.
City will face Hoffenheim Champions League in group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why try to force yourself into the starting line-up?
However, Scherzer, always as competitive, hopes to take over the assist in Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have one win difference to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western league.
The Rockies got at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Even though we don’t have a stake, we can at least get up on the pit stop knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver creates for me the most demanding race scenario I’ve ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their startup for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a rehearsal session on Thursday, playing his 34th game at the start and pitching on Sunday with his regular rest period.
Washington's right-handed player has a win/loss ratio of 18-7 this season, with an ERA score of 2.53 and has burned the batter to the base 300 times, with a draw score of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The President implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“All of our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the full, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by any means, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to crush to get to power, that's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "resisting and preventing".
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hateful and evil and malicious and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-established Democratic senator in the Senate Justice Committee, the audience responded with loud booms.
"Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, um, no, I'm expecting a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant community.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions.
I was not really surprised when my local party’s Momentum activists supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the latest in a line of Labour to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way simply because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, Fridays in the Party Council have been exactly that.
Today, many meetings do not follow that tone, and the 'more friendly and gentler' policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that each opinion is judged by whether it is appropriate for the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Mr Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I shared a similar political view, began to expect from me a turnaround and statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, be it in terms of national security or in terms of the European internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - the result is a wave of insults on social media, calling for my election to be reversed, rejecting centrist politics and hearing that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my own experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are, after all, political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults on a daily basis and never fail.
The normalization of ill-treatment is one of the most disturbing features of politics in this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the electoral rule, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I’ve been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “all goes well.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of the failure of the Thatcher Government to do so, I have been working, both as a city councillor and as a minister, to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never concealed my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the constituency of Nottingham East has been surprised by my points of view or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, as the state moves towards a Brexit that will hamper households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy in questioning my trust in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the advancement of my political career will not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in block tip
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a victory in the entertaining Tennant's Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost a single game.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be rightly pleased.
“We’ve been challenged in our matches and we’re still invincible, so I can be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says, “All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.”
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over by the Warriors to the match, allowed Melrose to climb, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime, he scored a goal and managed a conversion kick, raising Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, where in the conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and dragged out of the pitch. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with a goal from Stafford McDowall, whose conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal that failed to convert.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal at the back of Ayr's flavor.
Climo succeeded in the conversion in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and pushed Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game Star Begins Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actress plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source in the Scottish Sun magazine hinted that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.

The naval bases from the Titicaca to the Amazon have been slammed with the slogan: "The sea is fairly ours.
Getting it back is our duty.”
Inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource war is still strong – as is the longing to sail the Pacific once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, unity and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Several Bolivians around the country are hoping to follow the decision of the International Court of Justice from the big screens, hoping that the Hague will support – at the end of decades of intermittent debate – the Bolivian position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic President Evo Morales, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in the line-up for next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin has no jurisdiction to extradite Chilean territories and the ICJ has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is issued just six months after the last statements indicates that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia’s goals.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the issue of maritime connections," Zárate said.
Morales’ rhetoric has stifled the remainder of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations thereafter.
Neither country has had an embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
“North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington,” North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said in a statement.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore summit.
Ri’s statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to resume impasse diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a “distant dream” to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Until Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is cautious about the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up the arsenal of weapons that the state probably sees as the only real way to guarantee its own security has been widespread suspicion.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large-sized hats that will soon be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t need to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of extravagant oversized headgear at their SS19 show that dazzled the fashion circles of Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also posted their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather line, which covered the ends of the models almost entirely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewellery stones, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and a mask was more like a diving device, and the other one was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand on big-sized fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves will appear on the street.
The exaggerated-sized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-metre cradle, which has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult fame of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also swept another large creation into fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as big as the model that wears it.
The most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week was the raffia bag with white leather hand straps.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the street next summer – the designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The educational achievements of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. This success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by SCIS, the Scottish Council of Private Schools, strive to provide a high level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for careers of their choice, for postgraduate and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an actor in the education sector that can design and implement tailored study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, the message goes to their heads.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message goes to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s latest test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of the pass rate among private schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that 72% of pupils with the highest grade A studied Mandarin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are valued in the same way as science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey commissioned by the UK Employment Office in 2014 found that 17 per cent of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote young people's future career development.
The more possible jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey commissioned by YouGov, 75% of over 4,000 British adults are unable to speak a foreign language, and French was the only language to be understood with a two-digit figure of 15%.
This is why it is important to invest in language teaching for today’s children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there are always several language options in private schools taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as 'international communication skills'.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high standards to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of SCIS, the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron will make his debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans of LeBron James's first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he actually plays will remain to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the rehearsals, was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games ahead of the Lakers season.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-match preparations," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five elections planned for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the vacancy for a Supreme Court judge, Trump tries to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in November's election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 7 p.m. East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event live streamed on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became the subject of heated sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate’s reinforcement vote for a week as the FBI investigated the allegations.
But the primary goal of the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
Thus, commenting on President Trump’s campaign, the purpose of these five events next week is “to awaken volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so essential to his interests that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign term," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's venue is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and fans can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has lagged behind in polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in polls," said political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates willingness to fight for hope before Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon doubles were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-confirming power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and more so in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this power of success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we take this success force as a hint," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot to be encouraged about, like Spieth and Justin Thomas’ condition, which allowed them to play together all day and score three out of four points.
Spieth has been overwhelming from brick to green, and leads by example.
The roaring cucumber sounds of the victory celebration intensified as his round progressed, as he managed to make a critical putt to level the match exactly to four, while he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The put they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed the US team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and just take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet duo of Europe has won four out of four without fail.
"Moliwood" was the only duo that did not make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this turbulent audience, confirms that they are the favorites of Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no more popular player to secure a possible victory for Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, the talk of success in Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren's paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning's doubles.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into the pit that they were not even close to surviving.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and doubles are fascinating to watch closely from the perspective of couples working together: what kind of advice they give or don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken on a remarkable lead before the last day, but this doubles match showed that the US team has a willingness to fight, even though it is suspected, especially in the US.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after taking 10-6 leads from the United States in four-ball and four-play on Saturday.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the triumph with two victories over rapper Tiger Woods, reaching a high score of four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who struggled so hard to keep the victory he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-playing US team in the morning's four-ball, bringing the match to a 3-1 position.
The United States was a tougher opponent in the quadruple, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow their lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12th singles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively called "Molliwood", were the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they then finished the overwhelmingly discouraged Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two games, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and doubles, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning's four-balls, but returned to the doubles with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, both first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Triple prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2-1 win over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in doubles after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point chase to the level at the start of the singles, although a tie on Fury’s side is enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of second best, Sunday’s counterattack may be too much to ask for.
North Korea says it will not disarm itself without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States, and under these circumstances, there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that over the past year, North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain that national security will be maintained, so in such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington does not accept a gradual nuclear disarmament that rewards North Korea for every intermediary, his statement is significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament is not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-North Korean presidential summit in Singapore on June 12, in a statement Kim pledged "to disarm the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump pledged to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed alleviation of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States demands ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even opposing the ‘declaration of peace’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party calling for disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the missile targeting of the U.S. into continental areas was inevitable after the “evil president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” with suicidal intentions.
Even last year, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea. However, this year, Trump lauded Kim for his courage to approach disarmament, but he stressed that there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he had no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be vigorous and unsuccessful until we prove a complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting the funding channels for Pyongyang’s production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Ri on the occasion of the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea denounced Pompeo's "gangsterish demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes “similar measures.”
According to Pompeo, Kim means “with similar measures” the security guarantees Trump undertook at the meeting in Singapore, and a move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take A Course Instructing Sufficient Rest
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University will take part in a course designed to increase student rest. The course is a setback to the university’s flourishing macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant about the basics of their own well-being.
Designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the course is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler had an idea for the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deficiency on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why do I only hear about it now, in my final year of school?'
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I found surprising,” he said in an interview with the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right unity habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and vice president of health services at the university, said the university ended up arranging a course after hearing how students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during their study week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behavior.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know about these issues just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a matter of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state in the brain that resembles starvation, which is why people are constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave him the impetus to organize a comprehensive course for all the students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students could complete a similar study package before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning, and also advises them to keep in mind the adverse effects of “blue light” on the circadian rhythm caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took away Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox players were claiming their first victory since the 4–1 game against St. Johnstone in February. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second defeat in his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points behind the current Premier League leader, Hearts.
Menga shot the ball to the finish line seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' fallen will to fight did not equalize the situation after that.
As a result of the game, the Rangers dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and only Hibernian is up in the goal difference.
The Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the stands hit his head, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that had beaten Ayr and advanced to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up that the team used to take the point from the Hearts last week. The same strategy again yielded results as the well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better at using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had an opportunity to score in just two minutes, when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free pass for Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to seize the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide into the rear post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but during the last third of the game there was no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment after he and Steven Lawless bumped into each other by fifteen minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly rejected Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's helpless shot.
Livingston’s goal in the 34-minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn’t just the team’s hard work.
The Rangers still couldn’t do anything about Jacobs’ long pass tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly took the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the relay, Gerrard decided to replace Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the pitch. The relay affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's impressive speed of defense.
Livingston made the visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes one after the other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense blocked Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had changed the Rangers, also demanded a penalty kick after confronting Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the gauge also became the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Clocks of the Coronado" in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray quite cowboy-looking scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones in your ears, you can really hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now it's really rattling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ proteins typical of several cancers
The dog vaccine has produced promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost cancer cells within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells.
In this method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers. The modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Our results show that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "This includes breast cancer, as well as ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach —to take resistant cells from a patient and teach them to attack cancer cells— has also yielded results in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was criticized for praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat.
The show didn’t go as planned.
Kanye West was booed up on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump and announcing he was running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" on Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often, when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, which relates to allegations of Kavanaugh's sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's speech was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a snippet of it to social media.
It's unclear whether Rock's intention is to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated for wearing a hat on the back of his head.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll say I'm in the margins," West said in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be in the margins?" and says he's wearing a Superman cape because "then you can't control what I'm doing.
Try it with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments blew bubbles from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of the attendees described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was short-listed to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who praised her bravery on Twitter: “Thank you for endangering the wrongdoing.”
But Karen Hunter, who led the talk show, tweeted that West "is just herself, which is absolutely wonderful."
“But I can choose NOT to support a person (by buying his music or clothing brand or supporting his ‘art’), which I believe supports and spreads an ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, and the musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabber charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area.
The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones actress Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging heroic role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
Harrington, however, has attacked the machosan stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” in the matter, questioning the ways in place to tackle toxic masculinity in the era of the <0x23>MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who has recently been married to Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old member of the Game of Thrones, admits he has a strong desire to address the issue.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity at the moment stirs up strong feelings in me," she says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to the problems we are now observing?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be of a certain kind to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something is really wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer because, according to his own words, he “has had enough of battlefields and horses.”
In November, Harrington will appear in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the film producer and his robber brother.
The actress recently revealed that getting to know her future Rose wife was the best that Game of Thrones has offered her.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie starred as Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow in the Emmy-awarded fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The overwhelming majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which represents a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of HIV infections that have occurred in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infections are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator information and accuses of spreading “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that her employee had published personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles said the allegations were spread by “extremist right-wing” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information were the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person released the information from the U.S. Congress on Thursday during a hearing in the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that Hillin newspaper reported that the messages were published from an IP address linked to Waters’ office and by a member of Waters’ staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie," Water said.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters’ statement quickly attracted criticism on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
“It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason for defiance.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters in the midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Mr. Waters said he had “contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies in response to these fraudulent accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are legally held accountable for any destructive and dangerous actions against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – underpowered Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It’s already a well-established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that’s leaning slightly towards the UK, but this doesn’t seem to fit into the Johnny English parody and action comedy series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with the sequel “Johnny English – Reborn”.
Can the tongue-in-the-cheek national satire become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, Johnny English, with his dick-eyed, cumin-faced and incompetent face, has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His very name suggests, above all, that this is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside of the English-speaking world.
This is, of course, the dumb secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe glamour, but shows up as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unfortunate single-note musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical world man Atkinson portrayed in the originally forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter wearing medieval armor and his helmet is hit by the rotor blades.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts are coming out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and oddly unnecessary, especially since ‘serious’ movie brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English’s insane treatment doesn’t seem to me as inventive and insightful as Atkinson’s Mr. Bean’s silent roles comedy.
Every year, the starting point is that the UK is in worse trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field to the dismay of a working agent – a feature portrayed as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunately small role.
This is the last straw for a pretentious and struggling prime minister who is already in the bog of political dislike: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can in the skins of Teresa May, but the script just doesn’t give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been exposed, someone who has already left active service must be called into distress.
Of course, it’s Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a teacher at a fancy school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the nobility of spying. The subject rips off some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets again his endlessly patient battlemate Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine seems to be out of his way.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to His Majesty's secret service to face the fateful super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately turns into a farce: a duo disguised as waitresses sets fire to a fine French restaurant and creates chaos while secretly trying to find Volta's luxury yacht.
The authors’ last inhibitions will slip into the final scene, but despite all the power and charm, the film still feels a bit like it was made for a children’s audience.
The movie can be considered moderate.
When I watch Johnny English movies, I’ve come to the same question: why isn’t the British film industry able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with a five-day salary
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that would allow British workers to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party is said to demand that business leaders pass on the savings of the AI revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends for the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would ‘fit’ with the Party’s economic programme and its plans to tilt politics to the benefit of the workers.
The trade union confederation supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source told the Sunday Times: “The revision of the line should be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but the four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party has pledged to support the move to a four-day working week as part of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective will not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and the party is not considering moving into one.”
Treasury Secretary John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “increased dictators” and “speculators” of non-profit corporations.
According to the plans of the Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their shareholding in full, as the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee control, with a maximum annual dividend of GBP 500 per employee.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as Supreme Court Justice for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In a 60 Minutes episode on Sunday, the program's correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out things that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I told you on my way to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied it sharply," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which takes place in New York on Saturday, is a music event with an impressive line-up of performers as its mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
This is the seventh Global Citizen Festival to attract tens of thousands of people to the New York City Central Park grasslands to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Power Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to an event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform various tasks or “deeds”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker or making a call, or perform any other act that spreads awareness of the goals of the project.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that it’s only 12 years away?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one of those ‘clictivism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “deeds” for various purposes since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which have been spent in ways that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than <0x24>10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”. The group committed to deliver <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and global citizens just like you, we can bring social injustice and malnutrition to the press," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told an audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also called upon to take action to improve mothers’ and children’s nutrition through more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition, reaching 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult and there are many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show at a New York concert this year, and its star squadron includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The U.S. Department of the Interior says the country could hamper energy exports by using the navy as a "barrier"
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, said Washington could “if necessary” rely on its navy to prevent the spread of Russian energy on global markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are a pretext for exploring new energy markets in the region.
“I believe [Russia’s] reason for its presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinken said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep its shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by blockading to ensure that the energy they provide does not enter the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers’ Association, a non-profit group profiled as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it was one and the same thing.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with a situation where the Trump administration has sought to increase the efficiency of exports of LNG to Europe and replace it with much cheaper Russian LNG.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s opposition is based on purely economic reasons and considers it an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a reaction in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, Will Consider Carefully “Candidate for Presidential Election in 2020”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “think carefully” to run for president after the midterms.
Warren confirmed he was considering running for the Open Questionnaire in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's women's time to move to Washington and fix our faulty administration, and this also means a woman in the leadership of the kingdom," she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president.”
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump during the event, saying that “he is taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
According to a poll published on Thursday, however, the majority of Warren voters are not in favour of this candidacy in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk Department of Political Science and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of a senator's candidacy.
32% voted in favour of being a candidate.
More than half of the respondents voted in favour of former governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Her Son's War Trauma at Donald Trump Election
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Armed Forces in September.
Track Palin Arrested on Monday and Accused of Domestic Violence
"From what my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can identify well with other families who will face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers will suffer," he told an audience at the Donald Trump election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "a river horse in the living room" and said his son, like other war veterans, "come home a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if it's honoring what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated, according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have filed an appeal against a new U.S. policy to refuse asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and federal districts have filed a letter in Washington on Friday in support of non-compliant asylum seekers, according to NBC News.
The full name of the claimant has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against a federal policy.
He said he had been assaulted by his partner "and his sons who belonged to a violent gang" and was denied asylum by US officials on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a widespread problem in all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision of the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards state, federal, and international law for decades.”
"Bundes law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of facts and circumstances specific to the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," says the letter "Friends of the Right".
Prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of denying asylum seekers access is damaging to the U.S. economy, as the newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring the additional workforce needed.”
In June, public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“The asylum is intended for people fleeing their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social affiliation, or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even the serious ones— faced by people all over the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palau – the number of deaths has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while calming her febrile baby at an evacuation centre in the ruined town of Palu.
"Ambulances are bringing in new bodies every minute.
There is very little clean water.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their wet goods, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for constant, strong aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted how a violent earthquake shook a fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save.
I'm stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris tells Associated Press, and tells me that he was in town with his family as a wedding guest.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Provocation” with “Propaganda Announcements”
The US Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a tool for propaganda, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited a paid appendix to the China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register newspaper, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the congressional elections on November 6, China has denied the allegations.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the US elections mark a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-increasing trade war in which both sides, in turn, impose tariffs on the exports of the opposing party.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-time Governor of Iowa State, said Beijing had damaged the working population, farmers and businesses of the United States, a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in an opinion paper published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the prestigious traditions of free speech and the press in the United States by putting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, in the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, there are only limited differences of opinion, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly in the leash of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that “one of China’s biggest newspapers evaded an offer to publish” the article he wrote, but does not specify what newspaper it is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco bans female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republicans are standing behind and defending Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh may, according to analysts, cause a reaction, especially among female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding the case have gone on big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)’s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokeswoman for the national reform group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming" as they protested in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even greater, especially among suburban insecure female voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president.”
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court candidate in which he made his allegation of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be questioned, it's about how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic-backed Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should trust Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony when the latter is inclined by a narrow majority.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony absolutely or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh absolutely or likely.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
With Flake pushing the case forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford swore before the judiciary committee that Kavanaugh was abusing him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for Supreme Court membership revealed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet as a counter-attack to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's goal of "dominating the world."
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse” or POD.
It can include contact lists, note lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal repository is that it is completely up to the user who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through information.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some paid developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this will be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all of their business models are turned on their heads overnight.
“We’re not asking for their consent.”
In an article in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the new Solid-built grid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city commemorates the heroic priest of World War I
The city celebrates the 100th anniversary of the events of the Church of England’s only victories-cross medal-winning, military priest.
The Courage Medal was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann died four days later, never knowing he had received the highest honor in the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line and, "with the greatest bravery," led the advance of the troops before raiding alone on the field cannon.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s deed was “something I could never achieve, something that inspires respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a wreath after a parade performed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's a "great honor to take part in the parade" and adds, "a great number of people are there to commemorate the glory of a true hero."
Free-fighting fans waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the television channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night to watch the anticipated Bellator 206 tournament and the whole event isn’t shown.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, six of them in the main series, and was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to a great dismay for the spectators of Pipsa Pig.
Some of the spectators weren’t really happy after watching the game all night.
One fan of the martial arts game opened up on Twitter describing replacing the match with a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to the law, that content was not appropriate to be presented at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained.
Piss Pig, yes.
Director of Bellator, Scott Coker, said the schedules will be worked on so that British spectators can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission, which will probably make the program work," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning there and we won’t be able to show the program before Sunday for our time, which in turn is Monday for their time.
We are working on this.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to move in one direction and the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more, and we tried too much.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he only realized when he went to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about gay rights to give ‘hope’ to others.
She also tells how after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a long-time radio presenter, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne’s first show, Daley said he felt younger than everyone else because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work.”
“Until now, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I’ve needed to thrive.”
He says he wanted to show that he was ‘something’ so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and will appear at this year’s Commonwealth Games to call for the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
She said she came out because she felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "as a surprise again."
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age," he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find another person of the same age who's experienced the same kind of good and bad," Daley said.
The couple gave birth to a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal,” he says.
“You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son was named after Daley’s father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about the 2012 Olympics tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wasn’t going to be there anymore to be in the front row,” Daley said.
"I held her hand when her breath stopped. It was only after the breath had really stopped and she was dead that I finally realized that she was not invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the air – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which evoked emotions as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin on chicken.

Half-fit for Mickelson bench at Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round on Sunday, but he has to make a significant effort to avoid the record round going down in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in a two-yearly event for the record 12th time, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk for fourball and foursome on Saturday.
Usually the center of attention, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the pitch trying to get hold of his punch.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National, where a tall roughhead punishes inaccurate punches.
If Mickelson doesn’t have enough on the pitch, he will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, playing alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to win all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when entering the 12 doubles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game may prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in the player, but what else can be said about the situation.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He clapped me on the back, squeezed me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo’s record for more Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something indefinite to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to make jokes at people’s expense, and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes to be around,” she explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week, so it's amusing to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s vast lead before the final day’s doubles can become a tumultuous journey.
A Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win with just his nose and win with the narrowest possible margin141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds us of how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit scarcely," Bjorn said after watching the team's 5-3 wins in 2018, both on Friday and yesterday, moving to a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
“History will show me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll fire a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're going to do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and that is all we aim for.
As I’ve always said, I’m focusing on the 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at how his team players have managed a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I drop off on things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, the priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re alone on the pitch, the player’s ability is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform best.
Now we have to give up the partner who can go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full turnaround of the last day in both directions. He was a part of the team that won at Brookline before he ended up losing when the European team won with the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question about how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw put his team in line for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to have a fast start, just like it happened in Brookline, or just like it happened in Medinah.
When you move it in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our team accordingly and we’re putting the boys on the pitch the way we want, as you know, we’re going to do wonders tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned to lead the defensive battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to face their European opponents.
"I put the guys in this order because I think it's going to carry the whole tournament," Bjorn said.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been deployed in 2014. The ship is intended to replace an outdated Cold War fleet, but it will not be deployed until next year due to faulty systems and exploding expenses, local media reports.
According to a military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit, the commissioning of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the ambitious project has been haunted by worrying after-supply problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
According to the information available, they will be equipped with effective cannon, missile systems for combating aircraft and surface craft, and concealment technologies such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal detection.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting their home port.
However, the persistent delays mean that state-of-the-art warships – which are said to be designed to enhance Germany’s influence in overseas territories – are already obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit points out.
The unlucky F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the vessel since its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the restoration, but the German media has spoken of essential "software and hardware failures" that make a warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half the crew size of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's chances of subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tons, Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to weigh twice as much as German ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price tag of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to an astonishing sum of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to an initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have arisen as the German maritime power has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, said earlier this year that the navy's "usable ships are running out."
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time due to the decommissioning of old vessels but not the replacement of new ones.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to enter the fleet.
Environmentalists are eavesdropping on the hidden lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland observes bats and dwarf bats, as well as earhooks and water wings, in Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species involved are confirmed by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report are created in which the bats’ behaviour can be represented in a scale-based picture.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are exploited by different species.
This information is useful for planning habitat areas such as meadows and forest management, taking into account bats and related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
Construction and civil engineering work threatens bat resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo-location technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental protection organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of rest areas and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only area dedicated exclusively to bat protection in the lands of Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway areas, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species are found.
According to David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave suits bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before restoration work is undertaken, as the destruction of one bat resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and young and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is forbidden to kill, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stigmatized allegations of rape as “fake news” and says people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim <0x24>375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram live to his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer drastically rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
“What they’ve said today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, it's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they have called “unworthy reporting of suspicions under privacy protection,” according to Reuters news agency.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into a player’s room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to papers submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent a good guy,” but that “one percent” was disappointing.
Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later came to a compromise because she was "horrified of the possibility of revenge" and worried that she would "be the subject of public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now claims to seek the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to an agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault on Manchester United, and moved to the Italian club Juventus with a <0x24>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “repent forever” of the end of car production
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “concerned” about the announcement by Toyota’s UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of border delays will be reflected in job losses if Brexit is reached without an agreement.
The plant in Burnaston – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union in terms of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern, according to car manufacturers, concerns supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars are manufactured on request.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible to keep a stockpile of more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant, and production would be suspended.
Clark said Theresa May’s EU relations plan was “exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need a deal, we want the best deal possible, which is not only a success in the current situation, it's an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but also the statements from other manufacturers show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the supply chain series that have worked very well so far.”
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be halted, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union officer at the factory, says the concern is growing among members: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred another week” around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to a thrilling obligation, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference in the elections, the ties of Trump’s assistants to Russia, and the president’s possible actions to obstruct justice.
It has been rumored in Washington for months that Trump plans to fire a deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s impartiality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, and the possibility of the president’s dismissal under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House on Monday, and the meeting was said to have been aimed at Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “not prefer” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News’ Sunday show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed another week because of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the shortage of press conferences was due to reasons other than dislike for TV journalists' "attention-seeking", but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him," he says, and without even quoting more evidence: "We've checked those numbers."
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better for the media to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you’ve seen us do this many times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Speaking alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have pointed out the reason for this when he appeared unblocked and occasionally strangely to journalists who had gathered there.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding their fears about Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written a letter to Scottish health system workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
The Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent the letter after less than six months to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applying for a "established status" for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: “During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal withdrawal.
I know that these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution made by each of our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed on it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on the stretcher and taking him aside for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State spokesman told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information at this stage on the type/scale of the injury," and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first season in a team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
The amendment aims to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
Increase of stamp duty for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when buying properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to taxing the high-income.
The increase of the stamp tax is aimed at people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money is channelled into government actions to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge – which will be added to the current stamp tax in addition to the increases in second and investment dwellings two years ago – may be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He blamed large construction companies for keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to remedy Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including rent restrictions and an end to “confidential evictions.”
He would also like to give councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
May said: “Last year I said I was going to devote myself to the restoration of my British dream as prime minister – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, to purchase housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, having a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is thrilled with the challenge of lifting the team home to the north-eastern corner of the country back on their feet. The team currently ranks third in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the Lights Stadium this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my team.
I got into team two and that was it,” Ross said on BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I used to watch Scottish games with my dad in the Hampden, and that’s something that’s always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his famous predecessors in the famous club. He has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“At the moment, I’m measuring my own success by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
With the club’s structure and ability, it is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful if I could pilot the team back into the Premier League.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the third-season drop-off games and raised St Mirren from the fall-out position to the championships in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a crossroads with my career," he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned fairly well and enjoyed some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
Players have to deal with a variety of issues each week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but it feels like the right job to lead a team.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do my job, and I feel better in my own body than I have ever felt in my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., research shows
The summer heatwave has kicked off pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: “Continuing sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July became like June, with pub sales growing by 2.8%, while for restaurants the month was worse.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the beverage side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurants’ sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than restaurant runners.
It seems that people just wanted out drinking in their minds.
The sales of pubs and bar beverages operated by the companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and there was a 3% decline in food sales."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hotel and restaurant consultancy company, says: “The results continue a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are increasingly the main factors affecting sales in the out-of-home meals market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual decline in sales is particularly painful now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have been worse for food-focused actors, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures in August will bring the industry’s desperate need for a break.
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-Fifth of Children Hide Social Media Accounts From Their Parents
One-fifth of children, some up to 11 years old, hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, according to the study.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexually explicit content
20% of students say they have a 'main account' that is shown to parents
One-fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of fast-growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content may be published on accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they want a cleaned 'main account' to be shown to their parents while they use other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after stumbling into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Advisory Board of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people aged 11-18 kept two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "Voice of Athletes" to Scottish Athlete Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athlete Board as a non-executive member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, describes the nomination as a great opportunity for sports decision makers to benefit from the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I'm sure the Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from appointing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I look forward to playing my role as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can be useful and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction.”
The four Olympic gold medal winners, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient circulatory disorder of the brain.
He tweeted, “A month ago, I had a stroke.”

Doctors say it's only time to see if I'm gonna recover and in what condition.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and now I am already training for agility!

Advertisement for mothers and cows to share opinions online
An advertisement similar to a dairy cow for a breast pump company has shared opinions on the Internet.
Consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has launched what is known as "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by a cheek-on-the-cheek, styled music video ad describing the freedom the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with songs such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but I can't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not the udders, it's the tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page provoked discussion on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has provoked a controversial reaction among viewers, and many say it’s a joke about the dairy industry’s daily ‘horrors’.
“Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after delivery,” one commenter writes.

Another viewer commented: “Obviously, it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The third commenter added: "A completely reality-obsessed ad."
The ad also got advocates: one woman admitted that she thought the ad was “funny”.
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilets) and 'feel like cows'.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced with discreet pumps in their bra.
The advertising campaign concept is based on the idea that many women using a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump into the spotlight, bringing out the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in an entertaining and identifying way."
Elvie's pump's been in the headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children performed on the catwalk in a designer’s outfit, Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult for children to be placed in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrolling as foster families can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified at Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minor immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to speed up the treatment of children’s cases, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which in some cases the case has to be heard in court within one month of the arrest, instead of within the 60-day time limit previously in place, according to the reception centre’s employees.
Many prefer to appear via videoconferencing rather than in person when defending their case before a court dealing with immigrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be expelled as a matter of urgency.
According to reports released by reception center workers and the system in recent months, the time children spend in prison affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s despair may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent towns without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children suffer from trauma already at this time.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to leave immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also deputising for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "with them they will act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and thereafter, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would “continue the holy fight until the whole of Syria is cleansed” against both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign forces.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops in a battle-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for a return, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politizing something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebels' last base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political debate.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area of three million people.
Moualem, however, has stressed that the treaty has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters on the Al-Nusra Front, "which will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new government and opposition committee to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the dismissal and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of best viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its highest viewing time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is a blaze that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, chief producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor program, said of a minister who will become president after the attack destroys a congressional building.
Nell Scovelli, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the global economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of a panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward’s source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich-skinned pilot jacket (a “studded garment of arrogance,” according to the Washington Post), and the consequences of the uncut descriptions of President Trump’s anatomy.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario like I used to.
"What he does feels like a reality show, because in part it's all about giving the audience something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the pawnshop series, about the changing characters and the daily changing plot twists of Trump's show (NFL dispute, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you're gonna fall out.
When I caught up with Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a lovely sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he was watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not disconnect from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flows from outside for tight midterms
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania has faced a real flow of money, as the reorganization of the congressional constituencies has forced two already elected candidates to fight for one seat.
This newly re-established Pittsburgh constituency is a challenge for the Democratic Party, Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency in last spring's special elections.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, overlapping with the new 17th constituency.
The division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district division favored Republicans in an unconstitutional way.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar in Pennsylvania after the March special elections in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been in the Republican seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have come a long way for the Democrats.
U.S. plans to punish El Salvador for supporting China but backs down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the slight reaction of Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization executive team was expelled by partners.
US State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized," U.S. Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step forward in attempts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the meeting wanted to proceed and this effectively put an end to speculation about a possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give some kind of signal to the mid-October meeting about the weight the administration gives to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the regime, who also spoke under the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next unavoidable step may be a report by specialized lawyer Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reportedly directed an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign worked in secret with Russia when Russia interfered in the U.S. elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his electorate again, and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I don’t mean to say that the defeat of President Trump is inevitable – no more than the defeat of its counterparts in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable march forward of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been under fire since the news came out that he had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and considered the president's possible inability to perform his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
"What will we do if the newly demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by a swastika.
How could I be anything but optimistic about the future with this legacy?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month, a victory against the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the pitch this season before Villarreal 2-2, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old said.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we could have caught it at the end of the win, but overall, a tie is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got into the second and we were better.
On Thursday we have another big night in the European League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can do everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is going well.
Hopefully we can now push to the top, leave the past season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings deprives women of sleep
While the participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
Approximately half of the participants in the nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of the respondents said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you make your wishes known in time.
Talk with the professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost determinant.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options can include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-cost insurance, if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on site so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer any questions about her medications and allergies?
Write down such information in your plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just a financial issue. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.

Who takes care of the dog?
“Keep the plan ready.”

The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palau in Indonesia on Friday. Authorities say the number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to the lack of communication with the area, the emergency services have not received any information from the northern part of the area of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface centre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located in the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and a tsunami hit the city in the middle of its 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the island of Sulawesi on the northwest coastline.
The municipality of Donggala is a provincial administrative district with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The most important economic activities in the central Sulawesi province, and in particular in the Donggala coastal region, are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, there have been several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of the victims in the Aceh area.
2005: A series of violent earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south side of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands in Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that devastated several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface quake struck Aceh in Pidie Jaya, causing devastation and panic in the memory of the massive devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
The Alaskan police said on Saturday that Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and preventing and resisting domestic violence in connection with his arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from his female companion when she tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial, and the bail is set at <0x24>500, according to KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "promisingly innocent."
Palin is accused of three class A violations, which means he can face up to a year in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B offence, for which he can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotic drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting him in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections have been cut and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
An earthquake hit the north-eastern side of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, just outside the center of Sulawesi.
There are videos on social media from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Põle after the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Consider Imposing Rare Death Penalty on Suspect of NYC Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with using a Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the New York Southern District death penalty application, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to sentence both of these charges to death.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 charges, including eight murders for aiding a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases involving organised crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", prosecutors noted and described the way in which Saipov committed his actions as "horrifying, cruel and disgraceful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last time the New York Southern District Court has handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in the federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to spy for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that his actions felt good, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired by the authorities after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to 22-point indictment that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers representing Saipov, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that will only prolong the trauma of those involved in these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked that he be exempted from the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the civilian army” in a protest against the conservatives.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said the UK would be "out by now" if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But as May settles the gaps between her deeply divided rows, she faces a challenge underlined by the conservatives in favor of staying, who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback – and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the Chequers proposal away.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough spokesman added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He declared his opposition to the EU: "We did not wage world wars to end up in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denounced the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “That the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false statement.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’ll just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither will the party members nor the activists, who are actually going out on the streets and are responsible for our success in general.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, she added: “The prime ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would have to feel pressure if they were to reverse the 2016 referendum decision.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to water up Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to overturn Brexit to feel pressure from you.”
“We are going to mobilize the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is once again an independent, self-governing and proud country.”
In the meantime, supporters of staying march through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get the IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus and the smooth border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
"There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his recurring criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump’s term.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was “the time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest position.”
Arrested in the LSU Sims shooting
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims.
Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man.
The Sims, 20, were shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present, holding a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
The Sims was a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team arrangements are playing an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the pole and almost left Hamilton to defend his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and left Hamilton to drive the team with the tail, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the depot later in the lap and came back after Vettel, but Hamilton moved by after some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up defending his position after only two thirds of his move.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race, prolonging the tyre change, aiming for a quick finish and taking the fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually came to the depot in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps when Räikkönen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job by winning a double,” Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of people’s “malice, malice and dishonesty.”
“That one possible thing, that wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest,” he said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you announce this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you get the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whether we...No, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as he wished."
But his ban did not suit the president, who commented on Saturday: “I tell you, that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suspected that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They're determined to get back to power by any means.
You see that meanness and that meanness, and they don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of Friday's Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back together before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard evened Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced for the fourth time in the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pass. David Rutherford bait when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the opening season, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched Cownee's handicap goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants for the first set break by striking the night's second goal at the end of the first set.
The home team folded and Bouchard scored again with an overwhelming goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score Dundee's first lead goal at the end of the second set.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
The pilot died while making sure that hundreds of passengers on board were able to escape the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the flight pilot has become a hero since his death, making sure that the plane that carried hundreds of passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing since the earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are ravaging the area and many people are trapped in the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in a wildly waving control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed in his seat and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said Agung’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter made it back.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, as disaster authorities in the country have reported inadequate contacts with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of victims is still rising because many bodies have been buried in the ruins and many people have not been reached," Office spokesman Sutopo Purwo said.

The head of the International Red Cross Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it could turn out to be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in a speech to the Armed Forces: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say one person is missing, despite earlier reports that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to locate a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find him in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane drifted over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, the passengers were able to wade in waist-deep water for emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the passengers panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were repairing a nearby dock were involved in the rescue work by carrying people ashore in a rubber boat before the plane sank into water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been associated with the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial in which he was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in data analytics.
He described to the jury how he used the data stored on his cell phone to compile the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had violated her previous allegations with Chambers the night she died, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned him.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the cell phone records, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed Chambers’ text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defence’s closing remarks are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from the original, with messages about politics and social issues.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York Babysitter Sues Couple for Racist Text Message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory separation after accidentally receiving a text message from their mother complaining that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her regret when a new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, arrived at work on her first day at work in 2016 and realized that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, again dark," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But then, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that his previous African-American nanny had done her job poorly and this time she was expecting a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance and wants <0x24>350 a day for the six-month period he was originally hired to live and work with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to the racist allegations, saying that Maurice’s termination of his employment was a legitimate decision because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco said in an interview with the Post.
“But would you leave your child with someone you’ve been unkind to, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco compared the challenge to blackmail and said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Should we start chasing someone else in such a situation?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, undermining their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared The Audience Would Not Identify With a Speaking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: “It’s hard to get into the position of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now that Paddington’s huge popularity is known.”
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bittersweet because his father died the year before.
He described Paddington as "a very important member of the family" and noted that his father was quietly proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a bragging type," the daughter said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's accomplishment to him, something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own work.
I think that's how he experienced Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was rushed to Nice after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and saying that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter would die in a couple of minutes and I would have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors used to keep her heart running gradually vanished from her body.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything passed out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was going to end.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, grieving for the loss of his daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with other passengers - who knew nothing about the trial he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
“I kept my head down and the tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Grieving Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number for support.
Davis' son Tyler became depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with a catchy grin.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that her smile would light up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before dying because he felt he was in “darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old younger brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of repercussions.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies's for many years, and he lost his partner Mark shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened their presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
Mark’s death has been a trauma for them, but they have to make it through: “It’s breaking up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI opens its investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a time-limited investigation and an investigation of its scope - we could perhaps achieve a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "disintegrate" into a stalemate caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is poor as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the country’s supreme court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush’s time and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
In the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will be held.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game off and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees drops during Kimi
According to South Korean lawmakers, the number of people who have fled to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying that there were 1,127 leaks last year, from 2,706 in 2011.
Decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases for human smugglers.
There have been no public comments about Pyongyang.
Most North Koreans will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often forcibly returns them.
Technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on stalled negotiations to crush the nuclear arms race.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a general approach to nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for stalling sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm our weapons," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the issue in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if she had behaved that way, she would be called a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of his own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed with emotions and at times he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak as he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democratic members of the committee, without calling the self-accusations “grotesque and planned persecution of the person” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential loss.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Mr Pelosi wondered if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats could get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently works," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Felosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders regarding health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known for being a conservative justice practitioner.
During the hearings surrounding his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
“It’s not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we’re expected to say that’s great,” Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech, over months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was tremendously helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her interlocutor in a situation where she was angry and began to cry, 'You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are justified as a way out of anger, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is when I once wept speechlessly in rage and an older woman – a cold-drawn boss I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me by the neck and pulled me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’ll be happy because they made you feel bad.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated to think that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates, and the least we needed was one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the campaign period was already long, he was lagging behind in the fundraiser, so he announced that he would not enter the race unless he could raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He realized that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates <0x24>1,000, gave him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not launch an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his emotions - his gratitude to his supporters, his frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters' and not delegates' election work, and his hatred of sexism - that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone would be cut into a memorial.
“He was crying.”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war was inspiring, and while the battle is far from over, a break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, the experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s most important export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week occurred with new tariffs affecting imports of <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all Chinese imports to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time with the same amount, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5% to 10% on US imports worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-for-eye fashion, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power is fading away for a moment.
In order to make Washington retreat, it would be necessary to give in to its own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the countries.
“A short-term political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than spectators have so far realized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says "Ready" for Refugee Return
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
The conditions now allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful to help rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with 16.5 points against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team retained the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament, and he hit his start in the water on the 16-hole of Par-3, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 against Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said Garcia, who was moved after winning the European team.
He transfers the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"I am very proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange stats from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 big victories and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding lanes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team at the games this morning.
We fought.
Honour to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving on.
These 12 guys are awesome and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta get my hat.
We met our winners.”
Situation of Red tide algae bloom: concentrations decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the number of algae is showing a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The Red tide algae bloom extends along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Ferries can be spotted ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tide algae blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the Pinellas County coast last week, ranging from low to high concentrations on the Hillsborough County coast, from background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota County, from background concentrations to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from background concentrations to high concentrations in Lee County Coast and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
During the last week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
