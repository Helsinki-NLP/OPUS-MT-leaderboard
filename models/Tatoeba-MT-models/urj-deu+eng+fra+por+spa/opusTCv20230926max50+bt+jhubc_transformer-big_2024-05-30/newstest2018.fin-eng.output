Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient reports hang from the ceiling of the Project room at the Academy of Fine Arts.
They all have Camille Auer's name on them.
The papers tell a long story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Deciding for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal medical history so that the violence of the process would become visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-long research period that involves meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnostic studies of "gender identity disorder", which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before that, he had already used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and was already well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process in order to be able to legally correct the gender.
Translaik, or transsek sualin sualin laitos (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to get the right sex, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
At the moment, every sex corrector is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive incapacity.
You have the right to decide your own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," Auer said.
The reform of the Trans-Law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight remarks on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns entered the government.
The law change is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government regarding the amendment of the law,” said Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International’s Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of these consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient story installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the psychologist of the transpole of Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on this, he wrote a report that would define Auer’s right to care and help.
The sense of reality to be studied is prone to vacillating.
The subject’s perception of self appears fragmented at the limit state level, and the unstable personality traits are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
Even more shocking was when Auer was not given sex-correction treatment.
The nursing staff said his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpo lounge of the television.
Later on, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any woman at birth can enlarge her breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts," Auer said.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything other than the number of your gender at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of sexual correction is more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
The participants will meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy for people who need support and help to be denied treatment on the grounds that they don’t have enough resources,” Auer said.
Many people who have applied to the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
On the basis of these, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
“Preventing treatment and help can push a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and that's something that people usually find difficult to digest."
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, I felt better.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had already existed in childhood and adolescence.
Why the wide chin didn’t seem to fit into your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using the voice and moving around," he says.
Today Auer feels already seen, she exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you are missexed.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they don’t agree or can’t internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, you cannot get official confirmation of your own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination of the legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identification number, indicating that he or she feels that he or she is of the other sex.
After a six-month reflection period, the applicant will confirm his or her application in writing and the Ministry will give him or her a new personal identification number.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition also crystallises this requirement.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still plays a role and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil rights organization issued travel warning to Missouri
The National African-American Civil Rights Organisation (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the state.
“NAACP’s travel release for Missouri enters into force on August 28, 2017, urging African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling to a state that has recently witnessed a series of questionable racial events,” the organization said in a statement.
The recent law in Missouri makes it more difficult to bring discrimination cases to justice, and the state’s laws are disproportionately enforced against minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are being stopped on the basis of skin color and beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, to the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of as many incidents in as short a time."
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization’s first warning about the state of the United States.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by the Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
According to the Missouri Attorney General, police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by taking money with them to pay bail or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, an organization that defends constitutional civil rights, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations, according to the organization, this will increase racial profiling.
While travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and apply to other countries, they have recently been issued by NGOs in response to specific laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (c.) who is responsible for state ownership steering has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the Minister, this is in contradiction with the State's declaration of will.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130,000 received by Vauramo came out this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it will give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has outlined that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s general decision on corporate governance.
Sanctions immediately intensified.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be on the way from cold to warm.
The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the occasion of the G20 meeting in Hamburg seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
Russia reacted bitterly to the new economic sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
According to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the sanctions signed by Trump mean “a full-scale trade war.”
Even if Russia’s reactions were to be offset only by political rhetoric and exaggerations, the tightening of US-Russia relations is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Although Congress passed the law with a remarkable unanimity, the president was said to have found it much more difficult to pass.
Trump has criticized the law as “significantly inadequate.”
The reason for President Trump’s boredom was probably Russia in particular, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must have been disgusting.
As is well known, an investigation is underway in the United States on both Russia’s possible interference in the presidential elections and Trump’s campaign’s ties to Russia.
The tension between the US and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed frequently and various scandalous developments have almost been revealed, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia's relationship with the United States is a chimera, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state like Finland, which has a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The impact of the US sanctions is still unclear.
There are fears in the EU that sanctions will hamper the operation of many European companies.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions, for example, of liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-thought-out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
The White House now has a Statue of Liberty in sight.
Interfering in the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, fell Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a discussion about the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
In 1903, a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the statue – 17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller told Acosta: “I don’t want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
Lazarus’s touching words are the only ones of their kind where the state calls not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teming shore.”
The poem is more topical than ever.
He made it clear that the "poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of the broader political and cultural controversy over the significance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the foot of the statue, and they knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to illustrate the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: Mother of the Exiled.
Attaching the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalist ideal.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthpiece that can now be regarded as some kind of prediction about Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives, taking the torch of the United States into a dark-covered world: “Lady Liberty steps out.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
That’s not what Trump and Miller want.
Their torch does not show the way, but fuels the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, head of results of the British Athletics Federation, says the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are a “significant confirmation.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which begins in London on Friday.
According to Black, "something special is happening in Scotland," which British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what's going on," Black said.
“I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation believes it is related to the activities of the Federation,
and the British Athletics Association believes it is based on their activities.
And the average streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s something great, whatever the reason.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
“His speech as a captain was incredible,” Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh’s words had a real sense of passion and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medallist for the Commonwealth Championship in the 400-meter hurdles, and this is his fifth World Championship. In his opinion, it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven between 1983 and 2015.
Mid-range runner Laura Muir has held five UK and two European records in the past year.
He competes in London in 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs the 1,500 metres in London and is also worth keeping an eye on: he has had an excellent season behind him, which includes winning the UK World Cup qualifications and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "very proud" of having so many Scots with him, some of whom are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
"It's a great honour to be captain, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle said.
“I’m very proud of all the Scottish teams that made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as merited athletes competing for prizes.
The Captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I was just focusing on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be amazing.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism must have annoyed me.
He did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led foolishly and silently like sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked them.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
Her staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also undermined online.
"What does it matter? It's just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the remarkably popular Republican governor of the Democratic-dominated state.
He is ranked second among the top 50 governors.
Hogan is not responsive to hot water.
He has led the state steadfastly and has adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users entering the governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was merely a matter of moderation.
However, stigmatizing commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to leaders of their choice, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, considerate and proper.
The pastor cited the Bible in his comment; he wanted to invoke Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely said I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments to the Washington Post.
'I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be somehow an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.'
The governor's staff called the comments "a centralized attack," and someone else could call them "a centralized attack" to promote what they thought was important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to control by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It’s the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the matter was made last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, a judge at the District Court of Alexandria, said the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Union went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Republican Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be difficult.
Low-cost postal charges in Washington had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers haunted Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers, defaming Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, a cooperation, trade and shipping agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington web project.
He did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundations of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about 30 places, plus online announcements about two or three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individual ones from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Marja Isomursu, a special researcher at Evira.
They have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, especially the bunnies.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in ostriches.
In 2009 it was really good.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the species’ populations have been in the process of recovery.
There have now been sick green beanie, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, Museum Master at the University of Helsinki’s Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green-peppers will reoccur if nothing is done.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home field advantage over the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led the tournament at the Archerfield Links last year before the final round, but lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of the new location and acts as an ambassador for the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I was following the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field.”
The Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European tour and the European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player living in Southport said.
"I couldn't defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
“Last year’s memories come back to me: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil. He joined the tour earlier this year, turning 50.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Gaming at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played quite well.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio is accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems of the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, at least so far, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori brigade’s communications company, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air surveys will continue.
The investigation began when the man who interrupted his conscript service for health reasons assumed that his health had deteriorated due to the bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lt. Col. Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of the other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that the other members of the unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in detail.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade’s announcement states that due to the arrival of July, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed stubborn because of it, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't cook with a stove.
He also rarely uses the pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, in the troubled province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “nota” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the crust is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Dege’s home; he sits on muddy ground, where he usually does his daily chores, such as laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is served by a bucket in the ceilingless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, and she has not been assigned to manage the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
“No one dares walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which holds firm control of the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and rugged. The journey starts with a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabir, and continues with a tumultuous five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of some 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated ceilings have become yellow-brown with rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei explains. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrap cap, his dark skirt and his brightly colored blouse.
"Before, we only had leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is a highland region about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Just a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
Papua also has an estimated <0x24>78 billion in timber reserves.
But for the Papuans, these riches bring misery, because they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly <0x24>20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, and as much as <0x24>150,000 to individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are being ruthlessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s became genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful protests.
The 2016 We Will Lose Everything report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane reports atrocities such as extrajudicial executions, torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular — and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of casualties because there are cases every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christian, but the demographics are changing as Indonesia’s populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It’s hard for locals to compete.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Pania who moved to the province’s capital for work.
"The local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to address injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to the presidential castle in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You said.
Pania experienced some kind of wave bottom just two months after the inauguration of Jokow in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers disliked the remark, but according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers seized the children and beat them with a rifle tail.
One of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day it started to happen.
About a thousand Papuans —young men and women and children— gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
They carried hunting bows for festive ceremonies, and began performing the traditional Waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in circles and imitated the singing of birds.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed up, the soldiers received the order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen in TIME magazine, which has not been published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident of the Kego Koto area, suspected the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house painted in bright color.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
Several shots were fired in the riot.
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME, sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the death came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that something like this never happens again."
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judiciary.
He immediately began to withdraw his words.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but certain processes are needed to do so,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying that he had no intention of starting investigations in Papua.
“Everything will be resolved in court,” he said.
Wiranto is accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of Paniai’s victims are darkly disbelieving in these allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed at all," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he still lives in fear, even though it’s been years.
“Yes, I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the army, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians do not dare to discuss the event.
He says he was beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot and killed villagers in Paniai’s neighbourhood of Deiya.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at a construction site in front of the company’s office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
Locals say a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing a villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to care.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers who fired the gunshots to be held accountable and for a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the rich central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of Papuans through occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'securing national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is very little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it's too expensive for the locals.
Just like the bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to better-trained and wealthier migrants.
Few people have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The outlying Papua is given little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain stringent.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua after they had been granted a rare photography license, officially due to their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia for Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by lifting restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters reporting from the most troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only from its immediate neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “numerous and widespread violations in Papua”, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia will hold presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know about the situation of the Panians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army, in need and poverty, practically without access to health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like other Papuans, regard the votes they gave to Jokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again demonstrated a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the army station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head inclined.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora: "Even my fans don't want to see me"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to compete at the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora overwhelms Helenius with the reason for the rematch.
My game in Finland flopped, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
“Even his fans don’t want to see him fight because he’s miserable,” Chisora said.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match since then.
The cancellation, however, no longer annoys Chisora.
The match would probably have been cancelled after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up with a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
At the hospital, I was told to have an operation, Chisora said.
The British state is currently in about 45% condition.
He doesn't seem to be interested in a rematch with Helenius, he's aiming for Dillian Whyte.
Chisora defeated Whyte in December.
The Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames captured one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to escape from a 337-meter-high 79-storey building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called the Torch, the torch.
The building was evacuated, and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were sleeping and we woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Service, the firefighters extinguished the fire at 4 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government said it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building’s board of directors commissioned a study that found that the most damaged were the panels used for facade cladding and insulation.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cladding plates at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A motorcycle was stolen from a parking lot during the night.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
It was called the Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.

More than 20% of U.S. air passengers take prohibited items on board, according to a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States, knowingly or unknowingly, carried prohibited articles on board aircraft past TSA checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other sharpened articles that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said they only learned afterwards that they were carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, was answered by more than 1,000 passengers and revealed that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who deliberately violated TSA rules, 19.7 per cent were Generation Y and less than 15 per cent were Generation X.
The most common violation of the rules was to take food and liquids on board the aircraft.
More than 3% admitted that they had deliberately taken items with the blade on board the aircraft, while 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had deliberately taken prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States, and the company wanted to find out how many people had accidentally passed a security check on smuggling goods and how many people had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that those who travel the most are also more likely to pass a security check on smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For some time, it was also thought that books were not allowed on the plane.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Reverses His Decision to Delay Obama's Decisions to Reduce Emissions
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt retracted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions under Obama’s administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads is more responsive to the needs of regional environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start complying with the 2015 soil ozone standard as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of decisions for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan, as the agency “does not want to interfere with local decision-making or interfere with economic growth.”
Pruitt was an Oklahoma state attorney before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to relax the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, obliging them to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his complete reversal of the ozone regulation merely reinforces the EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it, where an agreement on timetables could be reached," Pruitt said.
“We don’t believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use his “authority to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the regulations are “justified and based on the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulation.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA’s state consortium that sued it this week, said the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
“The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York City, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia were also involved.
Ozone is produced when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive groups and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists were delighted with Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure it took for the guy in charge of our breathing to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration, whose ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups.”
Supercar maker is coming up with a SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style," CEO Sergio Marchionne told a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer unveils its new five-year plan.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savo with the same virus type
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, in a person in the coastal Salt Lake has the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles disease detected in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not revealed any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still emerge from the fifth patient until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over yet, says Soster’s infectious disease doctor Mirkaleena Erkkilä.
No new cases of measles infection or suspicion of measles infection have come to light since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for licensed screaming
The potato soup wasn't even considered to be legalized.
The argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to liquor.
Making yelling at home is legal next year, but the legalization of poncho soup is not even considered.
The yelling is made by fermentation, while the pineapples are distilled.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to liquor.
There has been no political will to make poppy soup a every-man right, says Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of poncho was not considered for legalisation.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (ECR).
He is a member of the parliamentary group of government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
A permit for distilling a ponka at home cannot be granted even upon application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen explains that there will be a simple rule in the home cooking of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be cooked at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally yell at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavourings and makes it possible to produce screeches, Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must also be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It should not be put on sale.
This is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session was held at 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a position, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a hospital in South Africa for suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving a prison sentence in Ateridgeville.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning, accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examinations.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medallist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcribed phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Transcripts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public talks about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States denounced Nieto for publicly knocking down the Wall Project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a transcript of Trump’s first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange took place.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement to allow the United States to take in refugees on their way to Australia is “ridiculous,” “poor” and “stupid.” Trump said an agreement negotiated under Obama would make him look like a “idiot” because he had proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump said to Turnbull, “This was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgia massacre: Activists re-incriminate racist lynching for justice
A Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in Monroe, a small town in rural Georgia, and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
A middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man squeals.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-scene, which was performed on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are real when a hanging loop is put on the "Roger" neck.
The Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, to the Moore's Ford Bridge since 2005.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested over these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the rearrangement.
“It is a stain of history, but above all, it is a burden that weighs on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-scening is a startling invitation to action, as well as a reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been rectified.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice, we want things to finally come to an end, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all, we want justice," Brooks said.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim of the massacre in Georgia on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching Monroe and the surrounding counties.
No one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court of Georgia allowed blacks to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court of Georgia passed its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which a black landlord named Roger Malcolm stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcolm's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there were rumors in the city that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcolm <0x24>600 in bail, for which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a vote killing," he said.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-scene of the massacre in Georgia for nearly a decade.
This is an extremely realistic and captivating presentation of a horrific racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared in today's United States.
The show is hard to watch, but even harder not to watch, according to Greene.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," the director said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or if you don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh said.
"But it is important that this aspect of history is also highlighted so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, aka Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcolm screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester's been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?" I said, "Leave my lands, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then the punch goes.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene chuckles.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You'll have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by the spirit of a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who died.
The scene begins again.
Now Rascona's words are striking.
Nobody's laughing.
The remake ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every second word.
A few dozen meters away, some fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half is white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a performance in Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
With Brooks' guidance, they've visited the victims' graves in the pressured humidity of Georgia.
The murders have gone from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing, Greene summons the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children squat around to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers took off their robes and wiped tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforted me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors will gather for a dinner.
The white couple from Altanta are discussing the performance lively with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find the words when she describes the feelings that the performance aroused.
“It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible actions being said and done by people who look just like you – just because they look just like you,” she says.
"I noticed that there were still lynchings," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to the audience sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
"Re-scening is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experience, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
“Its message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who don’t know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Growing vegetables in stores is upsetting: This is how much removing "extra parts" really saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of cauliflower before weighing?
How about removing a big hat from a pineapple - it weighs a lot, doesn't it?
The answers strongly divide opinions: for one, it is a sign of extreme nausea; for others, they do not want to pay for the portions of vegetables that they do not use and that go to the garbage at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, you can find cardboard boxes at the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people rip out the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste.
According to a news report published in the Financial Times, grocery shopping at the vegetable counter amazes merchants.
But how much does removing the excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How important is this really?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take away leaves or strains from pineapple, artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Flower cabbage: The price of a cauliflower, which costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.10, was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.80, when all leaves were peeled out of it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.30, fell to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.95 when its stock turned away.
Latva artichoke: the price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost 75 cents in total.
Without the strains, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain 80 cents.
The result: If you start to pluck leaves and strains, you will save a few dozen centimeters per vegetable at best.
Considered as a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of <0x24>1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona after five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian footballer Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
On Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the buyer cannot pay the buyout price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out the contract himself, which is done by wagering the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of PSG's season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates the details
Barcelona said in a statement that it would provide details of the payment to the European Football Federation (UEFA) so that it could determine any disciplinary action that might result from the incident.
Spanish league leader Javier Tebas has said that PSG’s spending violated UEFA’s financial fair play rules.
The Uefa can penalize a club that makes a loss of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar’s move will not automatically violate its economic norms.
Neymar’s move to PSG will have an impact on the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, UEFA said.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, was severely burned by a lightning strike, the flash was captured in the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was working on a plane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when lightning suddenly struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The force of lightning threw the plane into the ground near the wing of Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that my brother had been electrocuted and that he was in the hospital.
“I’m just asking if he’s alive,” Austin’s sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he suffered muscle damage and cerebral haemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to follow it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revitalizes business by cutting dividends
On Friday, Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it launched a new restructuring plan in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company already cut 4,000 jobs in previous restructurings.
Pearson announced that it will cut costs again by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million in May as part of its third austerity program, which aims to revive businesses that have been weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its turnover grew by 1% in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul’s Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked with a "person-carried explosive device".
The statement said all the injured were in stable condition and were treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, an area mostly populated by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's most devastating attack by a militant group since the U.S.-led overthrow of the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to assist the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions under Obama’s administration the day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone specifications" late Wednesday, according to the agency, as a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone specifications by one year until October 2018. According to the specifications, smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in line with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 states that are predominantly Democrat-controlled, including the District of Columbia, claiming it was illegal to postpone implementation.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama’s time, saying these measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health consequences of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIS had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be transported on July 15, but was interrupted before security checks.
Police do not explain why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device emitting toxic, colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Neste’s CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved good results in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level and the EBIT development in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
Implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the 66.7-pound series, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men stayed in their own rooms at ESPN’s offices in Los Angeles until WBC’s invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, WBO’s top feather champion.
Garcia won the show on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the list of boxers in different weight categories.
Garcia reached out his right hand and asked, "How are you, champ?
Good luck in the game!"
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomashenko’s manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between men would be “perfect in terms of size.”
"I'm a former feather serialist," Garcia recalled.
“I moved up the set [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm a small 63.5-pound.
I want to go back to lightweight.
He has to get into the lightweight series [61,2 kg], then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
Lomasenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be played on a pay-channel. This is part of his strategy for Lomashenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and to fight Garcia (37–0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in September.
"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing his willingness to play on the channel that offers the best reward package.
"We're the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
As soon as we reach an agreement...”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "unbelievable fighter" and that he might be going to watch Saturday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's compliment and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow." Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said he focused first on showing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the match between them to be more and more intense.
“This is the match we are waiting for.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5,300 euros, training whatever happens - the situation in investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The latest news from Helsingin Sanomat was about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment adviser of the banker’s business spoke with complete nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightenings are based on the new MiFID, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements in the law.
The financial sector itself recommends that those working in an investment service take their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of examinations for a company called APV-investment degrees Oy, whose examination team includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and actors in the field.
The exams cover 12-15 ECTS credits and are prepared by Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
On its website, it says that in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material of the degrees consists of 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70 percent.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have either completed the APV1 or APV2 degrees, as they are compulsory under the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller brokerage shops without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are “a few” bankers.
According to Saviko, 13,000 to 14,000 people have completed the APV1 degree since 2000 and approximately 3,000 people have completed the APV2 degrees recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some brokerages consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
Many other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Sector Recommendation requires the completion of APV examinations, because that is when the knowledge related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros a month in commissions, including benefits in kind and performance bonuses.
The average monthly earnings of regular working hours are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,900 per month and women more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500 per month.
The tenth of those who earn the most earns about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100 on average.
One tenth of the men who earn the most earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 a month or more, and one tenth of the women who earn the most earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the level of employees and functions, self-regulation has hitherto been trusted.
According to Fiva, in the course of its audit, there were individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were insufficient based on the advisor’s activities.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if you have a low level of professionalism and competence.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
More other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II.
It requires that each firm is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, in turn, will probably have the authority to determine what needs to be known.
Marko Hovi, the market supervisor at Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is a decree on the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both the own staff of investment firms and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the Government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is likely to have the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel’s job descriptions at an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to Hovi, the requirement to work with someone more experienced on the deadline is also new if the level of competence or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with the person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become tighter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner plane "draws" giant plane over US
The route was drawn over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight took place on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, on which Boeing tested the endurance of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew 15,700 kilometres in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the United States borders throughout the journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s resilient beach schoolchildren are not surprised by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen polski persistently with the help of the bathing village
Iines Kaikkonen proceeded at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra’s beach swimming schools are running in Liettee and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even if it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers aren’t bothered, says Taina Itkonen, head of swimming schools.
A total of 13 children will be able to swim in swimming schools this week, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that school and Eskiäri will start by then, Itkonen estimates.
Imatra’s beach swimming school is organized in cooperation with the Sports Combine project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday there was a nice atmosphere at Liettee beach.
The sun was shining, and the young swimming schoolchildren trained to stay on the surface with the bathing troughs, some even without it.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Five of them first went deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to swing towards the beach.
You're doing great!
She said she went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the sludge beach is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You can also be happy with today’s achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 years old, once again wanted to go to water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 years old, swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has always loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed to the pier.
The boys had enough to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking on fruit and sunbathing.
The lessons continued in the water, but the pier was not in a hurry.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
Unknown Soldier Sells Toilet Brushes - "Here's a Unifying Story"
You see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, which manufactures cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier series a few days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes, laundry racks... and a "toilet brush with a border brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the movie that will premiere in the autumn and the marketing of the movie.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will Unknown-Health Bandages come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Deputy CEO of Blue Product, say?
We are the film’s partner.
We support this film, just like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will be specially presented in stores, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this -- often when you think that products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Soldier Unknown.
Cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other company partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already released by Suomen Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there will be a continuation.
Among the unfamiliar partners, Valio, Retailer, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products, writes Kinnunen.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests announced
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been released. The results of tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were found to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Bureau of Forensic Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has ordered 6,880 tests so far, and the Office of Forensic Medicine has now published the results of 2,481 tests carried out between mid-March and end-July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the Office of Forensic Medicine determined that the test subject was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age stated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson, from the Forensics Office, says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent, and there are no big differences from previous months' figures," he told The Local.
While a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were “signs that the subject was 18 years of age or older.”
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic resonance images of the knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has entered puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensics Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, it can be said that the risk of defining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test subject is about to turn 18 years old, with a risk of about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed by 30 seats in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent his 30th step down on the score bar in the European Tour of Golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left the shared 11th place on Saturday, but was found sharing 41th place at the end of the round.
In the difficult weather, Ilose accumulated one double bog to accompany three bogs.
The others had trouble too.
Englishman Ian Poulter took the top spot in a less-par lap, although he said there was enough work in the umbrella.
The weather was rough, but I was hanging with it and in the end the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodd.
West Virginia Governor Changes Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday that he would change party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
“Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.”
The audience burst into loud applause.
"Tomorrow I will register as a member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owned coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about <0x24>1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday night stating that “Governor Justice’s party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to build barriers rather than a better America.”
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS.
Lightning sowed damage - Thursday will become even the summer's harshest thunderstorm day
There will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland in the end of the week.
Over the past week, there have been thunderstorms, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the South-West region of Finland.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes set off several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the worst thunderstorm day of the summer.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, lightning has struck especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
At the table, lightning struck the rowhouse's power station, causing a small fire.
The fire was reported to the rescue department about half past midnight on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department demolished the roof and wall to find the fireplaces and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
At Loimala, lightning set fire to the outer building in Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue services arrived, the building was already in a full fire phase, and the rescue services had no choice but to prevent the spread of the fire.
A fifty-square-meter building burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä, near Kuopio, another lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
Rescue services came to the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses burned.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The fault was reported on Thursday morning between 8:00 and 9:00, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was solved just before 5 p.m.
Since then, the train service has been able to continue normally on the thunderstormed section of the line.
Lightning has scattered devastation all over Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely sad! says meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, on-call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, it also feels strong to many.
This might seem like a really hard thunder, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s thunderstorms,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the ground lightning flashed 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential even for the strongest thunderstorm day of the summer: by about 4 p.m. there were 1,790 ground lightning flashes on the board.
If the lightning still continues in the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking thunderstorm year was 2015, when the annual lightning volume was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightnings this year had risen to 18,386.
It is important that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovis, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a suitable birth environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms will move from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where you can get about 2,000 lightning days on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform rainfall is expected in the central parts of the country.
In such a case, the thunderstorms are rarely thundered.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology for doping scandal
World athletics leader Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to lift Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shlyahtin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Cup that Russia’s ban is appropriate and that he will fight doping with determination.
He said he felt sorry for “all the athletes who were taken away with gold or silver medals in the competitions.”
Despite his remarks, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of extending the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendation of the working group that this is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system."
Nineteen Russian athletes compete for the status of neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"Tests are still inadequate, and the trainers who are banned are still operating freely," he told reporters Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappoints with Tom of Finland's film's poor success
The Tom of Finland movie did not become as successful as the filmmakers hoped, says Yle.
Honestly speaking, I am disappointed, admits the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film’s budget of about five million euros.
This is not a lottery win, but it’s important that investors get their money back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the Financial Rules of Football Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
Neymar's move from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, is the most expensive transfer ever made by European football clubs.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the Fair Play Financial Rules, which require PSG to be able to prove that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to terminate the Brazilian deal, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new club will move in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG will have no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer and joining his starguard, as it will be financed by Qatar's oil-enriched dynasty.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they need to be offset by real sources of income to avoid losses in football-related business.
The Fair Play Financial Rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, the French president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their backs.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model that Roman Abramovich used for the first time at Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge amounts of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of the Fair Play Financial Rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA Chairman in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the club’s reckless spending.
"The fair play rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play financial rules at UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of his contract on a lump sum, it can amortize the amount for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million over the next five years.
The first sanctions were imposed on the basis of the financial rules of fair play in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and the Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit its team to 21 players in the Champions League for the 2014–15 season, instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the support is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not count the support as actual revenue.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that support for PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was oversized.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be financed by contributions from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar is being made a World Cup ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to expose such an arrangement.
Due to PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA is monitoring attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely than usual.
Sources informed on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity was not disclosed because they had no authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to PSG's most recent published financial statements, PSG's net sales in 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and its operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and shirts.
The company expects to increase its net sales by at least 30% with the Neymar deal.
The Spanish league, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world’s best players, tried to hamper Neymar’s move, allegedly in breach of the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case, both for the club and for the state," Spanish League president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports magnate.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football operating environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said.
“Everything is possible once the state owns the football team.
Compliance with the financial rules of fair play will be very difficult. There are so many interests associated with the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Now is a hurry: Coach of Finnish World Championship athletes jammed in Helsinki
Length jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the World Championships in athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the distance jump qualification tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
Armenian coach Ghazaryan has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in the British embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a documentary, but it has not been accepted for a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, said coach Jorma Kemppainen.
In the past, he has always handled the visas himself successfully, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It's not that important.
As long as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the possible absence.
World Cup medal in London demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics start in London on Friday and last a week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the kinds of sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value race to another, where experience matures the athlete’s performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Nowadays, there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, and there are no such young athletes.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising thing about sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the races, even though the London medals are not resolved until late at night due to the time difference.
At the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Long Hill.
The daredevils are waiting for the medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the other one is told by the recent results of him and other throwers, as well as the failure of Pitkämäki to qualify in last summer’s medal competitions.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the competitions, entering the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be given by a good success in international youth medal competitions this summer as well.
Raising young talents and financially supporting their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come instantly, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaches and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terror deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Eenni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm really upset"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air world cup.
The women's championship was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the races, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and feels good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite.
I will try it again in the races from now on, think about Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new speedboat stranded in port in Helsinki
The new cruise ship FSTR from the shipping company Viking is seriously delayed.
The express ship was to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loading at 8 o’clock.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've been waiting for at least an hour and a half to get on board.
Now the queue is moving a bit, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian who is waiting to board the ship in the port of Helsinki at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane suspected that the new ship had a technical failure.
Rebane said the shipowner had brought bottles of water to those waiting in their cars to board the ship.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund told IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn’s return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on 6th Street on Thursday night
The 42-metre-long special transport runs from Muukko to Mustola harbour during Thursday evening.
Transportation departing at 9:00 should be arriving by 11:00 p.m.
The police are directing traffic on the Sixth Road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transportation from Mälkiä continues along road 13 to Mustola harbour.
Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story craves both the glorious days of the 80’s and the grunge of the 90’s (then David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing the brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and his own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant remembrance in which we have stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to be outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (this included the background story of a can of vegetables speaking with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional and its parody is more fragmented: it parodyes stalkker movies from the '90s, such as the horror film The hand that rocks the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs out the Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn’t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) and his accomplice George H. W. Bush (aptly portrayed by Michael Ian Black) are involved in a crazy plot.
As always in such series, the best are side paths.
It’s especially fun to see Paul Rudd, who has a razor under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the movie Singles. Rudd’s role as Andy, the king of the camp, is already beginning to be an old man.
Moments of random madness may take this series off as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it reaches its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go on the premiere of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of the Americans series, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series wrestling, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the series is a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, in which a couple of cops from Bucharest fight for truth, atheism, and Marxism-Leninism.
The film stars Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who have dubbed Channing Tatum (main producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But much more it is not.
The series has some good visual jokes (the police spend time watching chess on television in the same way that Americans watch football).
With a group of famous voice actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny, you get a fun game to spot.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama – including a killer behind a Reagan mask, for example – so the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long and the series’ humor is neither fast nor abundant.
To summarize, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef visit the U.S. Embassy repeatedly and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make everything a consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and theirs as well.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola takes to the ring in Macau on Saturday - a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game going.
Toni Tauru faces a hard bone in Macau after Brazilian Leandro Issa fought for the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt and a world championship.
For once, I'm fighting my parents.
It's a funny story, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
Kouvolainen was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were made on a fast-track schedule in the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Taurus has never faced anything like this before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It was annoying because training and training took a lot of time.
The fighter, however, is pleased that a new time has been set for the fight.
Waiting for a week doesn’t have much to do with preparation.
The transplant does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
In his last few battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in standing up.
This time the situation is different.
Issa from Kouvolainen describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he's gonna hit hard in the first round and try to take me to the rug.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last game in Kouvola didn’t go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru in the eyebrow, and the win was left to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially upright: he didn't get a single hit.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise to the ring more frequently.
For example, the upcoming opponent Issa fought for the last time in September.
The team had three matches last year.
This is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace gets pregnant.
I have been training in the last few years and I have been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the fight.
When the 32-year-old heard of the upcoming encounter, she decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the pleasure of doing it back.
We had a really good training with a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvolainen will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and to practice upright.
Standing up is the main tactic of the 32-year-old.
You have to hit me sensibly.
If there's a chance, I'll take it to the property myself.
You can't give down exports for free, because they're the ones that consume the most.
Macau is attracted to Tauru, which has previously fought in China.
They say it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there will be a big and beautiful night ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been depressed and inflation easing has stopped speculation about interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, and has postponed interest rates because of increased pressure on families’ income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided by 6-2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25%. This month, the rise in interest rates received even less support due to weak economic growth.
In its quarterly review of inflation, the Bank lowered its growth forecast to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and to 1.6 per cent in 2018. It also warned that household income levels would be under further pressure as inflation is expected to continue to rise to close to 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and the bank said that loan costs could have to increase more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more in favourable financing to banks through the scheme, i.e. a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The minutes of the Bank’s decision on interest rates state: “According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Committee, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the decline in households’ real income reduces consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that to curb inflation, "some tightening of monetary policy" is needed "a little wider than market expectations".
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
In May, the Bank projected 1.9% growth for this year and 1.7% growth for next year.
It now kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Against the dollar, the pound depreciated by 0.5% to USD 1.31, while against the euro it depreciated by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after weaker than expected growth rates dampened increased expectations of interest rate increases. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank says that the situation will worsen before it improves.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income declines in the coming years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the shocking result of the EU referendum, which pushed the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to be reflected in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the central bank, demands for interest rate increases had started to grow as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overrun of its 2% target was due to the "whole" weak pound.
"Given the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying as lenders are feverishly looking for customers and want to close the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan contracts are about to expire. Revolving contracts are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial anti-HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "turn-in" preventive drug for HIV. A dispute over the financing of the drug by the English public health system (NHS) was closed in the Supreme Court.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-relationship medication has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court judgment last year, stating that the NHS was able to pay for the PrEP drug, even though it claimed that it should be financed by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, called the decision a "significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept enrolments for the experiment, which will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medication taken before sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high-risk groups.
The medicine taken before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants for the trial from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partners are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general practitioner care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the NHS in England signed a procurement contract this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by accumulating extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV,” says Stevens.
“It’s another remarkable achievement in over 30 years of struggle to solve one of humanity’s biggest health challenges.”
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is correctly targeted at those in need and at risk, it can have a turning point in the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, people at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, which they will be able to independently decide on without the need to consult with their partner, with an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a large number of people.
This was welcome news.”
“Now the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out,” said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The trial PrEP drug has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection.”
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was delayed for several months in vain due to the government's slowdown," said Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a turning point in our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and take another step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: an interlayer and smart interior solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a Queen Anna-style house. The success of the renovation is attested by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her clothes and moved.
"I used to live in a much bigger apartment with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete deformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the height of the room.
“I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill, where he was commissioned to take advantage of the space of nearly four meters high rooms to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale destination but also a home.
The room height was not enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
“Steel structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be arranged so that there was no need to squat in them.
The structures had to be adjusted so that the height would be just right above and below them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, the Retrouvius copper grid window opens to the elegant living area.
Mirror-sided furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille’s vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look longer than it really is.
The mirror between the kitchen is like a window that opens to another room.
The mirrored furnishings at the entrance provide storage space for Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
This makes it easier to hide the kitchen when it is not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily when lifted in place."
With the rational use of space and storage design, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
“When you sell a property, the area matters – or the valuation of the property,” says Erfan.
"Basically, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The tenant is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is formed partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one is attached to the electrical wiring in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and extra squares can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the house.
Pregnant Princess Sofia in her summer look
Princess Sophia's house is in the middle of nowhere.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sophia was smiling at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow in a gorgeous blue body-length outfit that was perfect for a pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This will be the last representation event where Sofia will represent before her birth.
His scheduled date is September.
For the event dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dressed like a princess.
This week, Sofia has been in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden.
Sophia filled her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sophia even talked to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," Sofia said laughing and pointing to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared on Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
They didn’t dare to taste it, they walked past it.
In the home, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, Panja among the acquaintances.
He didn’t know much Finnish, and the Finns didn’t know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lahti people to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
"Take a taste," he said.
I got hooked in the valley.
I went there more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened her Thai restaurant in Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you’re hungry and places are limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between you and the guest.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Eventually, I sat down at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
It took two years on the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to change because I heard that the spice pastes I made smelled too much in the hall.
A new seat was vacated at the end of the Market Hall.
There's room.
Now we can sit at our own tables again, only in the busiest times do we shyly ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows her clients.
They tell him where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what each person eats.
He has seen how the life stages of the customers change and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me skinny and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit down in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange my thoughts with Panja, who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened up our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On top of restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the fulfillment of two decades.
We got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any fuss or attention, this remarkable day went on in front of work.
Discovery of an Underground Base Reveals 173 ISIS Terrorists Ready to Attack in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list of important anti-terrorist work.
The list contains the data of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each of them.
Of the people on the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains has been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' identities and photos while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials evaluated the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was fear that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s home country.
The list also specifies the specialties of terrorists.
Sami J., a 27-year-old German, is listed as Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
Next to his photo, a suicide bomber is written as a specialty.
There is no clearer information about the man’s fate.
In total, about 6,000 fighters have left Europe for ISIS, the fate of which is uncertain.
Man sunk under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
The fire chief of the Helsinki Rescue Department, Ville Estlander, said the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the report.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, according to Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after 4:30 p.m.
The person was delivered to primary care.
Lander said it was a 50-year-old man.

Brothers fight for over <0x24>500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are arguing about one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires, worth over <0x24>500 million, in connection with a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former chairman of Carlton Football Club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak value zone just three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began accumulating wealth when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established Westco Jeans, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to a contract with the family's deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to the court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns property worth about <0x24>316 million and Paul owns property worth about <0x24>176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal to himself," Paul wrote in his first sworn statement to the court in 2015.
The case was first heard by the Supreme Court on Friday after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of the business.
Colin says the allegation isn't true, and he's accusing Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
In one of his first sworn statements, Colin writes that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and gourmet shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought the property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons harmoniously.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to go to court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business. According to Colin, Mark received <0x24>10 million and Luke <0x24>26 million when they left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “broken about the financial terms of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who replied, saying in a text message that you can't really comment on the matter because it's going to go to court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag my family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight this way," Colin continued, saying that he still hopes that a solution will be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to fade away.
"Our case will be resolved in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's use of media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
The first.
According to Poltico, the White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s use of the media and follow-up to the news so that the boss doesn’t get into trouble as often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he mentioned a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through him, because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have also tried to limit Trump’s use of the media and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was upset by unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled matters more fairly," Trump's campaign advisor, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico’s reporter Tara Palmeri wrote that “six former campaign workers said it is essential to control Trump’s use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise.”
Yes, sir.
But it’s ridiculous to claim that Trump’s use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If at least a few times his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing an uproar.
Part of the problem is that there are rival factions in the White House who are trying to advance their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately gave the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can get furious about the newspaper clippings that criticise him – especially if they say that there are harmful data leaks – so he has to know where the data came from.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone maliciously handed the president a copy of the GotNews.com news site, founded by the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Assistant Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun to question staff about Walsh after reading the story.”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “had tried to implement a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pushing their own affairs.
These immutable facts make Kelly’s task extremely difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian footballer Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
On Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was terminated and he was free to move to PSG.
The transfer amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I am in good shape"
From the TV series Time of the Rose and Pure White Blankets, the bestselling author Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
The five grandchildren hold the grandmother so much in their grasp that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and the apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but this spring the rented apartment also left.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which she has survived.
The outer appearance is also 20 kilos lighter.
Weight began to drop when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were antidepressants.
I was helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
“Alcohol takes you away,” the brilliant writer openly says.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have traveled the same path for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was about getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, quitting her life that way, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who has made an extensive career as a writer, remembers only well the 44-part TV series Clean White Sheets, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
When I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on an airplane, I finally decided to start the clothing industry.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I acted as a mannequin,” Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed this, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many scripts in the works - ideas for hundreds.
Cyclists return to "millionaire's alley"
One of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands is once again on the grid with stubborn travelers who managed to cross the ditch that was needed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
Twenty people parked their caravans near a street called the Millionaires’ Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a ditch that the municipality needed as a barrier, bringing children, horses and an army of vans.
The tourists managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Infuriated residents have accused Solihull’s municipality of “complete inability to solve the problem.”
The anonymous resident said the travelers had arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
“A municipality needs to be tough on how to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably more of them today.”
The resident said the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by refusing access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the travelers returned so soon after they were expelled.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even dropped them in a park grazed by a horse."
A spokesman for Solihull Municipality said the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It will help to form a complete picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry people encircled the Portuguese plane
The men who landed on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the crash, two people died yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with homicide.
The maximum sentence in Portugal is 16 years in prison.
A small aircraft flew by men was forced to land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical failure.
At the time of the incident, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran into the water to escape the landing plane.
The plane crashed into a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane hit the man on the back of the plane.
Immediately afterwards, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, Filipe Janeira told the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl’s parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started to beat the tail, said Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident in the journal Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star who lost her leg tragically won the World Cup gold again: “Without accident, I wouldn’t be a world champion”
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the World Gold Championship in a banked slalom at Big White in Canada early on Wednesday morning.
In the past, Suur-Hamari also won the cross world gold.
All in all, there are already three MM titles.
Awesome World Cup!
Two times we were treated for gold, we were pulled with a pretty good heartbeat, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, was happy.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is constantly increasing.
The whole parasnowboarding has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new riders involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse behind you.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been zealously descending from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to get on the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without it.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in joking.
The cards that are dealt are played with, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Grand Hamari does not.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say it turned into a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest skateboarding rush was already fading.
The work towards the top did not really start until after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with friends, and we were always thrilled to touch the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in the X-Games startup.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought it would be a very long life if I stayed here and felt bitter and sorry.
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with Leo-Pekka Tähti’s selection as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion was awarded at the sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the Star’s victory is an important signal to parasports.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open your eyes to the para-sports world.
When is it time to launch the Athlete of the Year campaign of the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see about that in due course.
I try my best to succeed.
So far, Great Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he craved.
Next year we have a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
“The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to be able to return to their home countries.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of young Arabs for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
More than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently to their home countries in the future.
42 per cent of the respondents may think they are returning to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in permanent repatriation, while a quarter believe that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Less than one-tenth of Syria’s decision-makers consider improvements in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the most important factors.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
Al-Assad’s presidency is a barrier to a peace deal.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a good quarter believes in solving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugees see ISIS’s power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feels its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to convey information to people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people preferred military measures and education reform.
A good tenth believes that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the conflict in Syria, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four believes the conflict in Syria will worsen during Trump’s term.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web organized – his database is used by people like Wikipedia and Google.
MariaDB develops the “world’s fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data remain organized and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use MariaDB or MySQL databases.
"All information that is not in image format comes from a database, and even the images are linked there," Widenius explains.
Widenius, Chief Technology Officer at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful places makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with David Axmark from Sweden.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for <0x24>1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured Sun for <0x24>7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't make a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn’t want his life’s work to die.
I hired 20 of the best developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
We just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to oversee MariaDB’s code development freedom.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius regrets.
While many people have heard about Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trading, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Our growth rate over the past few years has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, Chief Financial Officer at MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a bit short on the company’s key figures.
MariaDB expects to receive orders worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also assists in the exchange of databases, which can be over a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they are versions of each other.
Among others, Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux OS distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest gamblers.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks," Paqvalé said.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although, according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, gamblers like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit rapidly growing.
In a <0x24>50 billion database market, open source databases don’t even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in terms of money, since most users do not pay anything for this software.
Research company Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will be developing more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open ones at the time, or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies won’t get new customers because most of them choose open source.
This has resulted in commercial database licensing fees jumping to the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as they did with fewer customers,” Widenius says.
Because the exchange of a closed database is cumbersome, most of the customer companies have absorbed price increases in obedience.
"There are a lot of customers who find it really difficult to switch because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer’s measure is coming to full.
With licensing fees rising every year, the customer will sooner or later switch to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are already facing major system changes as they migrate their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the influence of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed at how in Finland money is wasted on closed health care systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things it can’t invent or can’t do.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters, along with another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on the basis of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy tightens its stance on NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that are rescuing refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit themselves to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.
Mr Minnit's warning came one day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the German ship of the Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with smugglers, which contributed to illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges brought by prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who were able to re-use the boats.
One of these allegedly occurred just a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, according to a document of the prosecutor, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
On Thursday, he declared that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not cause “significant changes or obstacles” to the organization’s rescue efforts.
Among those who refused to abide by the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders.
Mr Minniti, for his part, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of the rescue efforts had fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considered to be evidence that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors were beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that it is planned to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing cohabiting partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor
The suspected crime took place last December in Enontekiön Kuttas.
A Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has been said that they were both seasonal workers.
Police said the suspect had fled with two dogs after the attack.
The man was found cold in the ground, and he did not resist being captured.
The case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be discussed in the Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy from Harry Potter and Friends with All Hair has passed away
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's family announced his death on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also appeared in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the James Herriot book-based television series Friends with All Hair.
The BBC’s popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and phone calls allegedly instigating her boyfriend Conrad Roy’s suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, serves 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
In June, Carter was convicted of murder and her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at the hearing on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be dealt with on leave of absence.
He was threatened with 20 years in prison, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Wearing red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed, with a weeping gaze on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He did not take responsibility for the crime,” the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter’s lawyer said the incident was due to “shockful circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said Carter's "age or maturity, or even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, a statement in which she said, "There's not a day that goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I can cope with all this, and I will try my best to comfort his sisters in the pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was "persecuted" by the thought that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never stops," Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The incident aroused national attention when it was revealed that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in a text message.
"Watch yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy’s suicide, Carter wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “You just have to turn on the generator, and you’re free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox opinion paper in which he said, “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia are the worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
"I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, President Donald Trump was able to say that the relationship between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on Congress to thank the poor relations between the two countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a setback for car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW offered to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW CEO said the company believes that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been heavily marketed by European car manufacturers in order to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions neutralising devices is increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being sympathetic to the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in the cars, which reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi engine development department, thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and can be extradited to the United States for trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions standards. The allegation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer in Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuelan Vote Begins Fraudulent Investigation, Big Protests Promise
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion about a company that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, president of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro wants the crisis to end
In a controversial vote on Sunday, a representative assembly was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Pais newspaper, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night at local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the Lavender of Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is directly endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked reduction in spring and autumn rainfall," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the life of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cockroaches to the area, which spread microbes."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of long thorns and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened, or missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with a protective clay-water mixture, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist is a growing threat in Mexico.
The editorial of the once-weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the newspaper deals with the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in Sinaloa State.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists are urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: to leave the children at home or to take them with them to a delivery that was the subject of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are enough.
The name of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who are suspected of being on the payrolls of the government or drug cartels —criminals who make the news of the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
At least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists (CCP). 589 journalists have been attacked and threatened under federal protection. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture, in which Valdez shows his middle finger. On the photo reads: "Justice". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have worn T-shirts, adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and has become a trademark
The meeting takes place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists discuss their collective trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
A federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 specifically to deal with journalists' cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely prosecuted, as are the thousands of murders per year involving drug trafficking and organised crime.
Riodoce's reporters are planning to continue writing about Sinaloa's violence, even though they are grieved and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use, as the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
“Frankly, this meeting is a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause.”
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had only driven a few blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was grieved by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors are circulating quickly and freely in Culiacan.
The death of Valdez is still in silence.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and in the cemetery there are decorative two-storey cemeteries of drug barons that are larger than the homes of many.
In a coastal state, it is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival faction that is at war with Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s sons could be upset: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish Riodoce with five colleagues. The magazine's shares were then sold for <0x24>50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the journal that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his reportage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Prize by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when receiving the journalists' protection committee award.
Drug trafficking is a “lifestyle” in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The editor must accept the task that falls upon him – or play the fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was being sown here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce’s staff misses Valdez – a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine was his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to think about how best to do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez said.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, a Riodoce reporter, said: "Impressions can be deceiving, and so was Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
A few days earlier, it had become clear that only government-sold spyware had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter from 40 degrees Celsius under the shade of a tree.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half-joking as to whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not believe to be reliable.
It had been months since reporters had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial scheduled three main cases.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s spending was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, a group of people had been kidnapped in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official information about who had been abducted and how, so it was necessary to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicised cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, one of which was the son of "El Chapo" Guzman, who managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would have provided reliable information about the abduction.
"We would have known earlier what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our sources are cut off."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against journalists' persecution are stored, and the journalists have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become freedom of the press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left the morning before the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration in response to another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, according to official DNA tests, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly across the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on the sidewalks and buildings during the protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support to investigate the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in his anger.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, the authoritative authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by the police and the authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
The Zetas cartel signed a note on his body saying, "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his cut-out head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, including Nuevo Laredo El Manana, despite the fact that its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted on its front page a message to drug cartels: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra —who was once supposed to be a poet— admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, the reporters of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the delivery at midnight on Friday, after the latest issue of the magazine had been completed.
A shooting between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort killed 19 people.
The war intensified, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be rebuilt the next day.
Sirens howling nearby – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The edition of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait of a man showing his middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says you can't even consider shutting down the business. "How can I shut down the magazine when our intern asked me to go out on the street and do the story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Tough place"
In April, the celebration of the 39-year-old Hannu Manninen was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen became ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May was almost over when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a pediatric disease such as ear infection, in which I had to eat a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn’t make the most of my training enthusiasm,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomi.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was not allowed to train until the second week of June, which was shown in the roller mat test carried out on 12 June by the KIHU Research Centre for Competition and Higher Sports.
In the test, the athlete skis on roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It’s a wall, Manny says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen said he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period.
We also had a week and a half off from flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race, when Manninen reached the top 18th place with top skiing.
Guidelines withdrawn
Manninen and head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to last season.
After the first snow races, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, we would like to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, it is still planned to be in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Mannis' sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City the 2002 gold medal team competition celebrated the moor underline.
Dinosaur protects itself from enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first results of a study of a creature the size of a rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner, which was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had a "problematic past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the world’s best of its species.
The newly discovered fossil is the nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this surprisingly well-preserved fossil a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out from 1,100 kilos of boulder.
The results of hard work can now be seen.
"If you flip your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were probably a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it was armored and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged its predators, and it was also protected by a darker coloration on the top and lighter on the bottom, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now exhibited at Tyrrell’s Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by the coloration, which is common in the animal world, with the body darker on the outside and lighter on the outside.
The observation was still surprising, because the Borealope is considerably larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be inferred from this that it was preyed upon by meat-eating dinosaurs to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Today’s animals, such as deer, zebras, and armadillos, have similar colorings and are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales of the nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back into the seabed.
Alberta was then as warm as it is now in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in its original three-dimensional form," Brown said.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous.
It does not require much imagination to comprehend it: if you blink your eyes a little, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.”
The Cretaceous era was the era of the theropods, the huge bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before the Borealopetta, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with skin and armor from the muzzle to the hip.
Nodosaurs were an average of five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-metre-long spikes rose from their platforms.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved to the smallest detail in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its leather remains in the pitted plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more closely you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull lining still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also count the scales on the sole of his feet.”
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his classmate:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were numerous retweets on his timeline from <0x40>TheePharoah.
The name belongs to a St. Louis rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user also posted a picture of Brown's dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, he was told that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police lock-ups and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who carried a sign that said, “The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell watched a live video of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he had seen a video of another policeman arming his rifle and shouting, “I’ll kill all of you...animals.”
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder that we’re used to and that you could call typical.
That's when I felt cold.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a flight home the next day.
When the plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, Ferrell picked up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been documented in Whose Streets?, which premiered in theaters on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went out into the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, they had another conversation about "what it's like to be black and under what conditions," and they had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it’s not right.”
"I couldn't stop taking my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we need to do to be freed, to liberate ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt her if I protected her from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that the police would not be prosecuted.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to adopt a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any experience with organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “would simply tell you what was going on.”
Ferrell had a suspicion, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was rooted in the countless times that people, usually whites, appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a common voice," Folayan said in an interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among death row prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals, and the film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a documentary in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis said.
"The most important thing for me was how the local people are represented in the film, because I am represented in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not the intention to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about a community".
That’s why the documentary reveals surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when she tells me what it was like to see the movie for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the humane description of blacks require a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story re-evaluates and re-evaluates the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (<0x23>BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with a queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has sustained the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed sustained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrelli was not chosen for the documentary "self-intended" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that she was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have been leaving Ferguson for a long time, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell still has two-and-a-half years left on parole, and he was convicted of blocking the highway during a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere in his hometown is brief and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still relies on a slogan he learned from the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning’s DNA
At the Fridman Gallery in New York, faces —white, black, and brown— are hung in the middle of the exhibition space, and one can see the resemblance between them if one looks at them more closely.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s cheek and hair.
Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on August 2, 2017.
Two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was relieved by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. These are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the editability, ambiguity and causality of DNA data, as well as on the identity behind the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has been identifying with women since puberty, and was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a granular black-and-white selfie where Manning, who feels uncomfortable, sits in the driver’s seat in the car, wearing a platinum-wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was backed by the highly popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, with DNA data from cigarette butts and gums, and images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told the news conference.
He couldn't visit Manning and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became friends in correspondence, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which portrayed a future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and she would be allowed to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a military prison in Kansas.
It’s also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump wages his own war against data leaks and transgender soldiers, and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist, and under it is Manning’s large autograph, with the heart at the point of the last name (i). In his statement, the artist demands an end to “the automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based”.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the artist’s scientific definition implies – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least in our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretations,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of them are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning’s character emerges from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can silence you, they've won," the picture reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold freaks."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning comes to the show, he is greeted with a face based on his own genetic knowledge, like a group of demonstrators in the middle of the showroom.
It is deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Suspected of Murder
Police said they had launched a nationwide search to locate a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Cook County court records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts on her body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has been working as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In an email, Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of social affairs at the university, said Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the U.S. authorities investigating the case in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
The Chicago Police Department’s chief of information, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we're constantly refining our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He said the police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague indication that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been inside the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of the events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and “kill Muslims” in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," he told the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and “kill all Muslims.”
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment.
Police said they were alerted by the bookstore staff on May 23.
According to officials, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police for threats.
The threat was not related to the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, a police spokesman said.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police.
As a punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>690) in legal costs and <0xC2><0xA3>85 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>95) in compensation to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said several hate crimes were not reported.
“We will take action in accordance with the WADA roadmap to be completed in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the work of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Roadmap to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the roadmap measures have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in these areas," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the re-establishment of RUSADA's mandate, and the second part of the road map was recently published on the WADA website.
It says it contains nothing of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the elements of the roadmap requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the results of a study ordered by the WADA, conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, investigating the alleged state involvement in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit what did not exist."
The statement echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, president of Russia’s independent public anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian sports media RSport earlier that day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping agencies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We will not approve the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping controls in Russia in November 2015, after the scale of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July, after which he stated that the organisation was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation loved by Finns: “There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packaging”
The British Association doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian say the Lullaby Trust bans the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in the UK.
Distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity package reduces the risk of sudden death.
Sudden death is the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust works as an expert on safe sleep for children in the UK.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them as it would imply that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is due to many reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that each family is given a box there may be one factor.
But you can’t say for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
Maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package includes various accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packing can be the best place to sleep if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends that you use the package only for daytime sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and making sure they don’t get wet or dirty.
A swift villain escapes from a Japanese zoo for the second time
A Japanese zoo staff is looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the crew with speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won’t die instantly because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is a female, weighing 55 kilos, and is about a meter tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During open hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of a turtle.
The last runaway of the villain happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
“I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help,” Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we can ever imagine.
These Startups Help Your Business Avoid Uber’s Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective," says Errett. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have come to the market to help other companies find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, enquire and target specific teams and population groups, and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct access to senior management by-passing the board of directors.
"You can track your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years and says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program allows you to make quick queries and votes for specific teams. In addition, it allows you to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have the lowest ratings. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have realised that they need to follow a workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that, according to Let’s Talk Payments, could reach more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent improper behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed a contract with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to conduct tailor-made surveys, collect responses in confidence in real-time, and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if the manager has reason to suspect inappropriateness, the complaints go directly to the company’s board of directors.
"Public opinion has superseded authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He pointed out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
With more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect to the headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to first figure out the phone number or email address they were able to report to the headquarters, then they had to file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, General Counsel at Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I am gaining a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of employee reality,” says Vitrano, who leads the risk management team at Ruby Tuesday.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement even more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with the use of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists, and both Glint and Convercent have venture capitalists to support them.
In February, Convercent raised <0x24>10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of <0x24>47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of <0x24>60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and they give their time to a truly beneficial business.
"Employees become more committed to the success of a company if they feel comfortable and listened to and rewarded for their work," said Nina McQueen, Executive Vice President, Employee Reward and Well-being at LinkedIn.
Investors get a return when companies are successful, and companies are successful when employees are engaged.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken against it.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if the change doesn’t come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,” says Russell Raath, CEO of the management consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on mere gathering of information.
"If the company fails to take action, employees will start to wonder if they were consulted.
Whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts monthly personnel surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of its employees in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there is no business.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of ciphering his naked female neighbor, reports TT news agency.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of her window.
The woman said the cell phone's camera was filming the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the incident had run to the other room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon afterwards lowered to the window again.
The 20-year-old suspect admitted to photographing the woman.
He said he only photographed a woman’s face.
The video was removed and the police were unable to return it as evidence.
During the interrogation, the man admitted to the crime but denied committing the crime.
The man in the photo was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor "quite insanely."
According to the news agency TT, the man will be prosecuted.
Teachers demand more cash in autumn negotiations
Wage growth cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of OAJ, said on Thursday.
Temporary cuts in public sector holiday allowances highlight the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility of concluding agreements that do not in any way include holiday money cuts.
In the municipality sector, contracts should only be concluded once private sector papers have been signed and the percentage increases are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, the working conditions of OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage target has not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, the public sector professional negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, the statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, temporary holiday allowance cuts will further exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be determined.
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the worst performers are increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and the differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins Players Day Extended as NCAA Reduced Daily Exercises From Two to One
It's almost 11 p.m., and a group of UCLA American football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus's new training ground.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs are shining from the sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this conversation for a few minutes is a noon break.
After three hours of rehearsals, students return to the dorm to read their final exams. The next morning, they meet at 7:30 at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's transition to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of university sports reduced the number of daily rehearsals from two to one. The purpose of the change was to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started after 7:15 p.m., and it was hard to find space on the players' already full schedules.
This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coaching season of Mora 6 that the trainings are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The rehearsals are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparations for the season's opening match begin: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made players’ schedules even tighter.
“We’re going to put a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great guys.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp, which is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs flying over the safety net behind the goal pole.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora said.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is quite expensive.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
On Friday, a presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda, with a clear winner.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for a third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics.
Kagame is running for a third term because the Constitution, which limited the two terms of the presidency, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a well-respected leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in unifying the country divided by the genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the country has been reclaimed.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact checks
Facebook plans to increasingly send fake news to independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article, which was announced by the world’s largest social network on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the largest fake news distributors, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The subject has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election, and Germany, preparing for the September election, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
In a separate statement published in Germany on Thursday, Facebook announced that fact-checking will be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t pass the screen of independent auditors. They also want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook’s news feed, wrote in the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Origin of the Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for its Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
With 700 years of turbulent history behind it, this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is now the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppy-haired writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to look at a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
The Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which was inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was in tears when I noticed a thumbprint in a letter written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
It was his fingerprints.
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives!”
With the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council for the Arts of England, the writer, who was attracted to the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities such as hyena heads hanging on the walls, and bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries.
He toured the ruins and lands of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he “takes a whiskey and starts writing.”
The closest history of Scotney is fairly unknown, as the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about a decade later, the Foundation’s staff was just beginning to review the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the surpluses to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine land disputes being boring," Rhodes says. "However, here families even fought for one birch.
I thought we should let it go now.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It tells the story of a man who, shortly after the completion of the castle, joins the English peasant revolt in 1381.
"The book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
"The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the revolt could begin with a riot.
“Maybe these events are related?”
Other stories in the book are closely related to the castle’s history—such as The Priest, the story of a priest that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (which was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite a crook, they were constantly in debt and they were buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to flatter heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Eläänmäki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, from which only a eutrophicated plot remains.
The castle of Scotney has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to that damn thing.”
Russia is the worst since the Cold War.
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
"I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, President Donald Trump was able to say that the relationship between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on Congress to thank the poor relations between the two countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko quits his rematch against Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitschko, the long-time heavyweight world champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Ukraine's Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Klitschko won 64 of the 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match by knockout in the 11th set.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
Klitschko found no motivation for the match.
"I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klichko’s justification for his decision in the video.
Klitschko’s manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to stop was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he doesn’t have enough motivation anymore.
This is the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one daughter, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko’s older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different federations at the same time.
Finnish weather traveller witches out the conditions: "Export from the mood"
Stab jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor railway season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman out of her mood.
The conditions at the London World Cup are unstable.
Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the race, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn’t get even the small stakes to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced a breeze like this in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the practice," Nikkanen said at Kaleva's races.
Weather in London on Thursday.
It has been quite a challenge to get the technology together - whether it's cold stuff or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been a mess.
It makes no sense to consume energy in bad conditions.
Thanks to his 455, he won the World Cup.
We've got 445 outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to reach 460 on Friday.
Why not train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology got standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be an ideal race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little bit of wind, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official harassed politicians: “We don’t have any margins now or for many years.”
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in its hat and beware of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
According to him, there is no distribution.
Yle interviewed Virta, who had retired in 2015, at Wednesday’s Ykkösaamu.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, the unfolding proposals of politicians include raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and subsidising electric bicycles.
They are essentially indicative of the fact that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no margin for distribution now and for many years.
I think it’s even a fraud to talk about a split thief when you’re taking a debt,” Virtanen told Yle.
He pointed out that all debts are owed to children.
Virtas has extensive experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978 he started as a budget secretary in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as a deputy head of the budget department and as a budget manager.
The last time before he retired, he served as the Secretary General of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen noted that the 3% growth projection is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike from which we will start going down next year, and Finland is expected to grow by 1% for decades.
Washington to Change Permanent Residency Rules
President Donald Trump has announced that the Green Card rules will be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark’s wife doesn’t want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
A picture of Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband, Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried side by side, the Danish court said.
Traditionally, the rulers of Denmark are buried in the same place.
The House of Kings has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, this is due to the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” Court Communications Manager Lene Belleby said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s desire for a burial place and understands the decision.
Scary moment on the road: The car almost came on top of the highway
Tom had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened near Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family survived a car accident miraculously on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and the couple’s two small children drove on the motorway near Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the exit of Ring III to Hämeenlinna Avenue, a white car was driving along the acceleration lane, which was about to hit the side of the family’s car,” says Tommi.
If it hadn't been for the evasion, the car would have come on with Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car crashed into a railing at high speed.
The parents and the two children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is less than 3 years old, the other is less than 1 year old.
Apparently, we were pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one was even driving towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident occurred around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tomm, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency room.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and the family was checked.
The car was redeemed.
Tommi tells me that she and her cohabiting partner have a low income, and they received a grant from their family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the data of the other car, the family will not receive any money from the insurance, according to Tommi.
That's why the family wants eyewitnesses to see the car that caused the family to drive to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take children to the nursery and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's registration number was SIG.
If the culprit isn’t caught, I don’t know how we’re doing financially, even today we’re going to have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that anyone who has seen what happened or knows something about it will be in touch with the police.
The East-Uusimaa Police Department and the Central-Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
The title and article was corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally said in the story, the second car did not come by the lane of those coming in, but was driving from the acceleration lane to the side of the family’s car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the performance deals with human relationships with humor - The Exhibitionist will be seen in the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first directing to the What? theatre.
A self-revealer is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is treated with humor.
There are no bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been implemented with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he pulling a role or is he approaching another with his coat open?
Intriguing performance confuses fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it addresses people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Exposed One does not directly tell about his or her own relationships or those of the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my values will be affected by the show.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but neither do I think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of one hundred.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka will play in the performance.
The group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is composed by Jäppinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying for theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
We've got two years behind us and another one in front of us.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has started during the Kouvola years.
The teacher of the music classes has worked as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the Ylioppilasteatteri in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Directing is becoming more and more interesting.
The self-revealer premiered last week in Helsinki on Narri’s stage.
The 45-minute performance is expected to take place at least in the study town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Exhibitionist at the Kouvola What? Theatre on 4 August at 7 p.m. and 5 August at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a horrible motocross accident for a year - his cervical spine was broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The pair landing ace traveled around the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter in new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemijärvi resident has not tried at least once.
It inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I have been licking wounds at home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahti had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't use it to find boundaries.
It’s just so hard as a sport that it’s not worth too much exercising for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long run behind him as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started his career in Pest immediately after he ended his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn’t really do much, Lahti said.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged his protégés on the slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a great experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts didn’t make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be still.
I really enjoyed it, because for once I really just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It’s easier to find places that are broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speed sports.
I switched motocross to frisbee golf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not demand that his coaches be like him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our culture, there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been that way,” Lahtela says.
Sex Robots Are Coming and We Should Be Worried
It’s here: a report on technological advances in the sex robot industry – just as it was beginning to feel like 2017 couldn’t get any weirder.
Yes, sir.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the evolution of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
“We need to start taking sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, founder and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sexy robots are being bantered, but they're already sold quite a lot, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said at the announcement.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What’s even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts to the user’s personality as fully as possible,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
You may be tired, in the mood, or in the mood.
There are many worrisome aspects to the proliferation of sex robots: they replace real relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies as the user approaches robots that are programmed to be shy and resilient, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development reveal something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where oppression is an option among others.
Of course, most men don’t buy sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only begin to behave strangely or offensively when the market allows them to do so.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at a time when women’s rights are under threat around the world and there’s a president sitting in the White House bragging about harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrisome of its powerful imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and exhumed eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly short.
They are trying to make sex robots look like real women (in pornstar proportions) as much as is technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel authentic and their movements to mimic human movements as best as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will or history of their own – nothing that suggests independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by ISIS chief
The leader of the extremist group ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to carry the bomb on an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of ISIS had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be transported on July 15, but was interrupted before security checks.
Police do not explain why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device emitting toxic, colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a devil of common sense
During Trump’s term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong division of voters on a daily basis has also broken up families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory columns of American newspapers gave guidance on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubbles.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin came to visit me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet living in Chicago who's long been on the opposite side of the Republicans in our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin’s acquaintances — including the Republican sibling he’s been arguing with for decades about politics — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that’s a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new boost, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually drive us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we’re talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won’t be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more horrific possibility that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember with sadness Mitt Romney’s restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and we’ve seen his tax returns at least). Compared to Trump, they seem like very minor violations.
When Trump’s term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be lucid, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to Central Park's carousel, the biggest carousel in New York's park department and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses in the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror – are ominous, and the sparkling music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s hallmarks become disappointing over time: the view of tall buildings is getting bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality doesn’t match your dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven’t gotten over the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big roundabout in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but it doesn’t count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week at the department store I was asked to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
Same thing in a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but there I also get the opportunity to combine the estimate with 15% service money when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service to put their personality in a situation where they are not needed.
The saleswoman at the department store smiled with a sorry feeling when I gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter after lack of “management trust”
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqi from his duties as a representative coach.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former assistant coach, will be responsible for the coaching.
The rest of the team will continue in their current roles.
Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter’s coaching team in January, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets the incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so there was no other option,” H<0xC3><0xA5>kans said in a statement.
The Piccareta deal will last until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow’s home game against HIFK.
According to reports, the team has been in turmoil on Thursday.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, had been put aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta fought strongly against PS Kemi in the Inter match last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth in the 1980s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the photo, which makes it possible to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's sending a message.
If you don’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she is posing now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders he suffered when he was younger.
Twenty years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text, he had added the English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
At the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
Shortly afterwards, he also became ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts in his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he received after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original killing sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the bathroom.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius’ six-year sentence too mild.
The Prosecutor General plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be heard this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty does not exist in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Police arrested a group of people who were illegally encamped in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone who camps outside designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The court said the court could impose a fine.

Red Meat, Dairy Products and Chocolate May Alleviate Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in your digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that tryptophan, an essential amino acid in the protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, who led the study, immune cells guard the gut and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to the inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
In the experiments, immune cells that enhance tolerance were found in mice with specific bacteria in the intestines.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan to start producing immune cells, which is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of tolerance-promoting cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the gut," says Professor Colonna.
“The more tryptophan in mice’s diet, the more immune cells they had.”
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
Researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same species, which were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of mice, a normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the gut DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice that had grown in a sterile environment and did not have a gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transplanted small amounts of fluid —without the bacteria— into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerability-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s diet, the number of cells that strengthen their tolerability increased by about 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive system.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surfaces of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation."
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a "genius" after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" after signing with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted at Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who left Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, the last match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn’t in the best shape yet, as he wasn’t on the blue shirts Asia tour before the start of the season. He made it on the pitch for only 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, that needs to change before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has the innate ability to think football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to file his start line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by getting three of the four players he has given priority.
“Three out of four – I have to thank the club for that,” he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost their fourth qualifying match to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German standard of play is high.
Their game was even in every sector, Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two sets, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third set Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to rock along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective player was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Three of the four defeated Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent a summons in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Kremlin-related Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news agency, Reuters, confirms the information the Wall Street Journal revealed earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent out challenges related to the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaya, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the White House’s current advisor Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington marks a stepping up of the investigation into Russia.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist with an investigation into Russia’s interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller’s rights to gather evidence, send out summonses, and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will consider the evidence the prosecutor is investigating and decide whether the case should be prosecuted.
British inventor microchips himself to get home and into his car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now offers a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam’s BioTeq company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the microchip is installed to meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchip for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also makes locks for houses and cars compatible with a microchip.
Northam is married and has one child, and has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House Expo Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House’s southern lawn for an event showing American production cost taxpayers <0x24>24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as the Marine One when the president is on board. It was the attraction of an event held in the White House on July 17, 2017 to showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter to be stationed on a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, as evidenced by documents from the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail the day before the event to his superior, who is an Assistant Commander in the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn area on July 17th at 7 a.m. and the event would start at 3 p.m. The helicopter would leave the area only after the grass area was emptied between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House were delayed, a second crew would be required due to limitations in service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents obtained by TIME magazine do not indicate whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired if the incident was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed by the Senate at the time, as well as less stringent state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them in their travels.
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice bringing the president to the White House on the southern grassland to the nearest centimeters.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 rehearsal landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours on "non-presidential support missions" that day.
According to the White House, the incident did not cost taxpayers any additional expenses.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising the demonstration of the helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
The HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President’s duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, the flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are significantly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of reimbursement includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a study by RAND in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and probably employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to point it out.”
It’s unclear whether Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the driver’s seat.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three."
Lightning hits Vaasa railway - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical failure, the Railway Traffic Centre reports.

Venezuelan Prosecutor Calls for Right to Prevent Appointment of New Representative
Venezuela’s state prosecutor has filed a court decision that would prevent the country from appointing a new representative body.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the council elected last Sunday is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country’s constitution.
According to prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision has been requested because of suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an electoral fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the parliamentary vote announced that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated for membership, and the elected 545-member representative body includes, among others, Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Congress can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees constitutional reform as Maduro's way of strengthening his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have declared that they will not recognise the new assembly.
Maduro claims that the new council is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
Unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Several people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela went into economic crisis when oil prices fell.
Now, many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new congress is scheduled to begin.
Russian man sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
A Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a worldwide computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. request.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, according to the AFP news agency.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had earned millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian foreign ministry harshly criticised Finland after its arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement criticised Finland and the United States for making the arrest in Finland without Russia’s prior knowledge.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to hunt down usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to redirect Internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, vice president of the Department of Justice’s Crime Department, said the incident showed that the United States is also capable of pursuing other active cybercriminals.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected transcription of the sentenced person's name.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out of Action, So The Cali Cartel Will Star in Netflix's Hit Series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons of the series will be shown. The third season trailer has been released and presents the new villains of the series.
In its third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug-trafficking organization in the world.
The organization, run by four godfathers, operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that there is a bit more bribery and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, recruiting U.S. and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
The new faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional light artwork in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in kuava) will perform an exceptional light artwork in Paris on 16 May next year in honour of the UN’s first Day of Light.
Kola creates a light artwork in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
It illuminates the building of UNESCO headquarters, Fontenoy, and the Globe Monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I have experienced important concretely visible,” says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day,” Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening ceremony of the European Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO Headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to realise my art again at the UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanding significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the significance of light for humanity and to raise awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at the UNESCO Headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fighting in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a quarrel in the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when one of the parties accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal quarrel between the drivers.
The driver who drove in the forbidden direction would swing the driver of another car, as a result of which the car of the other driver would move, crashing into the car of the striker.
After that, he hit the hood of the crashed car.
In a preliminary speech, the man admitted that he had caused harm and had done wrong.
Timo Soini’s article titled “Then the Flood came”
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (USA) published a blog post on Thursday, headed by a question mark.
The book is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs in government.
After that came the flood, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
The text of Soini contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompador, is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the sayings “after us the Flood” or “after me the Flood” remain in the history books.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Political Role
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the UN relief mission, said there are hundreds of women candidates for provincial council elections, three women running for Vice President, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats against the elections, while the international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election is the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women’s input would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it 'eat and flee' tourism: staying only a few hours and rushing through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is suffocated by tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit into the crowd.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, with hotels replacing their homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are reported by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You will follow the flag-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back," describes Dario Franceschini, Italian Minister of Culture.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The population is also mostly affected by cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
They say tourism has damaged their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the population away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, said Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create the need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to move the cruisers further away from the historic centre.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Venetian administrative region, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Miles of traffic jams on the motorway
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the lane going north has been congested by kilometres since work on Thursday afternoon at the time of return traffic.
The area is undergoing motorway resurfacing work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a limit of 50 km/h instead of the normal 120 km/h speed.
However, even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon, practically at a walking pace.
The roadworks progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi near the statue of the Golden Goat.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
The 23-year-old runner has noticed the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published some amazing photos of herself in the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen to popularity in her current home country, Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-metre race in March by turning the track at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre hurdles with a Norwegian record of 55.38.
Working hard on social media, Iuel soon discovered after his record that celebrity and publicity have their downsides.
Men from all over the world began sending photos of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iouel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
"I got a lot of 'junk pictures' from strangers, so I had to make my account private," Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he received.
You can guess, Iul laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after the run, but I can do well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches do not ask for anything, they only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete,” Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record in the 400m and 400m hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korpe’s entire career at risk – now taking part in the World Cup: “I’m happy that it doesn’t hurt anything”
It’s been nice to count now that you haven’t hurt anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
The foot had been forced to the operating table in January, and the leg was unwilling to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit on the racetrack.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was doing, whether or not I was going to go on board.
Sponsorships were down and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to be sorted out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling back onto the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it when I first went on the snow.
I was like, hell, this is so much fun, let's have a couple more sessions.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September-October, but after a long recess, just training painlessly has been a big deal.
Only a few races have been rounded by the Korpi.
It doesn't matter.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I have never counted because of one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in a fever that week.
I can’t think of it that way, the corn says.
Today Korpi competes in the half-pipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though he doesn’t like to compete in individual competitions, he always catches fire from competing in a tough company.
According to Korvi, the appreciation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, although some of the skiers chose to host the X-Games in Norway at the same time.
This is a big show, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on what kind of conditions and level there are in the races.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-member Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The youngsters of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point myself that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings new energy to yourself, Korpi thinks.
Somehow I can still keep up on the slope, but otherwise I don't, that's how much power my friends have!
Against the background of his boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built another kind of sports career.
Director legend Pekka Korvi’s son is obsessed with racing: the boarder has his own horses for which he makes training programs.
When I travel all the time, I don’t have time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the race results and usually some starts, Korpi says.
Rail coaching and nutrition coaching are, according to Korvi, a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don’t want to go that far, but at least it’s a likely option.
I feel like I’m studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I’m trying to stay on top of the times and develop, maybe even drive some starts in the summer.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to start it when you’re already inside the sport.
The treatment also includes the Elitloppet Rafting Cruise organised with host Jaajo Linnomaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will be heading to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are now at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
We still have a few months to go and hope that the ship will be full, Korpi says with enthusiasm.
Attendo’s care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new nursing home for elderly people with 41 seats to be built in Kitee.
The 1,700-story building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, the neighbour of the health centre.
A common question for Kristie is where the new care unit will have enough customers, because during the Siu War many private care homes suffer from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that in the future there will be more demand for Kitee not only for alternatives but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikkala and Eerika from Kitee.
The transaction involved business, but the property is reportedly leased for five years.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations out of these modes.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about McVitie's continuing operations in Scotland
The union seeks confirmation from McVitie's cookie managers of its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the General Trade Union of the United Kingdom (GMB), the company has not disclosed any plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, which owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and representatives of trade unions would be "certainly first informed" if changes were to be made.
In a letter addressed to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of the production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, is deeply concerned that the factory manager is not able to provide clear information about Tollcross’ business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the high unemployment and low livelihood area.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising cost of living, and a steady reduction in production, eastern Glasgow desperately needs a thriving McVitie's production."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before, and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with our employees that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and locations in order to remain competitive.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
“We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility and are sure to be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we plan to make changes to the plant’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up Neymar's pursuit after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to end the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The team of the French Ligue 1 football series is ready to break the world record for transfer sums. The previous record was less than half: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer sum of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and the world’s best-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has left the club forcibly, and a source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the world of football about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they’re after our players, we’re going to be their opponents and we’re going to get in touch with their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they will have to deal with the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to be guilty of this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

Trump's phone calls were "invented" - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two phone calls cited by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s phone calls with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the scout organization have proved to be a fiction.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said no calls had been made.
He said Trump wasn’t lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
“These conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face,” Sanders said.
Speaking to Scouts Provoked Disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised him for his success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people will cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that the trip to the U.S. border will be difficult anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that the phone call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the scout organization said it was not aware of any of its leaders’ calls to Trump.
Michael Surbaugh’s earlier statement, apologizing to the scouts for Trump’s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at the scouting meeting was very surprising, as it was exceptionally political, given the nature of the event.
Among other things, he highlighted the results of last autumn’s presidential elections.
