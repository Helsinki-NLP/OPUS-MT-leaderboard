Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday showed a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the so far large coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Provincial Superior of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, but lost 5.5% of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP lost nearly 9% of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in post-war history in Austria, and in particular the results of the People’s Party, which led to early elections, are literally disastrous.
In early July, when he left the <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition, the EPP had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to polls.
However, the electorate has clearly been punished for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current vice-chancellor.
Observers expect this to take place at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency on Monday.
This development would probably facilitate the more likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP large coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% of the votes in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the votes in advance - however, the European Social Democrats also expressed their fears about the re-election of the 1999 European Union (FP<0xC3><0x96>) in 2005.
Haider, who has already stated his willingness to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to national politics in Vienna, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also came to parliament, but it lost some of its popularity and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the 4% threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relationships may be cooling down
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal insect collection was not solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be some cooling in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this in New York after his meeting with India’s partner Pranab Mukherji today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, there would be some cooling-off," he said after the meeting, which took place on Czech inspiration.
After the trial, Mukherji said it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of acquitted and fined Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could then apply for release on bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the Czech diplomatic chief said.
The only way for the Czech side to intervene in the whole case is to give the convict "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
However, he said the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
“Our primary interest with India is to maintain the best relationships with India with a long-standing tradition.
The Indians recognize this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
Asked whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister evaded the answer.
"I've already received a lot of promises," he remarked.
Czech judges fighting for the seabed
He moves on to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
Meanwhile, the area is as big as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is a member of the UN Division of Ocean and Sea Law’s 30-member team.
His boss, Václav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, the director of the division, follows the explanation, which he sometimes supplements.
There is work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, a world that is barely known.
There are oil, ore and other minerals, but there are also unknown living organisms that may be key to the development of cancer medicine, for example.
Seabed larger than land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new undersea areas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily about the so-called continental pedestal, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of a country.
Such a country shall have, under the Convention, the exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
To put it simply, we consider the part of the seabed and the underground layer of the continental shelf that is the natural continuation of the undersea continent.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles beyond the borders of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by a country to the Commission for the designation of the external borders of the Continental Plateau should be complemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The committee has dealt with five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have been successful so far," Mikulka adds.
Recently, Australia’s success echoed in the world and was the first to significantly expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed area awarded to it by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometres, or six times the land area of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
Their hopes are that the profits from the future use of the seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly making requests.
They may do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention as a “common heritage of humanity” begins.
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "some areas are legally clearly demarcated and their regime is contracted."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed nowadays also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, this organization, like investors from some other countries, was granted the status of “pioneer investor”.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than in the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of undersea copy of the Tatras.
“It can be produced on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says another Hindu lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian colleague of the division, gives an example of another specification.
It reminds you of a potato or a parchment with magical words that bring Golem to life.
German Special Forces Attended Hostage Release
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis, and experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt is becoming increasingly clear.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the airframe of the German Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were also at the site of the release.
Ministry spokesmen said on Monday evening that German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage takers allowed their captives to run and fled when they recognized the signs of a violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as a field support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers abducted a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts on September 19 in southern Egypt.
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were transported to and from the border region of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there is no information about when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on a German Air Force Airbus flight on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. House of Commons has overturned the <0x24>700 billion bailout proposed to the financial markets by a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell into the depths.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program did not get a majority to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the <0x24>700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic party’s negotiators, has called on MEPs to support the plan, even though it is so unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t even happened,” he said.
The Dow Jones dropped more than 6% and 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the rescue plan could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then fell again after the failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulences in the international financial markets.
The programme must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate in order to enter into force.
Directors are registering more and more reservations.
A good winter is coming for German tour operators.
According to a study, the traffic of road reservations for the next few months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ travel mood has not faded, according to the study.
In winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October increased by around 11 percent from October 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
The number of reservations has increased by about one third.
Particularly popular destinations for Germans are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as home landscapes.
“We’re mostly looking for organized trips,” said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for package tours can be “better calculated for passengers than for individual package tours.”
Passengers can save money by, among other things, pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so there will be an increase in turnover again compared to the previous year – although according to another study, fewer German tourists took a trip compared to the previous year.
The First Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted ballermann hits, liter jars of beer and celebrities wearing design dirndls.
Debut at Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really look a lot like each other.
She's blonde, she's a TV presenter, and she's wearing a tailor-made dirndl.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the peeking shop.
But one thing connects us: We’ve been at Wiesen for just three minutes, photographers are already running at us and loading their memory cards – I’m very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesen.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be doing its job.
As a Wiesn-tourist north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by folk costumes.
But when you get to Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or leather pants; no one looks resentful or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand can only be reaped by my dirndl apron.
A woman in Munich tells me that I tied the apron wrong: "You are free tied to the left, virgin in the middle, sold to the right, widow in the back."
I secretly knitted it from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says and laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirting techniques and wear a simple felt cover with the inscription "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and unsolicitedly show their naked butts.
The young man with the exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, lengthening the "aaaaaa".
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone sees as garbage.
So Bob's one of the notorious "prohibited urinators."
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8:00 p.m., ambulances are swarming around the scene to take care of the poor.
Sick nurses always appear in a team - four of them carry a covered stretcher tent-to-tent at the same time.
This works just like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure full.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarpaulin can't be seen.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics exclaims to me for my question, then in the turmoil.
Police named the victim of the accident.
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a car in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Brentwood-based resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, was involved in an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building encircles the ends of the platforms, each with a tower at the front corner, and looks like a German town hall in the countryside.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little sloppy.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large enterprise this was the westernmost gateway.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, wanted to achieve its ambitions of conquest of the Middle East with the help of this railroad from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded and destroyed the beautifully constructed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, it was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the whole eastern region, it serves - at least symbolically - as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in government – the AKP – has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is characterized by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, with Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP, Suat Kinikliogl.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of tumult, which gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the well-known AKP with Islamic roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This gave rise to some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specially designed for this purpose - located in a developing suburb, between semi-finished shopping malls and cafes. In the latter, middle managers in suits - men and women alike - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been fit for a right-centred politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit and a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry with him.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its rear.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to make a choice?"
"Turkey has never wanted to face a choice."
He then stressed what almost everyone I have spoken to here has almost automatically repeated: Turkey’s relations with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea countries, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, in a figurative sense, along with Turkey, the whole of Europe can travel to Asia and the Middle East on those railway lines to the east.
When I was again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who had watched the restoration of this magnificent building 100 years ago.
How they would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited in the harbour for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was once called the "sick man of Europe."
At the time, there was no question of which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologue, Sept. 11) has been the music director of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was consistent with the chorus's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music they put before him—whether it was a madrigal or a Messiaen piece, with no orchestral orchestra accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod say to us, "Let the music play on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it!”
His conducting technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever his music, he was always up to it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If ever there was an arm leader who should have been beaten as a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty or so years, I have written reviews of over 100 concerts, but I have never been disappointed with any of them, and I have often been enthusiastic about them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the heads of arms who, in his words, simply “galopped around the world with one or two well-known battlehorses.”
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to William Woodruff (25 September), "He continued his studies of economic history at Oxford in 1946 and became a scholar of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while constantly preparing for his bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees."
It comes from the author's notes in Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End," but it's false.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he actually resided in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It’s unclear why Woodruff made this period of his career more beautiful.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's "Flamenco and Life" exhibition because his black-and-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
Their simplicity and strength, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, have drawn my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation Jazz.
Although the passenger compartment of its predecessor was already large enough, the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
All this combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, it has undergone a number of internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, a new body, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less well-known in Europe, but it breaks sales records in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car brand in 2002 and 2008 as well.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since it was released.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while the Japanese company sold 83,000 Jazz in 2007, the target for 2009 is to sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, the Honda Jazz has sold 8,000 units on the Spanish market, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
For the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2,000 copies sold over the course of a year.
In fact, it is the arrival of the new Jazz that will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda’s sales in Spain.
The company expects 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain from 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
We also want to increase this to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid - 4,370 mm in length - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide every year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market share would be made up of the United States, while the rest would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight’s commercial launch is scheduled to take place in the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3,900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width 1,690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2,500 mm.
Its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has also become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed both by the new body and the fuel tank in the centre – this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total load space of the so-called double-floor boot has increased, currently weighing 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that these dimensions apply to the model with the 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz has a boot size of 379 liters.
Some exterior modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear led lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the doors for the rear seats have been raised to an angle of 80 degrees, as opposed to the 67 degrees of the front Jazz.
The second-generation jazz engines are also new.
At the start of its distribution, this small model is available with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gearboxes.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both engines are more fuel efficient than their previous model, with lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical alignment, while delivering outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 hp in the previous generation, now reaches 100 hp.
The 1.4-horsepower Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoiding "bee car"
To develop accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has drawn inspiration from nature, specifically the bee world, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that imitates the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C could be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and Research and Development, defines the BR23C as a further expansion of Nissan’s four-level safety protective shell.
The robot enhances the collision avoidance capabilities of the company’s products.
While flying, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety protective shell.
More important than this, however, is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To duplicate the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
The instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres at 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into a collision avoidance action.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collisions, imitating the movements of the uterus.
What distinguishes the system most from the currently available instruments is that in this case the avoidance maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the reverse maneuver cannot be oriented upwards or downwards, nor can it move diagonally, only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the turnability of the wheels, that is, not in the infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan has also implemented a rotational function in the robot to avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process data every few seconds and respond to it.
No data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres is required, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it’s not really Gigabyte, and we’re not even talking about megabyte memory.
This is the first step in the development of an instant collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates will enter production cars within ten years.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional application to bring the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, besides having a lot of cash to invest, is not lacking in common sense.
With the crisis on their necks, and so Americans don't get caught up in the mazes of dubiously solved mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called the "Bad Credit Hotel."
This is the bad credit hotel... or the bad ones.
The look of the accommodation and especially the receptionist’s grieving face suggests that we should think about it again, twice, or rather three times, whether the time for borrowing has just come.
And most importantly, where to apply for a loan, because that is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
What would happen if we added to the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
It’s not even a dream to buy a home...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announces a share of its capital in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay <0x24>9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the Morgan Stanley stock price fell sharply on the stock market.
A week after the announcement of the preliminary agreement, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, or <0x24>3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional <0x24>6 billion in purchases of convertible securities, which provide a 10% return, with an exchange rate of <0x24>31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the transaction will be executed at an average rate of <0x24>29, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock price fell by 6.79% around 5 p.m., closing at <0x24>23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which will allow it to diversify its activities while at the same time becoming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The deal with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
The terms of the deal have been changed over the past few days, with Morgan only announcing on Monday that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would be made up entirely of ordinary shares," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's managing director in Tokyo, said in a statement.
However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and prevent potential risks.”
Regarding the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share will be reduced by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year if the trading price of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it will increase to about <0x24>47.
In doing so, Morgan Stanley ensures that funds from MUFG can help you capitalize on your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet, and increase your liquid resources.
A spokesman for the group, however, did not want to provide accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG merger, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved "definitely" since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great trial for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of its non-payment risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Of the big investment banks, only one "survivor" remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had earned <0x24>15 billion: part of this comes from Berkshire Hathaway, a Warren Buffett group of companies.
Statement by Rafael Correa, Quito
The rebuilding of the republic in the spirit of 21st-century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his colleagues and friends, Correa explained her ideas on the new constitution on Sunday.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum, according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted against, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes were cast unfilled.
The draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a counting by a non-governmental organization proved the huge prevalence of “yes” votes with 63% and 70%, respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has been a sweeping victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, its governor's seat, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Observatory Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main theme was a 444-point text summarizing the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, preserving the state’s right to “plan development” for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and the currency sent by emigrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the presidential mandate in February 2009.
The president has already begun introducing free healthcare and education in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population live below the minimum income.
Finally, the Constitution forbids the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the Quito-Washington agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility that underpins U.S. anti-drug measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian squad attacked the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad this morning.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Cairo International Airport, around 2:30 p.m.
The hostages were banned from speaking to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and the kidnappers “have not been paid a ransom,” Egypt’s tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said.
The hostages were captured on September 19, at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in an off-road safari.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organized the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived in two helicopters and attacked the hostage takers just before dawn.
"There was a gunfight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," the leader said.
He also said a total of 150 troops had been sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were complemented by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian task forces.
“We have to admit that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and action teams,” he said without giving further details.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had intercepted a SUV during a patrol on which the kidnappers were travelling, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two of them.
The military said the hostages were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization immediately denied.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
Newspapers and the current election campaign are currently focusing on the debate on the financing of culture.
That's all we can be happy about.
But a portion of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will raise his voice to shed light on the ridiculous sums spent on small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical monuments on the verge of starvation?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and cultural heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in either Quebec or Canada that actually ensure effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, elected representatives and all government agencies.
Within the framework of the Fédération des Sociétés d’Histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers of the Society for History, Cultural Heritage, Archives and Genealogy are engaged in historical research and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth and protest with the last force of drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone ever stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which was the first European to be in trouble due to the spill-over effect of the U.S. credit market crisis: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands met at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the bank’s case can therefore be considered to be a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will acquire nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s existing assets.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including in particular the activities acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amró, mainly insurance.
Fortis shares began to fall steeply last week, with serious crisis phenomena at the Institute already in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell by about 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the group’s total market capitalisation is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but this is not realistic according to the company’s directors.
The board blamed the overseas market uncertainty associated with the adoption of the US <0x24>700 billion package for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers had risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has applied for a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract based on people’s medical records.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that always makes the use of prescription data subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in independent hands, or we'll leave the fox to the henhouse," Richard Dicke, the developer of the drug-compliant program, quoted in the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health of the client, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not insure it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: he could easily obtain from pharmacies what drugs he had bought in the past year and a half, based on the customer’s identification number, and the program itself infers from his illness and state of health.
For example, taking high doses of cholesterol lowering medication on a regular basis suggests that your blood lipid levels are practically uncontrollably high, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also specify a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do besides paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include the fact that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraine or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former not.
Separate companies have been formed to retrieve and process the data, and they ask the patient’s consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now also processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies are gaining access to data, and controlling its use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate Health Data Protection Act, but it only applies to health care providers and insurers.
The Congress has before it a bill that also gives the authorities control over companies specializing in data reporting.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his program, which would make the transfer of data subject’s explicit consent conditional.
Another issue is that the person concerned can hardly refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the goodwill of the fox.
The Global Menu of Marseille
The EU and India will double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this subject, alongside other largely global issues.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, where nuclear cooperation will be the main topic.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic superpower that should have more say in international affairs, the member states have not yet reached a common consensus on whether to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the European Union José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade flows to more than EUR 100 billion in five years.
Given that trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this context, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, meaning that air traffic could also rise in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth in the EU’s list of partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism - the latter in all its forms - was condemned on both sides and urged to convene a UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both have played a large part in the failure to date.
The EU has reaffirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed that the next climate conference should be a global deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent the rise in food prices, and they supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is headed to the French capital today, where he is preparing to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, French companies are expected to be awarded 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses in Frankfurt
Italian publishers have a strong presence at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international copyright meeting.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will be attended by 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, covering a floor area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State at the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room in the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where data, trends and prospects on the state of Italian publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily declining, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane was found missing a year ago
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane were found on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “After determining the location of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it was the plane that Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared,” he said.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said a committee of inquiry had been called in a few hours after the wreck was discovered to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also, in California, near the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s in the name of Fosset, issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set a number of peaks that made him enter history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the earth for the first time with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he went around the world by plane, without landing.
Among his many records is the flight over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters, carried out by a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and distinctive hobby rover with large surfaces and clear corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact off-road vehicle”, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the launch campaign for the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign that accompanies the launch of the new vehicle uses a media-communication device that is so far unknown, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by car brands in Italy.
The billboard action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the surround presentation of the car, in which the new SUV, with special spectacles distributed around the Corso Como, will be visible in almost real-world dimensions and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel as if the car is standing out of the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, to form a unified image.
With this promotion, Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Can this attract the interest of prospective customers? We will see.
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are
Young people from Triveneto, they'll probably be banned from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now embarrassing all of Italy? They are members of a group called 'Ultras Italia', which has been following the national team for years and which, to be honest, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never faced the opponent’s fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small scattered groups from Campania and Apulia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were waved with the name of the supporters' hometown: they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleader team, the Levski fans.
The Italian football federation provided Italian fans with 144 tickets, which were named tickets, making it easier to check the supporters' team.
The Ministry of the Interior checked everyone: among those who were about to go to Sofia, there was no one to be prosecuted, no one to be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a football-related record were denied entry and exit.
The Ministry of the Interior is currently awaiting the minutes from the Sofia police, and will then take the necessary measures: supporters who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
It is an international ban that applies not only to visits to Italian stadiums, but also to all stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we must also fear that hooligans will find followers, that is, that the fewer than one hundred and fifty people will be joined by others.
“We must put out this fire immediately, and we must not excuse anyone who behaves in this way,” the Ministry of the Interior said in a statement.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s national match is approaching, in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultrasonics.
The Observation Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday the Committee for the Safety of Sporting Events, which can count on a department of the Homeland Security Service, will meet with the intelligence services dealing with fan behaviour.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arms under the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
This idea was expressed, quite unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as head of the Ministry of the Interior’s observation service (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli previously served as the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultra Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria it is not forbidden to live with the Duce, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was still disgraceful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first officer of the observation service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let us also talk a little about the whistling of the Italian anthem: it is not a crime, but, if I may say so, it is not a good education...”
