Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after it emerged that the National Assembly should rather be called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, MEPs from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title could make them look ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his group was worried that their new name would rhyme with the words “Twp” and “Pwp”.
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple, and pwp means poop.
A representative of the Plaid party said the entire faction was “unsatisfied” and therefore proposed alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his group was “open” to the name change, however, he noted that the MWP was just a leap from “Muppet”.
It is worth noting here that in Welsh, the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as in Yorkshire English "u", i.e. MWP is pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: “With regard to the titles for the appointment of members of the National Assembly, the final decision is, of course, in the hands of the Members of Parliament.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposed name of the Welsh Parliament, which received widespread support.
With regard to the titles of Members, the Commission prefers the title of Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation favoured the alternative to MWP.
MEPs come up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather cumbersome, which creates a problem for National Assembly president Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly in other areas, including disqualification of Members and committee structures.
MEPs will be able to cast their final vote on the issue of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds referendum to change country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim, and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO accession.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the name change and will not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that they have to make in order to join the EU and NATO.
Churches in Harlem in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin have also been silenced
“In the past, as I hear from the older ones, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“None of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People are different these days,” he says.
“Bars aren’t the living rooms that people go to every day.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will return to where they started.”
And instead of the churches, he adds, there will be residential buildings whose residential community will also not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy homes in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further speed up the closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these homes will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem grew into a city of blacks—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson—the Reverend is known for leading a boycott of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street, against blacks or their business owners who refused to sell their products.
In 1939, a fire damaged the building, but during the renovation the bell was built for the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the bell as "the bells of the poor."
According to the expert who played the bell in July, this bell play is “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable, historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago joined the larger bell tone of the Riverside church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin did not hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin in recent months, a complex situation has unfolded with the participation of architects and contractors, who were involved in part by the secular leadership of the church and in part by the episcopal office.
The presiding body of the parish, the parish council, wrote to the bishop’s office in July, complaining that the office would “transfer the expenses” to the council, although the council was not involved in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency around the office.
A 13-year-old boy in California is attacked by a shark while fishing for crab.
According to official reports, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded by a shark while fishing for crabs on the opening day of the crab season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy calling for help.
At first, Hamel thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“At his clavicle, his shoulder was torn,” Hammel said, describing what he saw when he approached the boy.
"I started screaming out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" he said.
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently under critical care.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the press that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a non-human species.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
During the investigation, and for safety reasons, the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) was closed for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's expands into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert vendors and large-scale shop-style piperestands for the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its steadily growing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion growth in the UK beauty market, the chain is testing larger piperestants in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the bathroom line is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in different ways.
Sainsbury’s said it is doubling its offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But the earlier brands, L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, will also be placed in larger areas on brand-specific stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup line, in which the majority of products are now vegan – which is now being sought after by an increasing number of young shoppers.
Fragrance Shop also tests its appearance at two Sainsbury’s stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other in Birmingham’s Selly Oak this year.
With the spread of online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small local stores, stores need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says the supply will become more and more similar to the mixed stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened Argos-classes and some Habitat-classes in hundreds of stores – a move that has had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The store chain’s previous attempt to lift wrinkles in the beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots, but the dispute over the distribution of the revenues of its department stores ended it.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business at its 281 stores to the Lloyds pharmacy chain Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “By reshaping the look of our piperests, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we hired qualified staff to advise those interested.
Our brand offering caters to every need, while the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide the attraction that will take the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'running' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, has left "out of control" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for her lifestyle product business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly brand that sells home wear and accessories.
The business of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand, co-branded by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning has announced on Instagram that he is quitting.
Holly Willoughby pulled the plug at Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she quit her promising lifestyle product business at the last minute – to focus on her own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “running” when television’s sweetheart on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Jones’s business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that due to new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in total, he didn’t have enough time to devote to their joint brand of home wear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities’ businesses had previously been compared to the Goop brand, which was listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island country for a holiday home.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to do that in the long run, and that would be his livelihood for the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the start.
At the office in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods to sell."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars, thanks to huge amounts of money invested in choices ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, and possible slippages.
It can also be the end of an old friendship.
The three-child hostess and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp back in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will become M&S' product face and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones’] business.”
There were hard words, “then we fell in love.”
He joked about what criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider “unpresidential,” and for having said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump asked in a funny “news reader” tone.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
Kim said he would like to meet for a second time after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, a representative of North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, there is no “appropriate response” on the part of the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
“It’s going to be great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had given positive results – the end of the missile tests, the release of the hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was speaking in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Behaving as a president isn’t difficult, but now there aren’t 10,000 people out there trying to get in, just 200 people standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia after tsunami and earthquake
Indonesia refused to provide assistance after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had to be evacuated, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
"In the past, in many cases, it has been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies need to be involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in the Aceh province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
Although there was a tsunami signal, the apparent lack of a tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to a disaster that claimed lives.
Transportation between Indonesian islands can be difficult even in the best weather.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of worn-out infrastructure in Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign, and has not saved money on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president faces ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have begun to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be displaced as a result of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with scrub trimmers, bows and arrows, and other heated weapons.
Video: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge scores a huge match against Chelsea
In a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Sturridge scored a goal in the 89th minute and saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea.
His team lost 0–1 when Sturridge received an injection from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate.
He first put the ball to the left, then started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot stretched high above the sixteenth and went to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net over the projecting Kepa Arrizabalega.
“I just wanted to be in position because there’s always someone like Shaq to play the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in a better position,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, and I just took it off, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea drove 1–0 in the half, after taking the lead in the 25th minute with a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball with a corner to the blues, then managed to break into the midfield and rush into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> started after a quick injection and got the ball back in the midfield.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful transfer to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense, and finally fired a left shot to send the ball to the far corner at Liverpool's goal next to Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples as the next stop of the Champions League group matches.
Chelsea will play against Videoton at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday.
Indonesia Tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency said on Sunday.
As a result of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and the 6-metre-high tsunami waves that followed it, several people were buried under the ruins, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, are covered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of the stabbed woman
Police opened an investigation into a murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's sting-covered body was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has already been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are requesting the residents of the area to report to anyone who has seen anything or is dead.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I would like to ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and who may have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to contact us as well, as they may have information relevant to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, her friends came to the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are currently informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building and leave it.
When he learned what had happened, the man could not speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours before they can enter the building again.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
“That’s awful,” he repeated.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police microbuses were inside the cordon, and another one was outside the cordon.
Several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30, 247 file.
The Cromwell Parliament Statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The banishment of the statue might be poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical puritans, who at one time ravaged England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick’s proposal is “foolishness,” an “ attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current debates about the removal of the statues.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of the image was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s impressive Cromwell depiction reflects the views of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that many still consider to be celebrated today.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps fewer than at the end of the nineteenth century, yet many consider him a protector of the parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this picture is accurate is still the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this strife, which broke out in the middle of the 17th century, influenced the future destiny of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are to be celebrated and commemorated.”
Murderer pig wounds Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and wounded to death a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified by his last name as Yuan was found with blood covered and a torn artery next to a pigyard in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He travelled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's carcass and discovered that the door of the neighboring pigyard was open.
According to him, the mouth of the giant swine in the pigyard was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and torn apart,” said a relative named Wu by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the pigyard at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been sealed off so that it could no longer harm others, while police were investigating the clues on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although not often, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in Massachusetts and caused him life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales pushed a farmer into his tractor until his wife managed to alarm him.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were generally not prone to attack, but that the taste of blood could make them aggressive.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Severe rains following hurricane Rosa in southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it reaches the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck as a Category 1 hurricane at 140 km/h at 5 a.m. E.C. on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and heads west towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it floods the southwest of the United States with heavy tropical humidity as a tropical storm.
Storms can bring up to 25 cm of precipitation to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the nearing low-pressure fog will cause heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
Here, 3–10 cm of precipitation can cause sudden floods, floods full of debris, and landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can bring between 5 and 8 cm of rainfall per hour, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, precipitation is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
Especially during tropical rains, it is not recommended to go on foot in the desert.
Due to heavy rainfall, canyons can turn into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds.
Coming low-pressure masses could cause heavy rainfall in some places off the coast of southern California.
Rainfall of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small floods and slippery road conditions full of debris.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers can occur in Arizona as early as Sunday evening and Monday morning, and then on Mondays during the day and Tuesdays, rain covers wider areas.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as Arctic air masses cool down, but tropical ones remain rather warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences even over short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 10 degrees.
The summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas in the coming days.
The temperatures in the central and eastern United States are expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from the southern Great Plain to parts of the Northwest between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
Long-term weather forecasts suggest temperatures in the eastern U.S. will likely exceed average temperatures by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers were interested in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate remained unresolved, and broadcasters had to cut off regular broadcasting due to a last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh grabbed him at a high school party and tried to undress him.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The statements were likely seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated average viewing numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen finds it difficult to measure the number of people who watch shows at their workplace.
For comparison, this is the number of spectators used to be for the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which features experts supporting Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day’s audition.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS watched 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest has not diminished after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that the senator would vote for Kavanaugh, it was shown on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a loud crowd of protesters were receiving him as he climbed up the elevator to attend a meeting of the judiciary committee.
He was staring for a few minutes while the crowd was blaspheming him, and CNN was broadcasting the scene live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted to him, “You have the power to do what so many women don’t.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share his statement at a committee hearing.
On the cable and broadcast channels, hours later, it was shown live as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be submitted to the entire Senate for vote.
However, Flake said he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, as demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision in conversations with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision made the right use of his power, as it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of threatening the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation through political play.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview appearing directly on May’s front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea that Britain and the EU should handle each other’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on charges of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Police released a video of the fight between the Sims and Simpson, and announced that Sims’ glasses had fallen off during the fight.
Police found the glasses and Simpson's DNA on the scene, according to a WAFB channel on the CBS network.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate report, the court set the bail at <0x24>350,000.
A preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge County coroner said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The agency thanked Louisiana State Police for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva thanked the relevant law enforcement authorities for their “dedicated and persistent work in finding out the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
In the last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims’ death had “shouldered” and “shocked” the team.
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ash
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After the volcanic activity in the crater intensified and a total of 183 gas and ash spills occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The centre has observed several rumblings and quakes.
Images on social media sites in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, show that cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital, after a 7.1 earthquake hit the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protesters on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s split-separate referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint dust at the stormtroopers that held them back, so the streets, which were crowded with tourists, were now covered with dense dust paint.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a baton.
The pro-independence groupings, which were chanting the slogan “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, and the pro-unity protesters behind the slogan “Long live Spain” have stood against each other for hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions in the independence-stricken region remain unresolved following a referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A large majority of voters voted in favour of secession, although the turnout was rather low, as the majority of Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting in polling stations with actions that led to aggressive clashes.
Independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was not prevented, the demonstration did not proceed on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
“I’ve seen my parents cry tears of joy for us to vote for, but now our cause has stalled,” he said.
Although last December’s regional elections resulted in a substantial, even scarce, victory, Catalan independence parties have found it difficult to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their best-known leaders have voluntarily exiled or are awaiting a court ruling on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic who recorded the police-supporting demonstration on her phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention for trials since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“The best way to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents is to take part as a candidate in the European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their car into a house
Police have arrested a 33-year-old, a 34-year-old and a 39-year-old man who crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. British summer time at the Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car may even have been shot with an armored bow.
Menga scored 1–0 against the Rangers by Livingston
Dolly Menga scores her first goal for Livingston
Livingston was a big surprise to the Rangers when he got Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the Ibrox club for 18 games, to his second defeat.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, as Gary Holt's team was in a dead end with Hibernian's team in second place.
The Gerrards remain without a foreign win in the current season of the Scottish league, and face the first-place Hearts team next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
However, the Rangers still have a match ahead of them in the Europa League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its division invincibility series to six victories, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet lost to the team.
Livingston missed a number of situations against the inaccurately playing guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before a single goal of the match, as they caused the Rangers a lot of problems with their attacking game.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but pulled the attack too long, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt to slip into Craig Halkett's ball crossed in front of the goal line turned out to be wide.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure they could distract the guests in the fixed play situations.
The decisive goal was born precisely from this situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it to score from mid-16.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in possession of the ball, but the domestic defense proved impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's goal was barely compromised.
This trend continued during the second half of the match, with the exception of one situation in which Kelly had to defend the attack of Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman's attempt was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost another free kick at Livingston.
Two penalties were not awarded to the attacking team: one for Halkett's entry against the substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for his hand.
“Phenogenic” game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena Reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland Correspondent
Livingston performed phenomenally and took the credit.
The players performed well and exceeded expectations one by one.
The members of the team and their playing style have hardly changed since they returned to the front line, but Holt’s efforts also deserve considerable recognition, as the coach has been very uplifting the team since his arrival.
Many players have taken their best form.
Halkett played a huge role with his excellently organized defenses, and Menga really sweated Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played with no idea.
No matter how well Gerrard led them at times, they were unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing in the formula – they only managed to break the home defense once anyway – so the Rangers had to get together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdogan found mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of Turkish and German leaders in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) was characterised by a pleasant atmosphere and cheerful spirit.
This was the last day of Erdogan’s divisive visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s EU membership.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then travelled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
Police have banned a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but several supporters of the president have appeared to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed disapproval of Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to receive the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations illustrate the divisive nature of the president’s policy, which is celebrated by some German citizens of Turkish descent as a hero, while others see it as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist crashed into a car and lost his life
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic highway in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, who died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Police in London said police are still working on the man’s identity to inform his relatives.
The investigation has resulted in road blockades and bus diversions, and authorities are advising drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a high-security man's prison, the prison's directors said.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at the Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire and have not yet been contained.
In order to deal with the situation, the authorities deployed a special forces force called the Tornado, which involved eight prisoners who were confined to a wing of a building.
All the members of the Special Forces suffered were minor head injuries, which they managed to treat on the spot.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Organization said: “A specially trained team of prison guards is handling the situation at Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons. The perpetrators will be handed over to the police and will face further imprisonment."
The Long Lartin men's prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And last October, special forces were also needed to defeat a serious riot in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is expected to be the case early next week when the remains of hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has ordered flood alerts Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rains.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within a 200-mile radius of Phonenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
For example, Hurricane Katrina (1967) approached the border of AZ for 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the south-western desert (Central Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) precipitation is expected to be between 25 and 50 mm, but in some places it may be as high as 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa could bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning mares, as the area is currently suffering from severe drought.
Although floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on drought-stricken southwest regions.
"According to the U.S. Drought Observation Service, more than 40% of Arizona's territory is hit by a minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category," the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It will remain hurricane-powered and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, will pass about 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land bridge in Mexico, and will be heading north at about 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its strength.
It is expected to hit the coast of Mexico again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rain can be expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
"The rainfall can cause an average of 70-150 mm of precipitation from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where it can be 250 mm of precipitation at times," the report said.
Rosa then travels north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning on Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression by then, sweeping across Arizona to the southern Utah area by Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains will be the expected extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the desert areas in the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening thunderstorms and sediment flows in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas should be feared.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested on Suspected Attempt to Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
At 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, an injured teenage boy was found in an area of Midsomer's Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital and his condition was “stable”.
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man had been arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities are asking the public to contact anyone who has a mobile phone record of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh had to endure “the hatred and anger of the Democratic Party”
“Anyone who votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure “the hatred and anger of the Democratic Party” during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday when he vehemently and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had sexually assaulted her as a teenager decades earlier.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood up for his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans could see with their own eyes" Kavanaugh's "brilliant and fearless character" that day.
“The votes for Judge Kavanaugh are those of one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, with an impeccable public service record,” Trump told West Virginia supporters.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Only five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not going to run, but I’m going to run, he said.
“That’s why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are following a tactic of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican advisor told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake tsunami, number of deaths rising
Many were swept by the flood, and at least 384 people died when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of almost six meters (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, dragging many people away and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning came out yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, did not flee immediately, and became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come on its own, cars, logs, houses and everything else was dragged off the coast," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching the coast.
Some of them climbed up to the top of the trees from the flood and were saved, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters.
Airborne images of the disaster show a number of demolished buildings and shops, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
Earthquakes were detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday’s earthquake released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions may have amplified the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was “significant,” with thousands of homes destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsing.
The bodies of several victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and 29 more are being searched for.
Nugroho said in a statement that the number of injured and damage to the area called Donggala, on the coastline 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, could be even greater as it was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications are “completely paralyzed, there is no way to get information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, which also announced that the organization’s experts and volunteers are already on their way to the affected area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse," they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday for not informing the public about the tsunami that hit Palu, but the leadership said the waves had already reached the shores when the alarm was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media shows a man from the upper floor of a building making desperate shouts to warn people on the streets of an approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, dragging cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet confirmed the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power cuts, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army has sent relief supplies by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate relief work and will remain closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by Tula on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tent sheets erected in the office yard, but on their way they encountered traces of horrific destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“It’s very bad.”
While the relief teams were preparing for disaster relief, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in the field were unable to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief and personnel coming from overseas can only be admitted to the country if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The incident continues to be treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international relief services to enter, but so far no announcements have been made.”
On the second evening after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing ones continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escapes would smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of the reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer during rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who had been trapped by her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month, this time in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what happened puts a great emotional burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among paragliders, he spent hours desperately trying to reach the competitors on WhatsApp who were attending the seaside festival.
But instead of two blue ticks, only one grey tick appeared.
"I think this means that the messages could no longer be delivered," he said.
<0x24>26,750 stolen while charging an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink’s associate who was filling up an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee mall, Newport Police Department said in a press release.
The driver of the cash truck was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to fill it with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man approached Brink’s employee from behind while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but the exact number of suspects is not stated in the police statement.
Anyone who would like to provide information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper's name has changed to Yére
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The creature formerly called Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and this was the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
He announced the name change before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
In the show, she will take the place of Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for “emotional reasons,” the producer said.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper's current artistic name - according to his previous revelations, it has also religious significance for West.
"I know that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier when talking to radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
So I am you and I am us and we are all one.
Kanye means the only thing, and it became Ye, which symbolizes the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he will be using the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied several times as to whether his name should be written together, with a dash, or in capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to deploy army against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has pledged on the upcoming 50th anniversary of the student protests, which have resulted in a bloodbath, that he will never use the military against civilians.
López Obrador said on Saturday that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration, killing about 300 people when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by providing students with monthly financial benefits and plans to set up more free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are two of the main factors driving young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence solutions, who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced plans to become the world’s number one AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the U.S. and the next breakthrough in AI is imminent,” Lee said.
By doubling research grants, the chances of the next big step in artificial intelligence being taken by the United States could double, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China’s most significant companies, Face+, MI.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that succeeded in defeating the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the U.S. government-announced technology competitions, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, as it would be an opportunity to find new future shapers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the government support they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that steals the scientific leaders, it’s the big corporations,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired several large university skulls to work in the field of AI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could help the U.S. efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that people who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically receive a green card," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s national science foundation provides support to academic institutions in a similar way as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other governmental organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which planned to set up a national security AI committee, has not taken any further steps in the matter for months.
Macedonia to hold referendum to change country's name
The Macedonian population voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”. This step would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country’s application for EU and NATO membership from being accepted.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbor indicates that it wants to claim the Greek territory of the same name, so it has vetoed the country’s NATO and EU membership so far.
The two governments reached a deal in June on the new name of the state, but nationalist opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of mostly Slavic Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Does the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev at the forefront, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, as one of the countries that rose up on the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance to become a member of the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they feel bound by the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
According to the State Election Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout so far was only 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately accounted for 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children, because our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in favour of the name change in a referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) erected a small stage, chairs and tents for the boycotters of the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with pride, with raised heads, and not through the servant’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could count on investments in Macedonia that a country with unemployment above 20% would need.
“I think the majority will support our cause because more than 80% of the country’s population is fundamentally in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said.
He added that the “yes” vote is “a safeguard for the future of the country.”
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Science last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, a participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
70% of those who wanted to vote said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote above 50%.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player scoring the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have successfully defended Brighton, winning Manchester City 2–0 at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield as the first step of the attack, and
He escaped between the three Brighton defenders to the open field.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He cheated on a defender and ran several times close to the Brighton Sixteen.
Then he passed to the left of Sterling, who appeared there.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero by force, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of the gate of Brighton netkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has leg problems," Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
“We agreed to play for 55, 60 minutes at most.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
Sterling's action gave the blues the initial advantage in the English championship match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero, who was on the Brighton side of the field, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane played the ball for a while before starting Sterling on the long.
For the Blues, he could just swipe the ball into the goal before slipping outside the base line.
City will play in the Champions League with Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday from 12:55.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
Since the Nationals missed the chance to get into the after-season, they had no reason to really work hard.
However, Scherzer is always looking forward to playing against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs. The Rockies have a one-match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one consolation spot with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but their first division title is still pending.
“Regardless of the fact that we no longer have a chance, we can stand up to them with the audience and the other team’s mood in Denver expected to peak now compared to the whole year.
Of course I am in the mood to get on track like that!”
The Nationals have yet to select the starting player for Sunday, but it is reported that Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
For Scherzer, who took part in a throwing practice on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting throw on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed D.C. player will be 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts this season after 220 and 2/3 of the game.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation around the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“It’s one of the big guys, the big guys – I’m not running, but I’m running, so I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump added: “Everyone can see what these dreadful, radical Democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can use any means to regain power, malice and vileness can be seen.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample to get control, they get the power, that's what they want, control and power, but we won't let ourselves."
The president said the Democrats would use “resistance and obstruction.”
"You've seen all this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "furious and malicious and vile and liar."
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee, to whom the assembled crowd expressed loud displeasure.
“Do you remember what he replied?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, no, no, wait – all with very bad body language, it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I was not at all surprised when the activists of Momentum in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last of a long line of Labour Members who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has been treated in the same way for his unwavering opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, what censorship didn’t like was that I didn’t agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the same issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with the former leaders.
The invitation to the Labour meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that they wanted a “inclusive and productive meeting.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, the tone has changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, more polite” policy has been forgotten, if ever realized.
It is increasingly striking that the Labour Party does not tolerate differences of opinion, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have been increasingly demanding that I turn my back on my individual opinions and take a stand on things that I would otherwise never agree with, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches – no matter what I actually said – they start to slander me on social media, demand my resignation, criticize the center-right policy, and tell me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are usually limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues in politics who are forced to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis and yet do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the Labour Party’s need to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with every “distrust” motion and every change in the electoral rules, the tolerance of the party is narrowing.
Over the years, many have advised me to hold back, not to be so outspoken, and then “everything will be fine.”
That’s not why I went into politics.
Thirty-two years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed, and then I fought for better public care for the most deprived, both as a local councilor and as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, nor did I do otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what my political positions were and on which issues I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and energy has to be devoted to questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political purpose will deter me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.
Chris Leslie, Representative of Nottingham East
Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr hits the top
Two late attempts made some changes in the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr will win the most entertaining match of the day, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, being the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and superior situational use, they have won, so the homeowners and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve had to face a lot of challenges in our games so far, but we’re still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Melrose player Robyn Christie said: “We have to admit that Ayr has taken advantage of its situations much better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt to score Frazier Climo took Ayr's advantage, but thanks to a yellow card lent by the Warriors to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, Melrose could have done the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt failed.
Climo swept Ayr's defense with a penalty, just in the half, and then scored points from a single-player attempt, resulting in a 17-5 result in the first half in favor of Ayr.
Melrose had a strong start in the second half, with Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, reducing the team's drawback to five points.
Then the game lasted for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and had to be taken off the pitch, and in the continuation Ayr further increased his advantage with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, whose laurels were reaped with the help of Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson also received a yellow card, and Melrose succeeded in stopping Bruce Colvine's attempt, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started catching up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dismantling Climo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's assault team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after re-starting when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent forward Gregor Henry for the homeowner's fifth attempt.
The protagonist of Still Game has begun a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be moving towards the hospitality industry: it turns out that he has become the head of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays with his old comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the next season will be the ninth, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow’s “blossoming catering industry.”
"The sea is ours": coastal-free Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a sailed naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean-blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover."
In a coastless Bolivia, the memories of a lost coast, taken by Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict for resources, are still alive, and there is a strong desire to revive the waves of the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps the ones that have gained momentum in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, which concludes five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the ball, which is infusing people with a spirit of belonging and peace, who are looking forward to the outcome in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice on screens, hoping that the Hague Court will stand for Bolivia and that Chile will be forced to sit at the negotiating table after decades of rhapsodical attitudes to give Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial fight to be re-elected next year, has a lot to lose with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not rule in favour of Bolivia, and it would not change the situation much if it were to do so in favour of Bolivia.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to judge Chilean territories, and it has also stated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice was delivered just six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the past four years have not only not helped Bolivia's case, but have even brought it back.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Zárate said.
Because of Morales's hostile rhetoric, the Chileans' remaining goodwill has disappeared.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees with the statement that the court decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in its relationship with Chile” and “a chance for both of them to come out well of the end of 139 years of strife,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, had used the naval debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he said.
“Judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the summit in Singapore.
The remark was made when it appeared that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had succeeded in restarting stalled nuclear talks more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said it was a “desire” to believe that continued sanctions and American obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean War would ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is hesitant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang’s commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the huge headgears that will soon appear in high-end stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the day completely, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of unusually oversized headwear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above-mentioned fashion designers also put their attention-grabbing works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with a feather-like, wide flange, and almost completely absorbed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories were watermelon jewels, a wizard’s base, and even a pineapple, which weren’t really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than of haute couture.
One of them looked like a diving mask, complete with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a melting cone of ice cream.
If you like these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
According to the predictions of style analysts, the huge caps may already be on their way to high-end clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the trail trail trailed by "La Bomba", a 60 cm wide straw hat that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the little-practical hat that conquered social media showed another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the bathing suit model that held it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated with raffia bojs and a white leather handle on the top – was one of the highlights of the La Riviera collection of spring/summer 2019 by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in high-end clothing stores next summer. The designer has created such an elementary effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the existing demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have traditionally provided excellent education. Looking at the recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed by 2018, which is further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their positions as citizens of the world.
In an education sector where it is possible to design and implement customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, they come to their heads.
But if you speak in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have achieved the best results from foreign languages.
Sixty-eight per cent of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher grade A (more than 85 per cent).
Based on data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of students received a higher grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved a grade in Mandarin.
These findings also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent and non-independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17% of employers believe that filling vacancies is difficult because of a lack of language skills.
This shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As more and more workplaces require knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will gain a lifelong lasting knowledge from which you will gain a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual candidate.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15%) of respondents.
This is why it is important to focus on the language education of children.
Speaking several languages, especially those of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children to help them apply for important jobs as adults.
Every school in Scotland will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of major importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you will be able to learn more than one language at independent schools and will be trained by educators who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that equips and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It’s not hard to notice that in today’s global business environment, languages continue to be vital to a country’s future, and education should reflect that.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as an “international communication skill”.
Independent schools offer young people in Scotland the opportunity of choice, diverse and high-quality education.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans won’t have to wait long to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season Sunday opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will be on the track is still in question.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to be in the pre-season to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will start a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of Trump’s five announcements next week, including stops like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his candidate for the vacant seat in the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to raise supporters for the upcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump’s West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you follow it online?
Trump’s speech in West Virginia will begin at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can be watched online via YouTube.
Trump is also likely to be involved in his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing this week, which proved particularly tense in the light of the allegations of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s confirmation vote has been suspended for a maximum of a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary purpose of the sudden proliferation of events is to help the Republicans in the run-up to the November elections.
Trump’s campaign advisor said the five events next week will be “to activate voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“To have the control of Congress in his hands is so critical to his political plans that the president will visit as many states as possible. We are looking forward to a busy campaign period,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The event, scheduled for tonight at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, “will bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and could even be in Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favorable position according to surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to intervene personally to get better in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team fights full-shoulder ahead of Sunday singles to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup was in great need.
The swinging pendulum of luck and momentum is a fairly airy sport concept, yet every player believes in it, mostly in tournaments like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead, and they only have four more advantages, so we can say we have the ball," said Jordan Spieth, who walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and there are twelve more to go.
The Americans, as Spieth tells them, feel that they have finally got a little bit of back-wind and can draw encouragement from many things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
Bayer's cries of victory became louder as he progressed with the lap, scored and equalized by a critical roll in the fourth match, with him and Thomas in double down after two.
His deciding roll of the match at hole 15 produced a similar shout of joy, a kind that can convince the spectator that for the American team everything is not yet lost.
“All you have to do is dig deep into yourself and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what’s waiting for the players.
18 holes for a chance to leave a trail.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair in the Ryder Cup, scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
The strange, but adorable pair of Europe brought four out of four, and they seem to be unable to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only team not to perform above par on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning, they performed similarly.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and the crowd that supports them, they have become the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure Europe’s victory at Le Golf National at sunset than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win one at a time in different holes.
However, it is too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio García, the morning four hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
Spaniards and Swedes once scored one and twice two punches above par in the first nine holes, pushing them into a tide they had no chance of climbing out of.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your pit.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely entertaining to watch in close proximity thanks to the interactions between the two. You can watch who gives what advice, what does not give and how the strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and started the last day with a significant advantage, but this section 4 showed that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them were lacking, especially on the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe has a good start to the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race, winning two victories against infirm Tiger Woods, bringing the gap to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, which is trying to reclaim the trophy that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning’s four-ball games, winning the series 3-1.
America showed greater resistance in the fours, bringing two games, but still they couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team would have to score eight points out of 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known after a sensational weekend as "Molliwood", are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After defeating Woods-Patrick Reed in the four-ball team, they played a great team game to beat unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau for a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes even sparked his talent, but in 29 games he lost 19 of the four-ballers and four-ballers, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning’s four-ball game, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world leader and third.
However, Europe did not succeed on this pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
They won a painful 2&1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball team, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-ball team by 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to come back from a four-point draw in individual races, although one draw is enough for Furyk's championship team to keep the trophy.
However, having only managed to be second best for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems rather unrealistic.
There is no way North Korea will resign unilaterally if it doesn’t trust its negotiating partner.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions has only increased mistrust of the United States, and there is no way the country will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant and generous steps” last year, including halting nuclear and missile testing, closure of nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, we don’t see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
“Without trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and there is no way in these circumstances that we will be unilaterally and first to resign.”
While Ri reaffirmed North Korea’s disappointment at Washington’s resistance to the idea of “phased” nuclear disarmament, which would be expected to reward North Korea for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed meaningful because he did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president in power and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s integrity.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States is of the opinion that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not given in to tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“America is insisting that we start with nuclear disarmament, and it is increasing the pressure with sanctions to force its will on us, and it is protesting that the end of the war can be declared,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of those who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-remitting sanctions will only increase our suspicion.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the U.S. president spoke specifically at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed that three meetings had taken place between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jein in the past five months, adding: “If the country involved in the nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States of America, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after Trump, the “evil president,” called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, overwhelmed Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain until North Korea implemented nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit, meaning “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the actions taken so far.
In contrast, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must be adhered to scrupulously until we have achieved an actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riv during the UN General Assembly recess and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go very well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands” hours later.
At a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the U.S. took “appropriate action.”
According to Mun, the “suitable steps” mentioned by Kim would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the steps that could lead to the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to rest well.
Harvard University’s new subject this year has encouraged students to sleep more, fighting against the increasingly macho culture of caffeinated all-night learning.
One academic concluded that students at the number one university in the world are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and is practicing as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was inspired to develop the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I just facing this as a senior?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, will show students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to start the course because students were found extremely sleepy during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive exercises.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by insomnia, and why bedtime routine is important.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university’s area with interactive icons will be presented to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that we are not going to change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to this knowledge – just as they have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture continues to flourish in which it is an accomplishment to learn one night at a time, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students lead to the growing problem of sleeplessness.
Adequate and high-quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” in combating stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects against obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starving mode and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he took a course at Harvard as a first-time professor.
He said that those who heard him there had opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate a university-level training.
He hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training program before they enter the competitive sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to go to bed, wake up to wake up, and get acquainted with the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electrical screens and LED light sources, which can easily drive them out of the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard’s men and scores
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb slipped Steven Gerrard's team into a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibroxers attempted to win their first off-road victory after a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard lost Gary Holt in his managerial 18 games so far, lagging eight points behind the runner-up of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half, and the unmotivated Rangers team was not even close to equalizing.
While the Rangers slipped down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, lagging behind Hibernian simply because of the difference in goals.
In addition, the Rangers may face further difficulties after the coastline marker Calum Spence was given medical attention due to a likely object thrown from the guests' stands.
Gerrard also changed the team that got into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup by sweeping Ayr.
Holt was on the pitch with the same eleven people at Livingston who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to see his perfect team choke his opponent’s game wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led in possession of the ball, Livingston took more of what he got.
They could have scored a goal in the first two minutes when Menga first pushed Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the zigzag.
A low free kick by Keaghan Jacobs landed with team captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the goal.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to fire two shots at the first half goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute was against the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers once again missed a zigzag coerced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball into Scott Robinson, who was great at finding Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately affected the game when he taunted the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who brought an impressive shape, blocked it in time.
Livingston continued to be able to play the game that was right for him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have forged a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and slammed Jacobs' position before Lithgow missed a corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers replacement, attempted to win another eleven when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson was still unconvinced.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A passage from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago now... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could lead to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter has been one of the basic tools of science ever since, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has also become a part of pop culture:
The man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. It can be used to look for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on this headphone, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted because of the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Listen, it's bouncing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues to exist.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” and Destroy Abnormal Cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment trains the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
This allows them to "see" the protein that accompanies many types of cancer. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has produced promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is a common accompaniment to several types of cancer; and then transplanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers,” Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, based on stimulating immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has already been successfully used in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West’s MAGA-cap SNL performance culminated in a slanderous tyranny in support of Trump.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was whistled in Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent statement in praise of US President Donald Trump, and then announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, in his Make America Great Again cap, he began to speak against the Democrats and once again emphasized his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, he asks, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL's show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh taunted his testimony before the Senate Justice Committee about the allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's sermon was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading it.
West even complained to the audience that he was being harassed behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out in that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And they said I was in the sinking place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see a sunk place? I’ll put on my Superman cape because it means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try with love.”
His expressions were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and the SNL characters were apparently embarrassed, according to an eyewitness who told Variety: “The whole studio was wrapped up in silence.”
West was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West raised several questions when he performed the song I Love It, dressed in Perrier glass.
Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING ME WITH THE BULL.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply "herself, and that's great."
“But I have decided I will NOT reward someone (by buying their music or fashion items or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe owns and spreads an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is "the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His rapper companion Snoop Dogg also adopted the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabber accused of attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, he often grabs a sword.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, highlighting that seeing such heroes often makes little boys feel that hard action is needed to win respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old colleague, Rose Leslie, said she thought it was very important to fix the problem.
“I’m personally deeply concerned about this matter – how has the portrayal of masculinity been so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem we’re facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculinity, as shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing his thought, he added: “What is born of us, and what is learned?
What do the streets and TV tell young boys that makes them feel like this is the only way they can be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
“There’s something wrong with young men.”
Kit said in an interview that after the series' summer season ends, he will not appear in the Game of Thrones series or sequels because he is "tired of the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a producer and his robber brother.
The actor said the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he met while making the series.
"I met my wife on set, so I owe my future family and the life I have before me to the show," Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new patients in China increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, this represents more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
It is a change from the previous ones that a significant majority of newly infected people contract the disease sexually.
The disease has spread rapidly through transfusions of infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of such cases had since fallen to nearly zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman because of the country’s conservative values.
In many cases, the disease spreads in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of a program to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her crew leaked Republican senators’ data and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Democratic congresswoman in Los Angeles said the allegations were spread by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more vile lies," Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on the internet on Thursday. The publisher's identity is unknown, but it is certain that they were posted from the Capitol Hill during the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment hearing in the Senate.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP address was linked to Waters's office, and they also released data about a member of Waters' crew.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters said.
– My staff members are not responsible for any leakage of information. However, their rights to anonymity, privacy and security have been violated as a result of fraudulent and lying accusations.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars.”
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It seems that Waters does not have the temperament to hold the office.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't react angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You need to stay calm and calm.”
Waters compared his reaction to what appeared to be the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to Democratic criticism, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities” of the false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally responsible for all acts that endanger or harm any member of my staff,” Waters said.
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzed spy comedy
It has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and the action-comedy/parody franchise under the name Johnny English is no exception, the first part of which, Johnny English, was released in 2003, and the second part, Johnny English reloaded, was released in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation become the sarcastic, self-parodying satires in which we ridicule our own obvious paralysis?
What’s certain is that Johnny English, with his gummy face and incompetent eyes, had enough ammunition to make another comeback – it’s clear from his name that this comic character was created to be laughed at by crowds in the cinemas of the world’s non-English-speaking countries.
Johnny English, of course, is a cranky secret agent who thinks he’s charming with his bizarre manners, reminding him a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed with a single keystroke to the headline of The Wheel of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler who Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comic vein is well-dominated in the film, but the film’s humor doesn’t really work, and it seems superfluous, because nowadays “serious” franchises like James Bond movies and the Mission Impossible series also boldly use the tool of humor.
Feeling that the film’s humor is more aimed at children, and for me Johnny English’s crazy, misguided adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network’s top-secret online network and revealed the identities of all British agents to the greatest horror of on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got one such small role in the film.
This could be the last nail in the coffin of a self-righteous and divisive prime minister whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since the identity of all active agents has been revealed, he has to put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent, of course, is Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in a prestigious school since his retirement, but he teaches the kids to spy – and there are funny scenes here, of course, while explaining the basics of spying in an English “Rock School” way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets again at the emergency briefing with his former hard-hit gunbearer, Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Since then, Bough has been married to the captain of a submarine, who is always mouth-to-ear – played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined to play a much better role.
So Batman and Robin, a dumb-ass duo from His Majesty's National Security Service, returns to action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly entangled by a charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta and he is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, then smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in a mess, and English unleashes hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end, but no matter how cheerful and twisted it is, it may give the impression of a children’s movie a little too much.
The end result is mediocre.
As with all the Johnny English films, the question has arisen: could the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day working week while paying British workers a five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan to introduce a four-day working week, with workers working for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that company executives can give employees extra days off as a result of increased revenue.
According to the plan, employees would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic program, which aims to tilt the balance language on the side of the workers in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party’s program to tilt the balance to the workers in the economy, and also fits into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned for a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution affecting the economy at last week’s Labour conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless directors” and “beneficiaries” of corporations.
If the shadow finance minister’s plans were implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not be able to get their full profits back, because a Labour government would make “deductions” as a punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to include workers on the board of directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares in private-sector companies to employees, who would then earn <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have revealed in 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election as supreme judge will be held at least a week later than originally scheduled.
In an interview on 60 Minutes Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“That’s what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case exploded, after the accusations came out, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
His response was strong and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete-proof.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take extremely serious accusations to make me change my mind,” Graham said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has strongly denied the allegations," Graham said.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford justify the accusations.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will be revealed.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and have you managed to mitigate poverty?
On Saturday, the annual New York City Music Festival, the Global Citizen Festival, begins. World stars perform at the festival to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held for the seventh time, with tens of thousands expected to fill the Great Lawn of Central Park, where participants will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes’ performance, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, which is run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert are available to those (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or “activities” such as volunteering, sending an email to a senior politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity to raise awareness of the goal of the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen really been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clicktivism” where people feel they have contributed substantially to a case by signing an online petition or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by project sponsors, serving a variety of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped global leaders allocate <0x24>37 billion to anti-poverty policies and commitments that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and announcements came from their actions, of which <0x24>10 billion had already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors to “help children reach their full potential.” The organization pledged Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition to the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK for more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government allocated funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website is: “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?”
The Global Citizen replies: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes stalled and sometimes failed.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because together we are stronger.”
Among others, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year’s New York event, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
Home Secretary: US would use naval “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary," Washington would even deploy the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke quoted the Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke said Russia’s active presence in Syria, especially in Russia’s operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, was a pretext for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they are doing in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And the Home Secretary says there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America and its navy are able to ensure that the sea routes are open, and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy cannot enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the event to the participants of the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be economically penalized in roughly the same way: by using existing energy sources and by introducing new ones," Zinke said, calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy," pointing out the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why top officials in the Trump administration, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to step back from the “incorrect” pipeline project called North Stream 2, which, if implemented, would make Germany a “host” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so vehemently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans went backwards as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third country interferes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for presidency in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she was “seriously considering” running for the presidency.
Warren confirmed at a meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and put right a badly functioning government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he thought he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has outspokenly criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, a majority of Warren’s Massachusetts voters don’t believe Warren should run for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Analysis and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren “have a good chance” that the senator shouldn’t run for the presidency, while
32% support Warren's candidacy.
According to the poll, Deval Patrick’s former presidential candidate would be supported by a majority, 38%, and 48% opposed.
In the 2020 presidential election, high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont were mentioned.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will decide whether to run by January.
Sarah Palin refers to Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after signing up in September
Arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he returned home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going home with,” said Sarah Palin at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of his son "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, "returned transformed, hardened, and constantly wondered if he had due respect for the service that his comrades, pilots, and all the other members of the army had done for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. A spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, said that Track Palin had also reportedly committed domestic violence in a gun and drunken state.
18 member states and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 member states and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of the new U.S. refugee policy that excludes refugees fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker attacking the policy in court, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner in the Grace vs. Sessions case, initiated by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
The plaintiff alleges that she was abused by her partner and her “sons of a violent gang,” but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The woman is being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications to the United States come from, as these countries are a constant source of crime gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to allow undocumented immigrants to file asylum applications on the basis of domestic violence.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “will disregard decades of state, federal and international law.”
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter said.
The prosecutors also stated in the letter that the policy of rejecting immigration is detrimental to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest-level jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a specific social group, persecution on the basis of political convictions, or a well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said at the announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the problems people face every day around the world, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, the rescue teams are racing against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while she is reassuring her feverish little boy in an evacuation center in the devastated Palu.
Ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water."
Some residents returned to their homes to save what could still be saved from the wet.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are unable to provide care.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulders, were taken to the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside the hospital building due to high-strength aftershocks.
The man's eyes were filled with tears when he recalled how the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which his wife and daughter were staying, trembled in the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m stuck in the collapsed walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Propaganda Ads
The U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited his ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register last Wednesday – the most-selling newspaper in Iowa – while accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, according to some U.S. officials who told Reuters, marks a new stage in Washington’s increasingly strong action against China, aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, with new tariffs being imposed on each other’s imports.
According to experts from the US and China, the tariffs imposed by the Chinese in response to the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for several terms, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses because the state of Iowa was exporting a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is still infuriating our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the much-loved American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if you go to a Beijing newspaper store, you will find hardly any critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all accurately reflect the different, differing opinions of the Chinese people on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish” his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans may alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say it may turn out that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of allegations of sexual harassment, losing support, especially for female voters, before the mid-term elections.
The incident aroused fierce emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be reversed, according to Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow, not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, a Washington-based newspaper.
According to the Mic report, on Friday morning, some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted, “November is approaching!” because the Republican-controlled Justice Committee, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, decided not to revoke Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“There will be an amazing leap in democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Many people say it’s already been very high, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban insecure female voters and young people (aged 18-29), who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go out to vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, analysts had assumed that he could retaliate against the Republicans if he continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party has fallen to a rough ground,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote and the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it’s also about how Republicans handled the case and how they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Priorities for Democrats.
However, it seems that Americans are quite divided as to whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony completely or more, and 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying about his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that Ford was lying about him.
Under Flake’s motion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as is another of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Deborah Ramirez.
A week ago, Ford swore in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was abusing him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s, when they were both studying at Yale.
World Wide Web Inventor Wants to Launch a New Internet to Defy Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “take control of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” also known as POD.
This can include lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data warehouse is that the user can decide who has access to his or her data entirely.
The company calls this the “execution of the right of individuals to self-determination over data”.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company’s mission is to provide the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team won’t ask Facebook and Google if they’re going to introduce the technology that’s going to change the company’s business models overnight.”
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important opinion-former in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the World Wide Web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann Viktoria-Crossed Pastor of World War I celebrated
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victorian Cross is celebrated in his hometown 100 years after his heroic act in World War I.
Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal during the attacks at Bellenglise and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew that he had earned the highest honour in the British Armed Forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically important" that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning act.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin, “amid thick fog and heated gun and machine gun fire.”
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "exceptional heroism," took the lead in the battalion, then he himself stormed a camp cannon detachment, destroying its three members.
Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never do what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72.
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, wreathed the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to play a role at the ceremony, adding: “The bravery of a true hero is evidenced by the number of people who later pay respect to him.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and the broadcast is canceled.
The San José show featured 13 matches, six of which were broadcast live at night on Channel 5 in the UK as part of the main competition.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, Peppa Pig was added to the show to the great surprise of the British spectators.
This was displeased by many who stayed up until the morning due to this very clash.
Instead of the MMA game, one fan called the children’s cartoon “some kind of sick joke” on Twitter.
“Under state regulations, such content is no longer broadcast at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of communications and marketing.
“Yes, it’s Peppa, the pig time.”
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would reschedule the show in the future to include UK viewers.
"I think we can solve it by repeating it," Coker said.
“But since it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, we can’t fix the situation until Sunday at our time, which is already Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we're talking about, we're dealing with a legal problem.
But I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
“Instead of the previous six, there will only be five games in the program – we really wanted to please the viewers, but we made a mistake.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone at a young age because of his sexual orientation, but he was motivated to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she stood up for gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he is far less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-lived show, missed several months due to illness.
Invited by Daley on Laverne's first show as a "shipwreck," he said that when he was young, he felt "less" than anyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
“To this day, it’s the feeling of inferiority and difference that gives me the endurance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of her participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, has asked governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke in the case because he felt fortunate to live his life openly without negative consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter were married last year, and he said the age difference was never a problem between them.
“If you’re going through so much when you’re young,” he said, “you played your first Olympics at the age of 14 and your father died of cancer three years later,” then it’s hard to find someone in your own age who’s had such extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley's own admissions, completely upset his attitude towards the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are things more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child was named after Daley’s father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't answer him, 'Dad, you're not going to be in the front row,'" he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father was invulnerable,” she said.
The following year, Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
Heather's "Small Proud" (Pride) helped her to prepare for the Olympics, and she still gets goosebumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and took off on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson can set a record for his 47th match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his shape if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson played the record-breaking 12th time in a biennial event, but was sent to the bench by team captain Jim Furyk due to his performance in four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of getting five victories in major tournaments at the center of events, as so many times when the United States had to fight for victory, he now supports his team in one half of the day and spends the other half practicing on the pitch trying to fix the mistakes that weaken his game.
At the top of his career, he was never one of the most punctual bats, so the 48-year-old player doesn’t really fit into the narrow court of Le Golf National, where the high grass causes a very high price to be paid for the wrong bats.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has won all four of his games with Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans starting with a four-point draw before 12 individual matches start strong, Mickelson’s match can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in the development of today. He patted my back, embraced me and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn't want him to play two games.
I was planning more, but in the given situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break the record for Nick Faldo, who has never played more games in the Ryder Cup.
This will end a series in the Ryder Cup that is far behind the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson won 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk said the veteran's presence would not bring any tangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, he's a great team member," he said.
“I think the younger players enjoyed playing against him, too, and it’s good to see that.
Its presence goes beyond the strict sense of play.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if you get a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn your back on him.
The Danish player first made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage over the Americans, and in the end they were just able to keep a hairy advantage to win a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“We always have to remind ourselves that despite our great lead at Valderrama, we only won by a hair and we had a big lead at Brookline, where we finally lost,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said after winning the 2018 class on Friday 5–3 and yesterday, leading 10–6 at Le Golf National.
“It’s enough to think about the races of the previous years and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
Tomorrow, you'll have to play with all your might.
So come on, and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
“As I said before, I’m mostly dealing with the 12 players on our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happen to be among the biggest players in the world.”
Proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Then it all depends on individual achievements, which is completely different from team play.
It feels great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out individually, it turns out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
This is what players need to understand so that they can make the best of themselves on the pitch tomorrow.
They will have to get rid of their partner, who will also have to do his best."
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk is confident that his players perform better individually than in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day revivals: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, then he was on the losing side after the European team’s “medinah miracle” accomplishment.
"I remember every damn word," he said when asked about how he encouraged the players before the last day, in 1999.
“We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we’re doing the best with a start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one team really pushes into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent’s players in the middle of the game.
That’s why we’ve ranked our players and prepared them to do a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of taking the lead in the effort to reverse the position, playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I chose this order because I think that’s how the picture works from beginning to end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added to the individual line-up.
Germany's newest warship is deferred
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it is expected to remain in service at least until next year.
The inauguration of the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the "Rheinland-Palatinate", was postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit weekly reported citing an army spokesman.
The ship was initially scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but continued delays made it very difficult for the large-scale project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class ageing frigates.
It is believed to have a high-powered cannon, as well as various anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and camouflage technology, including a signal damper that reduces the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the ports.
However, due to the ongoing slippage of the project, these high-tech warships, which could make Germany feel its power overseas, may become obsolete as soon as they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The hard-hitting F125 frigate made the headline last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the inauguration of the vessel and sent it back to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited several critical "software and hardware bugs" that make the warship useless in a combat operation.
Software deficiencies are a major problem, with only 120 sailors serving on the Baden-Württemberg-class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later.
The 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Palatinate” is said to be twice as heavy as the German-built ships of a similar class in World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astounding <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), while the initial draft was estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany’s sea presence is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the National Defense Committee of the German parliament, recently admitted that the navy was “becoming out of ships in apt condition.”
In the meantime, according to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-igniting process, as old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace those who have fallen out.
He was concerned that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret lives of bats
A new study is underway on a Scottish Highlands estate to find out how bats exploit the characteristics of the landscape while hunting.
The researchers hope that the findings will provide new information on the behavior of single-flying mammals, which may also benefit future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats as well as brown long-eared bats and aquatic bats at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points in the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the recordings can be used to determine the frequency of bat tones and what the species is doing.
The researchers will also create a habitat map and report that will help determine in detail how the behaviour of the animals depends on the landscape.
NTS Nature Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for bats and what species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow design, and how best to conserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and land development work disrupts the animals’ sleeping quarters and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are out-of-door fly papers, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not completely blind.
But because of their nocturnal predatory nature, they rely more on their hearing than on their sight when hunting prey.
Their sophisticated technique, based on the reflection of ultrasound, allows them to determine the exact position of insects, as well as the landmarks that come in their way.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep site surveys, and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
"There's a great place for bats in Threave," he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else necessary for a good living space.
But we don’t know a lot about bats yet, and thanks to the work we’ve done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also stressed the importance of making sure that bats live there before renovating buildings, as the destruction of a single colony could result in the death of 400 females and juveniles, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and their destruction, harassment and disturbance of their habitat is prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for help from the public.
“There is still a lot we don’t know about bats, and we don’t know much about the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, his lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news” and said others wanted to use his name to “get in the public eye.”
The soccer lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese squad member and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
She said the athlete paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations came to light, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142-million-strong fan base on Instagram Live that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
“The things that have been told about me today are all lies,” the five-time gold ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get in the public eye.
That happens.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Due to the allegations, which have been described as “an unacceptable suspicion that violates privacy,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages “to the extent of the moral damage caused, to the extent of the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights committed in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man sexually raped the woman, according to documents filed with the District Attorney's Office in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent good boy" except for "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had had sexual relations with the woman, but said it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had a medical examination of her injuries carried out in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the incident in question continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was in the process of transferring from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he was bought by Italian giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will “peace forever” for the loss of automakers
The UK will regret it forever if it loses its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK is “concerned” by a statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car manufacturer will be forced to temporarily shut down production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses due to delays at the borders.
The Burnaston plant, which produced the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at the plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW said it would close its Miniket plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Automakers are most concerned about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is “on time” with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and other EU countries.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, disruptions at the borders could lead to production delays and spare parts shortages, according to industry representatives.
Toyota said it would be impossible to store more than one day’s spare parts at its plant in Derbyshire and that production would have to be stopped.
Clark said his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was “precisely designed to avoid delayed checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement, and we want the best possible terms and conditions to be able to enjoy not only the fruits of our current successes, but also new opportunities,” he said in a statement on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain at the moment.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would last, but warned that the aggregation of costs could lead to a long-term loss of competitiveness, which could ultimately result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is now representing the Unite trade union, unionists are becoming increasingly concerned: “In my experience, jobs lost at this time will never be recovered.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, the White House said.
"One more week could be postponed" for a major meeting between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump as the dispute over the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who will investigate Russian influence in the elections, possible ties between Trump’s advisors and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
Washington has been speculating for months whether Trump will eventually dismiss the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
According to the New York Times this month, Rosenstein has considered coming to the meeting wired to record a conversation with the president, and the question has been raised as to whether it would be possible to replace Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what had been said.
However, he visited the White House on Monday, and rumours spread that he would file for resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who had appeared before the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “not like” to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid collision with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, also testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a date yet, we can even set it this week, but in the light of the Supreme Court cases, I see a chance for another one-week postponement.
We'll find out soon, and I'll, as always, notify the press."
Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace also asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not due to the aversion to the “sensational” behavior of television reporters, but he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they are indeed sensationalists.”
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and press representatives would take place more often.
“The president gives more question-and-answer interviews than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without supporting the allegation: “We looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask its questions directly to the President of the United States, light years are better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, and in the last few weeks there have been many such occasions, so instead of the White House press conferences, you can talk to the President of the United States in person."
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences held alone are quite rare.
The reason, perhaps, can be deduced from what happened this week, when the president in New York produced an unusual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
The head of the health ministry wrote to NHS Scotland’s EU workers about concerns about Brexit
In a letter, the head of the health ministry expressed his gratitude to the Scottish NHS’s employees from European Union countries, stressing that he hopes they will remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent the letter less than six months before the expected withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens working in a decentralised public service in relation to their applications for established status.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the European Union continued, and a decision is expected to be taken in the autumn.
The UK government has also begun preparing a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a disturbing time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Employees from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to the Healthcare Department, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home, and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent urgent surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He walked to the coastline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and medical staff members first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie had gone through surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he “does not yet know more details about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie spends his first season with the Tennessee State team, where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful fittings before leaving the circuit, so he is now at 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on real estate purchased in the UK
Under Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on real estate purchased in the UK, and the surplus revenue will be used to support homeless people.
This move would neutralize Corbyn’s success among young voters
The tax increase is aimed at those who do not tax in the UK.
According to the State Treasury, this would mean annual revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on real estate purchased in the UK, and the surplus revenue will be used to support homeless people, Theresa May is preparing to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely aimed at offsetting Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase will affect individuals and companies who do not tax in the UK, and the extra revenue will be used to fight homelessness.
The surcharge to be added to the current levy, which is to be calculated in addition to the higher levy on second dwellings and real estate purchased for spending purposes two years ago, may reach up to three per cent.
The State Treasury expects annual revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK citizens, causing a significant price increase, which makes the situation for first-time home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country’s wealthy districts have become “spirit cities”, especially in the capital, as there are many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a tax cut to help young people who were about to wait for their first home.
He personally holds construction companies responsible for keeping property prices high, who have become a habit of buying up land and leaving it to waste. He asked May to abolish quotas on affordable houses and do something about the “home market shame” that has emerged in the country.
Corbyn has announced a series of remarkable proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and the elimination of evictions without good reason.
In addition, it would give the councils more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to devote my Prime Ministership to the restoration of the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
The real estate market situation needs to be resolved.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country, as well as companies with foreign interests, to buy real estate as easily as hard-working British citizens.
Dreams of living in one’s own home have become almost unattainable for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible.”
Jack Ross: "I want to be the manager of the Scottish team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his “most important desire” was to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first league, only three points behind the first place.
He moved his headquarters to the Stadium of Light after successfully returning his team to the Scottish Premier League in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserve," Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I watched the Scottish team play a lot in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
Now, however, I have only a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not worried about having to follow in the footsteps of such great names, and previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“At the moment, I’m measuring my success by whether I can get the team back into the first division.
“If you consider the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly its place in the first league,” he said.
“It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only consider my activities here a success if I can bring the club back.”
Ross’ managerial career began just three years ago, after working as a deputy coach for Dumbarton for a while, as well as spending 15 months on the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Aolla recover after the team dropped back into the third division, and with St. Mirren, who was on the verge of elimination, he won the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he has ever felt in his career as a player, whether with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said, recalling his time as a coach for Alloa.
“I definitely thought management was better for me than being a player.
That sounds strange, because I did it well, I lived it quite well, I even had some really memorable moments.
The lives of the players are sometimes very difficult.
We have a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in managing, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel the best in my skin all my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, beer falls best on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has seen a significant increase in the sales of difficult pubs in England, but the chains of restaurants are still under a lot of pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consulting company that compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the sunny season and Britain’s longer-than-expected World Cup performance, the trend of the previous month, when pubs experienced 2.8% revenue growth, continued in July, except that restaurants experienced even greater declines.
Restaurant revenues declined by 1.8% in June and worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that sold mostly alcohol were the best performers, and the increase was even greater than the drop-outs in restaurants.
Pubs that prefer to serve food were also uncomfortably affected by the lasting sunshine, though not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
People seem to be more inclined to drink at this time.
Revenue from drinks in corporate pubs and bars increased by 6.6% this month, and revenue from food fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for the leisure and catering industry, says: “These results follow the trend that has been evolving since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major community and sporting events, continue to be the main source of revenue for the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual 4.8% fall in revenue can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only be time to see if the milder weather in August will bring relief in this area.”
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of new brands.

One in five children have a social media account that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children (even at age 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta subsites” is growing
Fear of sharing sexual content increases as a result of the news
20% of students said they have a “main” account that their parents can see
One in five children (even at the age of 11) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta fake accounts” referring to the Instagram photo sharing site is growing rapidly.
The fear of sharing sexual content is increasing.
Twenty percent of students said they have an impeccable “main” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a profile of a teenager who said, “Violate me.”
According to a study by Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of Digital Awareness UK and independent school directors, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual board meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete and chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade would be of invaluable help to decision-makers in the sport.
“Eilidh has a great deal of respect in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will contribute to the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I was delighted to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope to be able to really help the Scottish managers.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals were won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 m and 400 m, but he was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain disorder.
He tweeted, “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time it would be decided if I was going to recover at all.
With a hard work, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I am going to agility training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Mothers like cows share the online community with a breast pump advertisement
There was a heated online debate about the ad of a breast pump company comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first quiet, wearable breast pump” and advertised their product in an ironic commercial evoking music videos that showed the freedom it gives mothers who are milking their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stable full of straw, while the lyrics in the background are: "Yes, I milk myself, I don't have a dick" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
And the chorus reads, “I pump, I pump, so that the child eats big, I pump, I pump, I milk the girls.”
An advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page quickly became the subject of online debate.
The video received 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed responses. Many people say that the advertising makes fun of the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
Advertise the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken away from them within days,” one of the commentators recalls.
Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary said: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the calf as well.
But why not use them to sell breast pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “Completely insensitive advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “horribly funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it again.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commentator says: “This is a funny ad for mothers milking their milk at work or in a toilet, who feel like ‘cows’ because of it.
It does not glorify or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that the discreet breast pump was in their bra all the time while they were dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast pumps sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires or tubes, and can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their baby in their hands, or even move out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communications director, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallel between milking women and milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps, and in a funny way to give an idea of how our breast pump gives you a sense of freedom compared to that.”
It's not the first time Elvie's breast pump has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two stepped on the runway wearing Marta Jakubowski’s dress while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children’s migrants in detention has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that the Trump administration’s brutal rhetoric and actions so far make it harder to find hosting homes for them.
The hosts themselves are typically illegal immigrants, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be impaired if they applied to receive children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that host parents and adults living with them in the same household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs Enforcement official, admitted in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied to host unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Eighty percent of the host applicants and the people living with them are illegally in the country, and a significant proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the trial of children, new rules have been introduced that require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, instead of 60 days, social workers say.
Many check in through videoconferencing calls in court instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge fails to grant legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and people working in the system have reported that the longer detention takes, the more nervous and depressed the children become, and the more likely there are violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
According to rights defenders, these risks are only compounded by a larger facility, like the one in Tornillo, where the number of children makes it harder to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they do not give the children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they are moved to such facilities, they will be exposed to even greater trauma.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupying forces"
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes despite the civil war that has ravaged the country for eight years.
Moualem, who also held the position of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had entered Syria illegally, citing the fight against terrorism, and would be treated “as such.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes, would soon end.
He declared that Damascus “continues its holy fight to clear the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
There are 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, most of whom are training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions were right for their return, and that only “some Western countries” would provoke “irrational fears,” deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help people return home,” he said.
“They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone around the rebels’ last big citadel, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a widespread attack on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement sets “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including the Al-Nusra Front, which “must be rooted out.”
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of representatives from the government and the opposition will soon be convened to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the elections.
According to Moualem, the participation of the Syrian government in the committee is acceptable, for example, only “revision of certain articles of the current constitution” and warns all external actors against interference in the process.
That’s why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020 unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and a prosecution or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
We can be sure that this will be “the most dramatic presidential final of all time.”
For the time being, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN’s mainstream viewing has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC nearly tripled its viewing to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in mainstream time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most watched cable show with its 3.5 million viewers on the evenings of the major news days.
“It attracts us like fire, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama series “The Appointed Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking cabinet miniature sits in the chair after an attack on the Capitol is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club"
Here’s how you recall a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why," asked Scovell.
“It makes me laugh,” the driver replied.
This is the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like the Roe vs. Wade precedent, whether immigrant families can reunite and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do so that you do not care about these facts.
But it’s no longer part of responsible information when we’ve been staring for six hours at a debate about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” or about Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“Trump’s outfit of incarnated arrogance,” as the Washington Post puts it), or about what it’s like.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'm always going to think about Super Mario from now on.
“It’s a bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “The Rise of the Stars.” Trump’s show keeps changing characters, and new turns come in every day (he goes to N.F.L., praises D. Kim).
If you miss a single episode, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a nice 26 degrees, sunny weather in Kauai, yet he was in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from television as Brett Kavanaugh began hearing on the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
"I remember when we were making those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but they were right.”

Both parties are throwing money into the tightest competitions in the mid-term congressional election
No one is surprised that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties are spending countless amounts of money after two active MPs are struggling for the same seat after the redesign of the congressional districts.
One of the contestants for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb’s opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is now a representative of Pennsylvania’s former 12th district, which overlaps with today’s 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district boundaries had been manipulated to the benefit of Republicans.
The Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) almost bid on each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after he won the March midterm election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by the Republicans for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts say Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador because of China’s support, and then withdrew from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama are already on the side of Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
Donald Trump was in good spirits with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization’s leadership team out of there.
The Department of State has recalled senior staff from U.S. offices in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their “recent decision not to support Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier.
Sanctions were, however, considered only against El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, such as reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have hurt the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which was to be a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence would also speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. deputies returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue any condemnation statements or take any sanctions.
John Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the dispute, which were reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were also backed up by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak only anonymously.
Historical experiences
The next strike could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has obstructed justice in some way... and there are many publicly disclosed facts that point to this.
Mueller’s investigation also allegedly covers whether Trump’s team cooperated with Russia, which attempted to influence the election.
If the Democrats reach the majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who after the voters may have to face the verdict of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertainties, and Trump’s failure is far from inevitable... and so are his European principled friends.
Serious decisions will have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to put Hitler in a coup, only waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
Support was not provided, so the bloodshed of the following years could not be prevented.
At historical turning points like this, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is supervising Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been shaking since last year when, as reported by our newspaper, he suggested recording the conversations with the president and suggested that Trump was unfit for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and, despite a seemingly credible accusation of sexual harassment, he is appointed a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question: will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail at these trials, democracy is facing a long winter.
I hope that will not be the case, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once lived in the building where I was an ambassador.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a swastika-marked table during the Sabbath.
How can I be pessimistic about our future with such a cultural heritage?”

Graham Dorrans with the Rangers is confident before the game against Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against Spain's Villarreal will secure them a place in the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to enter the field due to a knee injury until the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can set more daring goals for themselves.
“It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal,” the 31-year-old said.
“We believed we could score a point and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can’t complain about the draw.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in their last match, but with our fans behind our backs, we’re sure to have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we give our best, we can leave the last season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women worry about not saving enough for old age
The survey participants had precise ideas about what kind of care they wanted for their seniors, but only a small proportion of them spoke to their family members about it.
According to a survey by Nationwide, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouses the expected cost of their care for the elderly.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the issue,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
The following is worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take good care of you if you don’t tell us in time what your needs are.
Together with your counselor and family, choose where and what care you want; these choices have a significant impact on future costs.
Recruit a financial advisor: he or she can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can take the form of a traditional old-age insurance policy, or a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings that can cover expenses, or use your own assets as collateral...if you have enough resources.
Prepare the legal documentation: Thus, the possibility of subsequent litigation is cut off.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person, who will act on your behalf on health issues, supervise your medical care, and make sure that everything happens according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Entrust someone with your finances.
This trustworthy person will make the necessary financial decisions and take care of paying bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
A man has been shot several times in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home after his evening program.

Police described the shooting as a “random act” at around 02:30 local time.
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, but police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake on Friday, followed by a tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu.
The area’s communications network was also damaged, so no news has yet been received from Donggala Governorate, north of Palu, where the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 was the centre.
More than 16,000 people had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of Palu Central Celebes, on the west coast of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of a narrow bay with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Governorate is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the Governorate, a smaller administrative region than the province, was approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit Western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Fire Ring area, so earthquakes are common.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea quake began on the west coast of the Aceh province of North Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing a total of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, killing more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
On the island of Nias, near Sumatra, hundreds of people died.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and a tsunami in its wake killed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: 7.6 earthquake near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an island in the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake hit the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and devastation that arose in its wake evoked the memories of the terrible tsunami of 2004 in many people.
The tsunami did not occur this time, but more than 100 residents were killed under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is an Indonesian island popular with tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed, and thousands of tourists were trapped on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is accused of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence, and resistance to arrest, state police said.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took the woman's phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su prison, a <0x24>500 bail has been imposed on him, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, responding to a question about his guilt, saying he was "no guilt at all."
Palin is charged with three class A offenses, including up to four years in prison and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which could result in a one-day imprisonment and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's got a fight with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of the reporting of the crime, as well as arms possession under alcoholic influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperative, and the number of dead is likely to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake was located near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are several videos on social media about the tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami landed.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
New York federal prosecutors have requested the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City, which has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, was charged with driving a Home Depot truck on a bike trail on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway in October, hitting a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and had “intentional” to inflict injury, according to a petition from the prosecutor’s office in the Southern District of New York.
According to the file submitted, the evidence of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion murder, which until then had been used almost exclusively against organised crime, as well as damage and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack “required significant planning and deliberate intention,” prosecutors say, and Saipov’s actions were described as “terrible, cruel, and inhumane.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern district has been demanding the death penalty for a defendant for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a New York federal case was executed was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple had been convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
During the interviews, he said he was pleased.
Saipov said the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, the indictment says.
According to the police, he asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent of all 22 charges.
David Patton, a state defender representing Saipov, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
“We believe that the actual life imprisonment for a confession would have been more beneficial, and that the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all those involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense officials have asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty for their defendants.
Tory MEP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage said at the Tory conference that he “calls the people’s army to fight.”
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of May’s party colleagues suggested that Farage should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who did not hold any office, told attendees of the Birmingham meeting that the UK would have “left long ago” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
It is a good sign of the pressure within the party on May that the conservative Torys have spoken in another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is striving to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a constant layover between Brexit and the EU.
In spite of the negative reactions, his allies said he was trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party could only choose between his package or “total chaos”.
Bone at a Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull said that the "Chequers Agreement" had to be stopped.
He suggested that Farage should be admitted to the House of Lords and be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have quit by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I stand by Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be dealt with.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to serve others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay.”
The pro-Brexit Tory representative, Andrea Jenkyns, also attended the meeting and said to the journalists: “All I ask of you is, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work on the ground and helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
In a letter to May, he said, “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his chair.”
Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” not to dare to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is at stake now,” he said.
"They want to betray Brexit, and we are here today to send a message that we will not let them do it."
He told the enthusiastic crowd: “I want our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We will call on the people’s army to fight to win Brexit, and we will not rest until we have made the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
In the meantime, the conservatives marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists waved the flag of the “Torys Against Brexit” movement that formed this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's use of security flaws at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, an uninterrupted border crossing and a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland,” he said.
- They're just twisting.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren ‘considers carefully’ to run for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about his future at a West Massachusetts public forum on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing to be re-elected in November against the state’s Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There’s been some speculation that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was his 36th meeting with voters in Holyoke since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he was planning to run in the presidential election.
Warren said the time had come for “women to play a role in Washington in restoring a failed government, including taking a top position.”
A man suspected of shooting Sims in LSU has been arrested
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday announced that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m. East Coast Time.
They released a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the campus area of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that proved fatal," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde intervened in defense of his friend, and that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being on the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge District Police Station.
The grown-up Baton Rouge Sims played 32 games last season, 10 as a beginner, an average of 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to world championship after winning Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play a big role in the race.
Bottas, starting from the pole position, started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first stepped out of the boxing alley and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the midfield, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a close-up action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner curve free after moving twice as a defensive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started at the back of the row and was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then drove most of the race, as he did not change the tyres so that he could quickly finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of fourth place.
At the end of the 44th lap, he reached the boxing alley, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, making Räikkönen fourth.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday after she insisted that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s judiciary committee, but merely pointed out that things in the Senate prove that people are “abominable, abominable, and liars.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days, is when you see the anger when you see people are angry, vile, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“When you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, hold on a second.
No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter leaked in early September. However, Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to treat him confidentially, and I treated him confidentially as he requested."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who remarked at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I’ll tell you what’s going on: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women by claiming that Democrats were using the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by whatever means they use.
“You can see the vileness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, they have to run through to take power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
On Saturday, the Dundee Stars made amends for their defeat in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had a two-goal lead at an early age.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened out to the homeland, and Dwyer re-established the Giants.
Francois Bouchard made up for Dundee's draw, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
Adam Keefe's third Elite League loss in the season was against Dundee 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal was scored in the fourth minute, at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pass, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the twisted opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt's pass was settled by Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants could lead to the break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third of the night.
The home team reorganized their ranks, and Bouchard scored again with a human advantage goal at 27:37.
Cownie's interaction with Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen take the lead to Dundee towards the end of the second trimester for the first time in the game, and then arranged for a victory with his team's fifth goal in the half of the last trimester.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, returned home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to save hundreds of people on the plane from earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero who has been killed while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly hovering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palua.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, now on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were crushed when we heard the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could be thousands, according to the country’s disaster relief agency, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“The number of casualties is likely to increase further as many are trapped under the ruins and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves reaching a height of six metres destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing new bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a real tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the troops of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night on the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN's report.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, killing more than 500 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing in flight crash in lagoon
A recent statement by the airline operating a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing, although it had previously been claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release by Air Niugini, the situation on Sunday afternoon is that a male passenger cannot be accounted for.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to additional information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to hit the sinking plane’s emergency exits by force in the water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, boaters repairing a quay nearby helped rescue the people and took them to shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the past two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor told the prosecutor on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from multiple phones that showed she was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts the man's earlier allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned him.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis “lied because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to the cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio called for a negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip-hop has moved away from its roots in dealing with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to these roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have regained popularity in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is it black again?
New York nanny sues party for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple over their dismissal on grounds of discrimination after the mother complained in a false message that they had succeeded in employing a “black” nanny again.
The couple denies being racist and compare the lawsuit to “extortion.”
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when, in 2016, upon the arrival of the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, on her first day at work, she discovered that the woman was black.
“NEEEEEEEEM, A BLACK AWAY!” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of your husband, you sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who was “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more looking forward to a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day job and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for his dismissal and demanding <0x24>350 a day for the six-month residential work he was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them to stop, you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism that it was reasonable to stop using Maurice because they feared that they could not trust him after he was insulted.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
But would you trust your children with someone who, even if by chance, was rude to them?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on.
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to “extortion,” said his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and that she was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you attack someone like that?
It’s not a good thing to do that,” the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are underway, the public opinion court has swiftly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s publisher feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s quite fun to have this information now that we know how huge Paddington’s success is.”
He said his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he felt inspired to write a children’s book about a toy bear, would not have been resentful if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was bittersweet after his father’s death last year.
He called Paddington "a very important member of their family" and added that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man, he wasn't arrogant at all," he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child carrying something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really our merit.
I think that's how you saw Paddington's success.
Although he created it and emerged from his imagination, he always attributed it to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When she landed, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
“They called me regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter would die in the next two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait for it to be over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn’t leave myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others, who did not care for the trials she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sympathy for them on the plane.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want either parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, a 45-year-old who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook, and her grin stuck on everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that her smile would lift up any place."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was in “very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life on his own, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that this would cause some sort of domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards “so that people can find out that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you have to talk!”
Ms. Humphreys, who for years had lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend, Mark, who was her life partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was completely upset on Christmas Day: when the children opened their presents, she didn’t look them in the eyes and all that.”
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge gap in the family.
He broke our hearts in small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve what he had asked for -- a limited, limited investigation -- we might reach an agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee feared he would "fall into pieces" because of the party's indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The midterm election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not expected to perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their man to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to enroll Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "dissidents" under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents heading for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengsok quoted South Unification Ministry data and said there were 1,127 dissidents last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the North’s dissidents will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents are welcomed by China as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and are often sent back by force.
The North-South relationship, which is still virtually at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, the focus of their talks was the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came in June with a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where broadly agreed on further cooperation on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the American people, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is unthinkable that we should unilaterally disarm our weapons," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' but unfit for Supreme Court
Minority Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, called him a “hysterical” and claimed that his behavior did not fit for work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought unwittingly that if a woman behaved like this at any time, she would be called a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested the rumors that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming, and his voice faded when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character killing,” organized by angry liberals over Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh’s behavior proved he wasn’t fit to work for the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's shut himself out with his statements and his behavior against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable in the event that Kavanaugh occupied the seat and the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I’m saying is that if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s not for the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Capital Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions about the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would alter the Supreme Court's rulings.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court, and he expects us to fly with joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
This is a legitimate outburst, a rage that has accumulated for months and years comes to the surface, and it can't escape without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, is it?”
She told me that she was also crying in anger, but she devised a technique whereby, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
In part, tears are tolerated as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from an early job in a male-dominated office, where once in my angry inertia I began to cry that an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a cool manager I’ve always been afraid of – and took me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've got you upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair at Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to the conclusion that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said laughing to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their backs.
Somebody named her "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder was lagging behind in raising money, so she vowed not to enter the competition unless she raised the <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men <0x24>1,000, but he only got <0x24>250.
“Did you think I’d get a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, as well as frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, and rage about sexism, that his throat was closed.
“You may have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“You might think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
"Crying?"
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening round of the U.S.-China trade war was almost deafening, and although the battle is not yet nearly over, experts say that a break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warnings early this year by levying a tax on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs already affecting <0x24>200 billion worth of goods, virtually taxing half of all goods from China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated, most recently imposing tariffs ranging from 5% to 10% on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to retaliate every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not retreat in the near future.
If he wanted to persuade Washington to retreat, it would mean that he would have to give in to demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, President of China.
Yet, experts say, if Beijing tactics well, U.S. trade war pressure can be beneficial to China in the long run, as it reduces the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could swirl any of the two countries’ economies into an economic turbulence is far more serious than observers have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, Asia Research Assistant at the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return the refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, which was devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said the country’s conditions were improving.
"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the achievements in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normality.
Now all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to flee between terrorism and arbitrary economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The other six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or contributions from countries that supported the uprising will not be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by 16.5:10.5 at the Le Gold National, held outside of Paris.
The U.S. has failed for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the tournament, dropped his punch in the par-3 at the 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in every round, becoming one of the four players who have ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the European team's lowest-ranking player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, by 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost by 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after his European victory.
Jon Rahm defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 single on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods and grown up watching this man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and who is preceded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing result, “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
There was an occasion this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping our team, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
