The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The City Council of Kuopio unanimously approved the association on Monday.
The city council of Juankoski approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal association, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would remain independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the following municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, will meet with his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations on his first major foreign visit since the election victory in May.
Modi’s five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economy.
At the top of the topics are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops are firing on civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political dialogue with the east of its country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tassi news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current positions where Putin said Ukrainian military forces were shooting at civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was surprising that the crowd came early in the evening.
The number of visitors during the two days was as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hip-Hop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be a hip-hop festival, so pop isn’t going to happen,” Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, a law will enter into force restricting the purchase of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Board for permission to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as a precursor to explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration levels are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations in them do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration driving.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
Two rapists in two hotels are awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the High Court of Glasgow.
She is accused of rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman "when she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make her own decision."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November at the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shining - Mario was left in the shadows - Premier League - Evening-Sanomat
Raheem Sterling, just 19, once again showed why he is regarded as the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, which was strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived at Tottenham as a guest.
Super Mario’s debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than during Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his top spot.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and only baited half of his 16 passes to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already made the player a favorite expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers sent Balotelli to Barcelona for the role of Luis Suarez as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team was Raheem Sterling, the middle-field diamond tip, instead of Balotelli, who scored a 3-0 win over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with power.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli, is between the lines of the opponent than a fish in the water.
This feature is not common for a player who runs on the grass at a best speed of around 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves a big thank you for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told how Liverpool has systematically developed the Northwest Londoner, who grew up at the foot of Wembley, into a more comprehensive player than just a cross-country skier.
Susanna Mälkki was elected the Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra as of autumn 2016.
Newspapers all over the Los Angeles Times have been asking which orchestra he's gonna take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new job with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the music scene of our country for more than a hundred years, for example by premiering a large number of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with several members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he says.
Administrations of employees' organisations meet in a pension negotiation case - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, we are looking for a new impetus for pension negotiations from the social partners’ own meetings.
The administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
The labour market organisations have, among other things, been heated by the dispute over the linkage of retirement age to life expectancy.
The associations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimates, it would be created during this week.
Confessed.
Woman Volley, a women’s volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, stumbled on the league riser Vampula Athletes in the final of the training tournament in Pihtiputaa on Sunday.
Vampulla won a 3-2 win in a stretched match to five.
The last round WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and in the passport game Vampula was a bit better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo’s spruce was sore that the 190-inch American centurion Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
She played for Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury and with Johanna Pekkarinen formed WoVo’s most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskimäki was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilled Russian passari and the freer Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shopper" at 6 pm in the official training game.
We will meet again on Sunday at the sports school.
Lidl is forging wild figures in Finland
During the financial year ended at the end of February, the net sales of the company’s stores in Finland grew by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer causes more deaths in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
The lead researcher, Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, confirms that women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
In older women, and with the cancer spreading more widely, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to explain why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is declining, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients treated far from home.
Dr. Jordan’s study found that women with ovarian cancer have poor long-term survival rates regardless of geographic location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old housewife living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to confirm the snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to Hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposed town plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be publicly displayed at the service point Osviitta.
Opinions on the draft plan are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland EY Centre.
With the change of the station plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobiling activities related to tourism in the area.
It is planned to form a park area, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and its river.
From 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available.
Tanking stations may also be located in a specified area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling in winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and the change in the plan have also aroused loud opposition.
The residents of neighbouring buildings have been annoyed by both the sound and the emissions.
However, the area’s emissions have been studied and the studies have not revealed any findings that exceed the guide values.
Renewed vehicles are also less polluting than the old ones.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further, the hotel’s safari customers should be transported to the safari’s departure points by buses with an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of Friendship Park and its surroundings are also wide enough for snowmobiles, better than the places proposed as substitute starting points, such as the boat pier on the eastern side of Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is also good for its location, because in the future the activities can be expanded to the Ounaspaviljongi area, for example.
Establishment of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by allocating enough high-quality areas to logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also listed as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s sub-plan, which has not yet acquired legal force.
Ownership of apartments decreases in garden shops
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of under-35-year-olds, could lead to a fall in turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" for garden sales in terms of age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the UK.
According to a report by the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking space. Also, these factors threaten the gardening sector, which is estimated to be worth around <0xC2><0xA3> 5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest spending per household on horticultural products in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Gardening Association (RHS), an increase in apartment rentals or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, head of gardening at RHS, says that “for example, plants grown in mobile containers are particularly popular with tenants because such containers can be taken with them when they need to move.”
According to the HTA report, the period 1997-2005 was a booming period for horticultural resale, as ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, compared with worse weather in March and April of last year.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called on the country’s most experienced US diplomat to report on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. embassy chief of affairs and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal Turkey was the main target of espionage by US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major nations have spied on each other.
A previous report of spying on Ankara by the main German intelligence service caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several success films, has been attached to the female protagonist in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film Two Nights until morning, which starts shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2003 film The Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film The Butterfly in the Glass Dome.
Two Nights to Morning movie starring Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Major Major Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The perpetrators of the case presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Council officials at the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on Mallorca's holiday island, has been arrested for wet partying following allegations of corruption from shop and bar owners in the well-known Magaluf area.
Inspector-in-chief José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after a series of corruption charges were brought against him by the owners of the Punta Ballena street, which houses most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the perpetrators of the incident provided evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Council officials at the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angry at the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
“It’s not about money anymore, it’s about surviving,” a business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines in several countries this summer when an 18-year-old British holidaymaker who had oral sex with 24 men during a pub crawl appeared on the internet.
Since then, the island’s authorities have been trying to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf’s holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year, and Carnage, the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl, was ordered to pay a joint fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000.
The so-called balconing trend has also become popular, especially among young British tourists, in Magaluf, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when their communities were bombarded by rockets and mortars during the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of the schools brought joy and excitement to the rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, at a daycare center in Pashosh, workers removed fragments from the walls and slipped before the children arrived at the daycare center after the rocket hit.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, says returning to school after a long period of time feels “a little weird.”
“We’ve had difficult times where we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of last week’s ceasefire, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas farther away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are skeptical about their return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was the subject of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of the air and sea routes in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
Palestinians and the UN estimate that more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, saying that at least half of the deaths were soldiers, although it has no solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelters in more than 100 UN-supported schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelter and fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of the school the week before.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a sheltered school in Gaza, said in a statement.
According to a commonly used metric, housing prices have risen the most in seven years during the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP’s data revealed on Monday.
As a result of the rise, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, which is higher than in the same months since 2007.
The year-on-year increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of rising prices.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
Housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next busiest, with an average price rise of five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of homes for auction, the overall booming sales rate and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the rise in housing prices will continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have drawn record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
The Serlachius Art Museum has had over 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has exhibited classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Week said on Monday that it had set a visitor record, as 14,500 interested people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
People have snatched through doors and windows,” says Pauli Sivonen, Director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums for the whole year will approach one hundred thousand this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season in Mänttä will continue well over the summer.
New exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum in autumn.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani over the past few days.
On Sunday evening, a window was broken into a commercial property in Pohjolankatu.
He had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel from a truck tank was stolen on Syväojankatu.
A boat with outboard engine had been taken from the Pääläsenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
Inside, the inscription "OIVA" was written on the side of the nose.
A couple of suspected thieves have already been caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into.
A police dog got a trail and a 20-year-old man was found hiding under a tree in the forest.
On Monday, the police arrested another man who is also suspected of the same break-in.
Disappeared Amphetamine Accused of Murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine resulted in a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man went into the apartment with his partner and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman, suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charges and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident was reported to the police when a police patrol stopped a car with a group of people burning the clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to the burnt garments, a cut-off shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will rule on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, August, which is as hot, repeats itself on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual throughout the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, “My father never hugged me.”
She never said she loved me
Henry was born to a seven-child Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and his father's relationship was distant.
Henry is currently rehearsing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is developed based on the Radio 4 channel series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap in the upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother’s death, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, “Stop the noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and talked about things like the shape of a beer punch or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, giving him an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though the working conditions are better today than they were at the time.
The smelters are a bit brighter nowadays, but they are practically dark, smokey, maze-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot glimpse and remind us of Hades.
Father used to take a bath and lie down only in the bathtub, and slowly he began to sing to himself as he washed off the dirt from the smelter.
As I walked around the melting plant, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry’s childhood lacked the intimacy offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother got sick a little before she died that we started telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes of my mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from severe overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full reversal.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce my symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s well-known short beard perhaps depicts his change during his career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in the making of the theater.
It was followed by the Comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences.
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was only 16 years old.
A dishwasher spotted him doing imitations on stage and contacted the New Faces.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For quite a while, I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to produce jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living stardom and being on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a lightweight entertainment show that featured people dressed up as black, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favourite and lightweight entertainment program" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
In the '80s, Henry worked on another comedy series, which both made fun of and admired the black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was released in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the following decade working on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movies, but after his LennyHenry.tv show on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just standing still or walking by."
Radio 4's documentary "What's So Great About...?"
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn’t really taught to us in school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears pantyhose and has money.
That’s why Shakespeare scared me.
All the people we interviewed on the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don’t abandon the whole idea until you know what you’re talking about.
“Date words and you’ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 verses of Othello's final speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the internship process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The show was ultimately a success.
Obviously, it was expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once upon a time, there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do it alone for 10 minutes until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the scene, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the show, stay in your role."
Henry " Fences " at the Duchess Theatre
Learning to play Fences was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Of course, this is what Henry says in a dull voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: our conversations are constantly interrupted by the little boys of humor as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from the stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks from an unknown audience.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater when I feel like it, but in general, it doesn’t excite me the way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It’s a real pleasure for me to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
Yeah, I think so.
I like to act...
It's really fun.
I keep telling the story, and I enjoy doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya sets up register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to compile a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "fantastic workers" from government payroll lists.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still being paid for leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, “ghost workers” wages and other financial misconduct cost at least <0x24>1 million a month.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid after a person has died or left office, according to a BBC report from Nairobi's capital, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All officials must register themselves in identification centers in the coming weeks to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric form, the government said in a statement.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, because it will determine how many people actually work in their positions, and it will clean up the payrolls at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s result for the financial year 2015 may remain at a deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparations, the annual margin is set to be around 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways to improve efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, purchases of services, sale of assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
Of the EUR 10 million target to reduce investments, 8.5 million will be allocated.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a five per cent cut in state shares further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Council agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned towards a goal that is consistent with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board sent the proposals back to the Executive Board for preparation.
The City Board’s proposals will be the basis for the budget preparation at the council’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the City Board and City Council through the committee’s deliberation.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of ‘conspiracy’ against Turkish government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots,” according to local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were involved in corruption investigations last December against government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale criminal syndicate and tracking telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said police action was part of an action planned by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children will return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
September 1st ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
First-day celebrations include traditionally children’s embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas' Perry Says Defamation Tweet Was Unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed Twitter account sent a slanderous picture of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of his hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I've deleted it," the post said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Even though the tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a slanderous cartoon of Travis’ district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's office funding when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial, a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The headline of the tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as allowed... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His influential legal support team has asked the court to dismiss the allegations, saying the law that prosecuted the longest-serving governor of Texas is unclear when mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut <0x24>7.5 million in government subsidies to the State Public Inviolability Department, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-lean monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place in the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by tweeting a photo of himself jogging on a lake with the text “Here I come, South Carolina!”
Berkeley says the housing market is “normal” again
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the housing market in South East England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
Housing in the capital, London, has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price rises, while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the booming financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal after the 2013 peak," adding that this has enabled a "stable operating environment."
The London housing market went well during the recession, with hordes of foreign investors aspiring to the capital.
According to the land register, prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, well above the average of 6.7 % in England and Wales.
Average sales prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London’s real estate a less attractive destination in recent months – some interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric on a possible “map tax” before the May general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower market growth in terms of both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed that the number of eligible loans fell in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
The real estate agency Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast on London property prices by 3%, as the price index that measured homeowners’ opinions on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter compared to a year ago, real estate agent WA Ellis said.
Demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased revenues from sold properties to over <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, the right product at the best locations has remained stable and, therefore, sales have remained lively."
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, nearly a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The Berkeley stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange for <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 this afternoon.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker claiming to hold photos of a hundred other stars leaked naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence.
A spokesman for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the images are authentic and denounced the hacker as a “insolent breach of privacy.”
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The photos, originally published on the 4chan photo release page, had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple’s iCloud storage system. On the list of hundreds of other hacked stars, there are allegedly dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is unclear how much of the images are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead denounced the hacking on Twitter.
"To those watching photos taken by my husband and me in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you're in a good mood," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series, Victoria Justice, denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "those so-called nudes of me are FALSE, don't you understand?"
Let me finish this right from the start.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images.
We're the only ones to have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed novel about love and the letter J.
They dissolved, it best described what had happened, and gradually they fell apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
It was only from time to time that he heard from her that she was too serious, too laborious, too intense, too detached, and perhaps also a bit thorny.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was spiky, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had been in the early stages of a relationship that, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some meaning to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair, and she was a delicate beauty with a joyful heart, from a northern village that was even more rugged and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern supposed to be his aunt; his aunt had inherited a house in a moist but paradise-like valley, which was appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, spiders were in all the bathrooms, snails had left their marks on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
Candidates will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country could hear calming music and calming news, as Ailinn’s christened, sun-brown feet brought to her mind a song that had been sung long ago.
Your feet are too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned—nothing was actually banned—they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word forgot.
Public opinion accomplished what law and banishment had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
As the day went on, Kevern began to tap on an imaginary piano and sing a serenade to Ailin's big legs with a rudely comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could slip out of his lips.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of a word that starts with a "j" and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it’s not a fun game now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz was not banned, it was not played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Wisdom had done the same.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was cleverness through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that she could not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for legislation or coercion.
The obedience of society meant that each of its members accepted with gratitude—thankful that they were spared by the trade of fortune—the principle that each group did the things inherent in it.
Due to their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry are best suited for entertaining and exercising, so they sang and ran.
Originally natives of the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their task was to ensure that each family had a working phone that was used to handle affairs.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When THE WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled swiftly in fear of being accused of blazing flames and fearing that those flames would catch up with them, opened up restaurants serving labneh-poljogh.
Let each do according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for her to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung could ever have been translated into music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the bigfoot.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
Not a single word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailin didn’t understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn already thought he was weird.
"It was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the world but Ailin's huge, crow-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren’t really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I think you're attractive because of your fat ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of his sweet eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her patio chair, pouring over the receiver and pouring out the wine they had just drunk.
Even the wine was made only from lingonberries, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what fascinates me perversely about you," he said.
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that was evident in her eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to confront her.
Did Ailinn think she was gonna hit him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been like life here.
The same vast, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, though still paler and more devilish than their grandparents, who were smugglers and disfellowshippers, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word for an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the irrelevant love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, because sucking in itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised her.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern pass through the window upstairs, a man who was himself responsible for his difficult life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
She felt pity for Kevern and for the men in general, though some of them had raised their hands to attack him.
The man who turned his back, bowed, shamed, beaten, who had lost all will to fight—why did he feel so familiar with the vision, when he could not remember having ever seen it before?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event was just described, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Private Institute for the Measurement of Public Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the persistence of minor to moderate violence in areas of the country where the reduction, or even the cessation, of violence was most likely, given the money and energy spent on eradicating it.
"Many things have already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to counteract the natural aggression of a people who have fought for thousands of years and have mostly won, especially in those deserted and remote places where, despite the hedge towers, human kindness has rarely been known in time.
However, some things cannot be eliminated altogether.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it produces.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, devour stories of conquered adversities, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban-style co-habitation areas in its perpetual grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more evil-souled arguing in our park, in our homes and in our workplaces.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
The question is: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
You're a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There are no prejudices at this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as those that you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the Church—and what you call cruelty or evil spirit, others usually call innate energy and physical strength.
Knowing what happened, if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the earth’s fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingo pink LED light proclaimed the instruction that Ofnow had given to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and singing is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand well what you're trying to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, confident that her instructor had stopped, "and I just want to say that we're not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I worry that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED.
This time, though, we will not pour out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "describing as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far by saying that they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'.
Someone in your position should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we're being completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group in society can say they've behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk more about this – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do so.
But what is the past for, if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, expressing that Esmen was about to leave.
The next day, on his normal way to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, who was described by passers-by as "evil-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho military denies planned attack; prime minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied having staged an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had besieged his official residence and taken over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to the neighboring country of South Africa after reporting that he had been threatened with death.
An army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack, saying that the army responded to a threat from "political fanatics".
"Lesotho's defense forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military’s actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be consistent in every respect with the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt," he said.
Lesotho army officials said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has been experiencing tensions since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to disagreements with the government of a large coalition.
He denies that he has disregarded the power of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement to the media, Microsoft said it would not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been guessed as the location of the centre.
Microsoft will completely shut down its Oulu office, which will take about 500 people out of their jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company did not comment on how much staff the new data center would employ.
The establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa was announced by Kauppalehti on Monday.
Man accused of hitting a girl in traffic lights
A 78-year-old man is charged with hitting a three-year-old girl at a traffic light in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of hitting a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart drove his Audi Q3 recklessly and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to take place in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a variety of device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around <0x24>300.
I personally took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than <0x24>350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other parts of the camera are sealed watertight.
In addition, set the camera’s shooting settings to match the photos or video you’re taking.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize underwater shooting conditions.
Also – before jumping into the water, make sure how far your device can take you.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, while others can withstand a depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and composing an image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows fork-up, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or ocean.
This also gives you more colors for your images; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the subject you're shooting.
This is an important advice when shooting on land, but even more important under water, because the light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, which means that the photographer must be close to the subject to fill the entire frame of the image.
China will not allow Hong Kong to elect its leaders – protesters pledge revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament ruled that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in the business district of Hong Kong, after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision gives the Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who disobey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still outrageous," said Democratic Party chair Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People’s Congress committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidacy for a Hong Kong leader would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region to elect their own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through a nomination committee administered from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, some of the largest and most noticeable protests in the region took place in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and that they would trigger waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organisers said that the movement "sees the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and no other path".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the occupation of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are gradually losing control of their city.
The wave of people arriving from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement for threatening Hong Kong’s vitality —the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts," said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see the worry spread that Hong Kong is slipping away from us.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the henchmen of the revolutionary Western powers.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights with 780,000 participants – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
U.S. prom tradition strikes UK universities: private jets for new students
We are thrilled to meet the demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury travel form for today’s students.
In addition to a private jet, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure a memorable entry to the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a safety aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the limit.
Combined with many of the VIF features (VIP Friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest-quality transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet been made as the service has just been set up, but added that “students will start making orders within the next few weeks.”
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 in tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and wishes. Now more than ever, it’s important to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticized the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s higher education department, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the majority of students.”
Many start their studies this month, shocked by the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and scholarships has lagged behind the staggering increase in basic living costs. Only then can we begin to think about where we can find thousands to spend on something as simple as coming to campus.
Ipswich "pig house" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of a house for sale in Suffolk after noting that a large pig was lying in the house’s living room.
The one-bedroom house, priced at <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the picture ended up in the announcement by accident and has since been removed," a spokesman for the company said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as “a unique one-bedroom house.”
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from their website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where people have asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish forward Fernando Torres was able to leave Chelsea, but the substitute stepped in with almost the same opening.
Chelsea has signed a four-year contract with Loic Remy’s neighboring club QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, enters AC Milan on a two-year loan.

An accident in the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday left 11 people seriously injured, including four.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but hope of finding survivors faded.
The initial cause of the explosion is a gas leak.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so intense that it shook buildings within a radius of more than a hundred meters.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing,” said Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash site.
On Sunday, an emergency room was set up for the residents of the school.

Bulgarian prison staff holds national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of Sofia’s Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted the old working regulations, which were recently amended, back.
The salary increases will also be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours, saying that they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the Prison Workers’ Organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgaria’s National Radio (BNR) said.
Negotiations are underway, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
Members of the Ministry of the Interior’s Trade Union of Prison Workers are also expected to join the protest.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget his sparkling US matches and defeat Ukraine in the second half with his stalling solutions.
But Salin handed all the credit to the wolfmen, and he did it in style:
I was going to faint at the end of the field, the encouragement was so great.
In his eyes, he was blurry, he couldn't do anything.
The noise and the white sea were almost too much for me.
Salin’s intense moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, robbery, discs and tinkering everywhere it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere at some point, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu glowed.
That's my role.
Doing all that.
It was great to see that others got caught up in the plot.
It infects the whole gang.
Salin is the team’s joy pill and spirit builder, so it’s no wonder that his example put the whole team on the fly, which was too much for the big and rough-handed Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years break: The previous ones made me think of an outrageous referee game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men’s national volleyball team played in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 Argentinian tournament, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament: it was a fiery match against France in the first round.
“The referee’s game in the ballots of that match was blatant,” recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams were already in the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that, the shit went a lot more crazy,” Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is among the world’s champions again, as the World Cup in Poland takes off on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
Players’ strength values are roughly the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average size of the players has also increased.
The game is faster,” Parkkali thought.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland moving forward from the first stage.
Then it can get tough,” says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victorious match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we get to 17th place.
"South Korea and Tunisia should go down," Parkkali said.
Kingdom Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
The sauna and evening retreat at the seamen's church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's 1982 World Cup programme.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook post that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure and pull it a little bit forward, but its legs just didn't carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
By the end of the night, the situation had already begun to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen, and headed for their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the hillside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message he sent to Ilta-Sanomi.
Soon a German man arrived with a trip mattress.
The mattress gave Cita a pair of pads to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the hill for a moment in his arms,” Soini says.

The dog was transported down with the help of an excursion mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for “international heroes” to thank them once again.
The sounds answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
"I don't know what I would have done without these heroes," Mikkelsen said.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I would love to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I will forever be grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the sounds were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - I hear Cita is feeling better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death due to a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers believed for most of her youth that she had only a few years to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, a disease that causes motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and toe bouncing.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would end up in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things that others do.
I fell every day and it took me longer than anyone else.
I could never skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied in school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. When the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers stating that he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.
When I learned from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would end up in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his gait had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl darling, I don’t think you have this disease, otherwise you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT is, I thought I was postponed," she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The passengers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to police, the migrants had paid around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 each to get to Greece, and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800-900 to get to Serbia.
A large number of illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a population of a few million on their way to Western Europe.
Already three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence

In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for Scots, which only happens once in their lives.
In the past, actor Sean Connery has supported independence.
British stars such as Paul McCartney and David Bowie have called on the Scottish people to remain a part of Britain.
In the Gallups, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in the middle of summer - Kotimaan news - Ilta-Sanomat
The downturn in the department store trade continued also in July, according to Päivätavarakauppa ry.
According to the report, the turnover of department store and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than one year ago.
Sales of home and leisure products have been the worst guaranteed, with net sales falling by more than seven per cent year-on-year.
Clothing sales were also significantly lower than in the previous summer.
The value of retail sales of daily consumer goods, on the other hand, grew by almost three per cent year-on-year in July.
Sales grew most in small stores and large supermarkets.
During the first part of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets decreased by more than two per cent.
Sales of everyday goods, on the other hand, have increased by almost 1%.
Joan Rivers' family "hopes for the best"

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto reactor 3 will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima.
According to Areva’s announcement, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to applications for approval of the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years behind schedule.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the completion time of the third reactor.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas – value about 60,000 euros
The Nastola Municipal Board donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Vilkäne.
The local government showed a fair spirit of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel sounds at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
Bottas's gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven.
The municipality will dismantle them this year with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are pleased that he has enjoyed his birth and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, the mayor said.
The municipal manager estimates the financial value of the beach plot to be EUR 4000-60000.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
With varying success over the decades, Nastola has kept successful athletes through gift plots in the municipality.
World Champion Aki Parviainen and aerobics world champion Tuuli Matinsalo got their own home plots from the municipality and built fabulous homes.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved to another place as the life situation changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syrakki says and believes Bottas will remain in his hometown.
Hull hired attacker Hernandez with record sum
Hull invested the club's record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch from Palermo to Hull for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million, or about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won the Serie B and entered the Italian league.
For the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
Hernandez came to the pitch in two games at the World Cup last summer.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," Hull coach Steve Bruce said.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal’s national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian Space Experiment Failed: Geckos Killed on Sex Trip
The five small geckos that Russia sent into space to reproduce have died, according to the Russian Federation's Roscosmos space agency.
The Gekkos travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the ground on Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study gecko reproductive capacity and use in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although it sounds strange, the purpose of the experiment was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
The effects on geeks can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on a person if he or she stayed in a state similar to that for longer periods of time, New Statesman illustrated in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or causes of death of the geeks will be determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers who were called "sexy geeks" were frozen.
The surprising thing is that the fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip and also had offspring.
France Arrests Terrorist Suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities tracked him down after he lured a 16-year-old girl to leave for Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, but now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalized young people attracted to wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
It is estimated that some 800 French citizens or registered in France have travelled to, or are planning to travel to, Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning.
The basketball team’s hopes for a continuation are in play when Finland faces Ukraine in its second match at the World Cup today.
If the opening loss for the United States was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the continuation.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning,” Peter Koponen said.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of the 100 meters three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we have to get our norm defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than in yesterday’s defeat to the United States.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that a normal wolf pack will be seen on the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood Stars Claimed to Be Naked Are Spreading On The Internet, Some Verified to Be Authentic
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are allegedly portrayed by famous celebrities.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a ‘naked campaign’.
TMZ has released an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant breach of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts Jennifer Lawrence’s stolen photos will be prosecuted.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that her images are authentic.
She took these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the terrible pain that was put into this.
I sympathize with everyone who was a victim of hacking," he wrote.
Actress Victoria Justice says the images in her name are fake.
There are also genuine or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticized his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala’s comments after Sunday’s VPS match illustrate the club’s current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adjust to everything,” Viitala said after the 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper, Viitala, was not pleased with poor defense play.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a fast pace.
With game roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some of them don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala said without naming a single player.
Honga's coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to the training and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players can’t be expected to be an immediate success, as their buddies are constantly changing.
It has not been the same team twice in a row.
Especially on the defensive side, the group has changed.
That is the main reason we are in this position,” Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after a VPS loss, even with the TPS, which is the second-last.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espooers still have time to avoid falling into the first league.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop a team now.
We’re not really going to fall out of this series,” the goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier is making a TV series after decades of break
Filmmaker Lars von Trier is returning to the TV series.
The Danish director is working on a television series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was announced today by Trier film producer Louise Vesth at the Venice Film Festival.
Production company Zentropa said the shooting of the series should begin in 2016.
Trier is reported to be engaged in the scriptwork of the series starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
Trier’s long-time partner, producer Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, who is known for his harsh sales talk, also announced the mysterious project.
According to him, such a series “has never been seen and will never be seen.”
"Hold your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, is known for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s he directed the Kingdom series.

There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 people.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
the Ice Bucket Challenge from the chin dislocated
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when she was poured ice-cold water over her face that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment for screaming during the Ice Bucket Challenge so hard that she lost her jawbone.
Isabelle Roberts was screaming so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just yelled, but as I yelled, I felt my chin getting stiff," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and started laughing, but I had to hurry to the ER.
The 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to a hospital where his jaw was put back in place.
The video has become an internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The point of view of wolves howling (also): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
We had a great time today.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France at the Maroussi ball-hall in Athens.
Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about one hundred Finns who shouted at the 20,000 spectators in the otherwise empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times as many troops as 100 Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships were the season of Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, a qualifying match for Russia at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä to the final team with limelines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
It is now possible to say that Dettmann was wise from a distance, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dive deep.
At the Olympics in Athens, there were about a hundred Finns present.
It included journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number in between, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go and see how our girls and boys are doing in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Surely, both in Spain and at the World Volleyball Championships in Poland, there are Finns looking for an experience.
A common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself has to be attractive.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to see art in Berlin.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At the time, coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to enter the top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activity was lifted to the pedestal.
The Volleyball team did the same move a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productise their top sports where the Holy Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what this kind of carnivalist support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Will ball sports be able to transfer this massive interest to home series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played for an average of hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
The other school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for the companions in the middle of the drug.
Securing the plot of Bottas - almost 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola rewards Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas with a shore-side home plot.
The Municipal Board unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment.
At Nastola, Bottas's success has been monitored since his karting season.
He is considered a good ambassador for the marketing of Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of Nastola Municipality as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolished buildings in the area, six of which will be demolished by the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth prize ball in Formula 1 in Belgium this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in his childhood in Villahti.
He currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever he is free of forms.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by the ball players on the field, but also by Marcus Giron, an amateur at the top of college players.
He said the shirt will help him keep track of his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which information is transmitted to the suede in the shirt and from there to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The mokkula, which acts as the central unit, is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given the exact time of the start of the sale of the shirt, nor has it even implied its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren isn’t the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Athos, California, has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothing costs <0x24>100 per piece and the required thumb-sized central unit costs <0x24>200.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
A clever way to save in textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds <0x24>1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on expenses.
He developed a system whereby students in later grades borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them right away.
"My math book would normally have cost <0x24>180; I paid <0x24>10 to use it for the entire semester, plus a thick sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his books for last semester would normally have cost <0x24>430.
Instead, he spent <0x24>120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying significantly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus book stores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics in the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from on-campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
E-shops
A new book can only be purchased at a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is recommended for almost <0x24>290, but the book is available online at Chegg.com for <0x24>239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not bothered by the notes of others and worn out appearance.
For example, a "Calculus" book can be used at Chegg.com for <0x24>93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought a book called “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” for just <0x24>0.42 on Amazon.com.
A new book would have cost <0x24>48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after you have completed the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a book "Calculus" for an entire semester costs about <0x24>20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, use of the highlighter, and fees for wear and tear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of regular paper may also be an option.
Sometimes these books are rented, and then the e-book is paid for access to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store sells Calculus as an e-book for about <0x24>61 for six months.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It’s worth comparing different vendors, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine’s law school, recommends using the book’s ISBN number to determine the price, as it can be used to make sure you’re looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He learned this through the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to purchase the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in the fires as last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Federation (Spek), so far 55 people have died in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of those killed, 36, were men.
There were 11 people over 65.
According to the organization’s fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when by the end of August, 64 people had died in the fires.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other detached houses.
Spek reminds you of home fire safety.
At least all fire alarms in the home should be verified, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that initial extinguishing equipment is easily usable.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be informed of the electrical appliances they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport City for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the events over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had even come from Belgium.
Young People Rescued by Air in Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were brought to safety after a night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
Families were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search team of local police and helpers was sent to look for the young, and the duo was found near the Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The cops spent the night with the couple and were taken to safety on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
Ukraine says paratroopers have been struggling with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a military spokesman, the gunfire of the opposing party has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooters.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol ship that was hit by artillery yesterday off the south-eastern coast of Ukraine sank this morning, border guards said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
Border guards weren't sure where the ship was shot at.
The separatists reported on social media that they shot a ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk talks today should lead to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday after heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars underneath.
Authorities estimated on Sunday that it might take some time to calm the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by the heavy rains, and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on-call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rainforest that plagued the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French Socialists should “silence and help France,” says François Hollande’s main supporter
Valls urged the deeply divided Left to "show its feelings" towards a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not obtain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said and deserved the applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister urged the government to leave behind the controversial 35-hour week of French work, despite a controversial proposal by the new finance minister, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira provoked dissent by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, mocked the ongoing socialist strife and said he did not believe the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
François Hollande may have gone to war by phone, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party’s proposal to dissolve the Parliament and was convinced of his party’s victory in early elections, and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top of the list in the May European elections.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche published on Sunday, 76 percent of French believe that the Socialist Party could split into several rival groups before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Po University political scientist Pascal Perrineau warned that the French will soon lose patience if the new Socialist government fails to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a slight chance of success, but the audience must quickly notice that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Pokka betrayed Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recorded part of the programme.
The Good Morning Finland programme posted a funny video of the recordings on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record Morning Finland’s advertising puff from the next day’s broadcast, but the recording is not going to go very well.
Alm-Siira goes mad with her words as she tries to pronounce the word budget rag, and her madness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their poka again and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live even tomorrow," the Finnish Facebook post reads.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at Lehtikuva’s photo agency, finished third in a series of portraits in 1972.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held on Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
Immediately I realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir’s face shows that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
At that time, the competition took pictures of well-known people or events.
It’s great that you can succeed with other images nowadays, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall at the Munich Olympics.
I didn’t send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 man-years.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his doctoral thesis on information technology for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the purpose of investigating a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the wall of the school: "Fish and chicken in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special announcement on the wall of a school in Pirkkala’s Women’s Journey caused a food crisis on social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old note on the wall of the school.
You can see the picture here.
The image on social media has led people to send angry feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleanliness service, tells Yle that the note on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was sometimes such an idea that has been discussed with health care at the time.
Every student gets the meal they want, he says.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or a nurse about a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle because experiments with young vegetarian foods may leave the nutrition incomplete and the lack of meat or chicken may amaze the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise close to <0x24>3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for <0x24>3 billion.
The acquisition would give Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalization of <0x24>6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises, as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not yield any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public, because the negotiations did not take place in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, and Apollo’s representative declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships with route maps covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it was <0x24>2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its net sales in 2013 were <0x24>1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The <0x24>29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies compete to become the first choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 transaction, worth <0x24>850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current line-up following a merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested <0x24>1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting held 28 per cent of the company, Apollo 20 per cent and private equity company TPG Capital LP 8 per cent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The City Council of Tampere is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Council will strongly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the period of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, it has become more common around the world to believe that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is not environmentally and ethically sustainable.
We would like to see this in Tampere as well.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Juomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for closure of the dolphinarium.
The death of Näsi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, to close the dolphin prison and to begin to find out how the dolphins of Tampere could be transferred to a demarcated sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Your Näsi didn’t have time to experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the remaining dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than the unenriched concrete bed, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Union aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the framework of a comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on 1 September.
A demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the separate region, Russian news sources said.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine should become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the start of the violence five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region, and thus to force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya independence instead of Russia to the West.
In an interview with the state's Channel 1 channel, Putin denounced the Ukrainian army's attempts to retake the eastern separatist-controlled Donetsk and Lugansk territories, which were occupied by the separatists in March and April, following Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently christened the region as the “Novorossiya”, the “New Russia” – a term reminiscent of the glorious days before the Russian Revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said the planned peace talks would be “illusions” as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he said.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “statehood” is related to broader independence, which has been discussed with Kiev’s leadership for months in an attempt to dispel Russian-speaking regions’ fears that their cultural and linguistic rights would be under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov said.
There can be no talks on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
A Kremlin spokesman’s interpellation aimed at correcting Putin’s “misinterpretation” of comments underlined that the Russian regime treats the separatist uprising in the east differently than in the case of Crimea, where it practically occupied an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnic Russians and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin virtually power over the region that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia five months ago, houses the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historical coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea in Russia, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce vital products for the Russian army.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators – after new elections – consider constitutional amendments to increase the power of decision of regions outside the Ukrainian core region over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area on the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to occupy the entire strategically important coastal area as far as Crimea.
This has led to a massive civilian and military reinforcement of the city of Mariupol, known as the steel-producing port city between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging them to take further action to prevent future violations by Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders called for further sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flared up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovask region after two Russian armoured forces and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the separatists in trouble, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in Ukraine a week ago.
The opening goal for Milan was scored by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first, and a little later Jeremy Menez was hit for a penalty kick.
Lazio also scored a penalty at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
At the training debut of Milan's ex-attacker icon Inzaghi, San Siro Stadium was only half complete.
The match had a total of 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has said he is outraged that hackers may have stolen naked pictures of his fiancée and Hollywood's A-star Gabi Grecko.
The world of entertainment has been swarming since a number of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were posted on the Internet as a result of a widespread celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of star Lawrence and other superstars, including supermodel Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko were also reportedly stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 names of celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential, “This is disgusting.”
All personal contacts and photos should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, who lives in New York City, reportedly commented on the incident as "shameful" and said the victims "feel disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 shots of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer in topless at the pool edge.
Palmer's film credits include "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the Chuck series Strahovski and actor Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence’s spokesman told TMZ that “it is an insolent breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen said in a tweet: “Releasing stolen photos from a cell phone is no different from selling a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if it were at home and achieved a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the pictures of fans.
Katowice in Poland was white on Monday: not Polish red-white, but Finnish blue-white.
According to STT, nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland’s victory at the Spodek Arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
That’s how much the fans influenced our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already 0-2 in the match, but went on to win 3-2 in the match.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miraculous rise behind six points.
Cuba already led the round 16-10, but after that the Finns got enthusiastic.
However, a couple of Finnish fans were disappointed when a chartered plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw missed the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a high pace in recent days.
At the World Basketball Championships in Bilbao, Spain, more than 8,000 Finnish fans are present.
As if every basket in Finland was a winning basket, US star Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday’s match.
The Board meeting will not be broadcast live due to technical problems
