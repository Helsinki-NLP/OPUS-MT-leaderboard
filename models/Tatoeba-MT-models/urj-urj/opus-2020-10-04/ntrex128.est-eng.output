The members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they look like Muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly have been diminished from the recommendation to change their term of office to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Wales Parliament).
The subject has begun from the plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends at the National Assembly are concerned that this may lead to laughing.
One member of the National Assembly of Leiborists said that his group members were concerned because it rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp.
For clarification to readers outside Wales: the word daft in cocoa and pwp means cocka.
A member of the plaid said that the entire group is “not happy” and has offered other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Relationship said that his group would take the name change “acceptably”, but stated that the word “MWP” is very similar to Muppet.
To explain: in the language of kõmri, the expression of the star w is similar to that of the Yorkshire English language u.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on name change, said: "The final decision on all the names to be called by the members of the National Assembly will, of course, be itself."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on proposals on the name, on the basis of which the ideas of renamed the National Assembly as the Wales Parliament are broadly supported.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Members of Parliament or WMPs’, but the participants in the public survey supported the largest option ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal for changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also covers other amendments to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly will remain to the members themselves in the legislative debate.
The Macedonians will organise a referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as ‘the Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The referendum shall be organised with a view to addressing a dispute with Greece, a neighbouring country which has its province, Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long been saying that its name of the northern neighbour represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the accession of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the referendum to be held on the list change, has said that he intends to abstain from the vote.
The voters in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue, however, that the change in name is only the price that the country would pay for accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are quiet because Harlem Churches are struggling in difficulty
“The older people I've spoken to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
"They're not either."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People communicate in different ways today,” he said.
"The bars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms where people are staying every day."
As for churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “they will be back sooner or later in the beginning”.
Adams added that the churches can be replaced by apartments full of people who do not give help to the rest of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who will therefore speed up the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors, because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Holy Martin Church ten years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacksmiths who had worshiped God so far took over the property right of the building.
The Afro American congregation of St. Martin’s church was at the forefront with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boikot against the 125th Street shops of Harlem when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the Father’s Johnson congregation planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and author in St Martin’s church, Reverend David Johnson called the chariot proudly “the watches of poor people. ”
The expert who played the Crime in July gave it another name: “Cultural value” and“ unreplaceable historical tool”.
The expert from the University of Tiffany Ng Michigan also noted that it was the first cartel in the world, played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger chariot in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Holy Martin Church did not replace him.
In the past few months of the church of St. Martin, a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved in the secular leaders of the church, other bishops.
In July, the governing body of the congregation, which consisted of secular leaders, complained to the bishop in writing that the bishop ‘entrives costs’, although the presidency was not even related to the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some of the members of the company were complaining about the poor transparency of the bishop's actions.
In California, the shark was injured by a boy diving after 13 years of homars.
According to the authorities, the 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and injured by the shark, dived on the homaari season's opening day in California.
Attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he had been diving with friends about a half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's help and then swimming with others to help him pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy was enthusiastic about getting the lobster, but “then he realized that the boy was screaming,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
The whole of his ringbone was shredded naked," described the vision he saw when he got to the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water, “The water is a shark,” added Hammel.
In a life-threatening state, the boy was taken with a plane to Rady's childcare in San Diego.
The type of assault shark is still unknown.
At the press conference, the sanitary and Captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous shark type.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were in the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours on the research and safety objectives from Casablast to Swamini.
Giles added that there are more than 135 sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take the power of the United Kingdom's beauty products market
I gotsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' chains, creating supermarket-like decorations, where expert advisers also work.
As part of a significant entry into the UK’s 2,7 billion pounds of beauty market, which, as a result of the decline in sales of fashion and domestic goods, will continue to rise, will be tested for wider divisions of beauty products in 11 shops across the country, taking them into place in other stores next year, if they are successful.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways of using the shelf space previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and domestic goods.
Sainsbury said that he intends to double his selection of beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time also trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product choices from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas that are currently found in Boot's stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its brand Boutique series of makeup products, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, because young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing the exclusive licenses in two of the Sainsbury stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Shopping in the web and moving on to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's Managing Director Mike Coupe has said that sales sites are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight cheap sales chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury has placed Argos' sales sites in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats' sales sites, since Sainsbury's purchased both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the Supermarket to upgrade its departments of beauty and medicine ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a ribbon on how to share profits from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after 281 sons in Sainsbury sold their pharmaceutical business three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, with a whole Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyd, adding its four stores to the product selection luxury leather maintenance products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business leader, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the environment for customers.
We have also spent money on special training for workers who are always ready to advise.
Our choice of trademarks meets every need. The attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competing place for beauty trade, which can change the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is mad because Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million pound deal.
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left with a "raven" when the television broadcaster Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million pounds deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the trademark of domestic goods and clothes for Truly.
Couple of business is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old director of This Morning reported his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones' anger, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources told me that Jones was a "funny" when the TV stargirl confessed at a tense meeting that took place on Tuesday at the Marlows Buckinghamshire headquarters of a man's business empire, that his new contracts in the value of GBP 1.5 million mean that a woman has no longer enough time to commit to the brand of domestic clothing and clothing Truly.
The business is compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and it was thought that it would double the estimated 11 million pounds of property.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones left Britain to his holiday home.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s main priority.
It had to ensure his farther future, so the woman thought she would deal with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave was a complete amazed at all about it.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-market goods."
The experts believe that the departure of this morning TV shows, one of the most paid celebrities in Britain, can cost millions of them, because the choice of which extends to sofa beds and candles and home clothes has been invested in a luxurious amount of money. It may also result in a later product being placed on the market.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cappi in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the trademark as Chairman in March.
Couples take holiday trips together and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes a brand M&S and is replaced by Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series I'm A Celebrity.
One of the sources close to Jones said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business."
Hard talking, "for what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was directed to him in the news for the comments that some considered "deserved to the President" and for the excessive positiveness of the North Korea Head of State.
Why has President Trump abandoned so much?
Trump said his awkward "new dancer's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards abandoning North Korea's nuclear weapons, interested in the second meeting.
But the negotiations for abandoning nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the North Korean High Representative Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US 'response' for the original weapons of disarmament stations in North Korea.
He pointed out that the US will continue with pressured constraints on the country.
Trump’s encouraging speech was much more enjoyable.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“The war with North Korea began.
Millions of people would be dead.
It's all right with us now."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: missile trials have been completed, hostages have been helped to be released and the introduction of American servants' remains to their homeland.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be a representative, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for this full-toped stadium, it’s better than we have nearly 200 people here,” said Trump, referring to the population in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In addressing the consequences of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared to be a precondition for international assistance.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so that things are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children set up a team to go to the request, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, the press reporter of the National Disaster Office, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in the request to decide whether international authorities are allowed to contribute to assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although a refuge for tsunami has been built in Aceh, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about tsunami, the apparent lack of tsunami warning increased the number of persons likely to be killed.
Traveling between numerous islands in Indonesia is also quite challenging in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stopping in Lomboki to treat the victims of the earthquake will head to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach a new crash site.
The President, Joko Widodo, transformed Indonesia's divided infrastructure into a central part of its electoral campaign and has distributed money on the roads and on the rails.
However, the deficits in the budget are jeopardising Mr Joko's government, to the extent that new elections will take place next year.
Mr. Jokot is also pressured by the tensions in Indonesia among the Gentiles, where most members of the Muslim community have turned to the older form of faith.
More than 1000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the battles between Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge is hitting the fig gate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea at the Premier League, stretching the status of 89th game mile at Stamford Bridge, a Saturday game in London.
Sturrridge received a bait from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 metres from Chelsea Gate when his team led 1 : 0.
He hit the ball on his left before he hit it in a farther direction.
The ball flew high across the penal zone and hit the top right corner of the network.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabaga and fell into the network.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq will give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win for myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, I made one touch, and I gave a more thoughtless hit."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 thanks to 25 minutes of the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit the gate.
The Blues attacker fed the ball back in this game to Mateo Kovac before he turned around in the middle of the field and hit the Liverpool.
Kovacic gave me fast feeding in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading Hazard to punishment.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the ball on the left foot of the Liverpool player Alisson Becker along the remote side of the network.
Liverpool plays with Naples in the Championship subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 Stadio San Paolol in Naples in Italy.
Chelsea is facing the Videoton UEFA Euroliiga game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of victims in Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
In Indonesia’s earthquake and the number of dead in tsunami rose to 822, said the State’s Department of Disastrous on Sunday morning.
A lot of people were trapped on Friday, and the 18-metre giant waves brought under the ruins of the buildings collapsed due to the 7.5-magnetic earthquake, said the press conference of the Office's pressmaster Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The City of Palu, with over 380 000 inhabitants, was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man who suspects murder after stabbing a woman to death.
The murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found in Merseyside in Birkenhead this morning.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found in Grayson Mewsis John Street at 07:55 in the morning.
The police are calling to contact people who might have seen or heard moving in the area.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The research is just early, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious, to contact us.
I would also ask all cab drivers, especially those whose cameras could have recorded something, to contact us because they may have vital information for our investigation."
The police press officer confirmed that the woman found in one building was the local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman's alleged friends came to the scene, asking questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police said they'd be informing the woman's close relatives.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could go into the house or get out of there.
The man was shocked in the case.
The residents were told that getting them back into the house could take hours.
The police officer told a man that the entire area was now treated as a crime scene.
One woman was tearing at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police buses were still closed in the area, and the third was right next to it.
A lot of police officers were standing in this area, watching the apartment.
Anyone who has information on the event will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone 0800 555 111 using the tag word on 30 September 247.
The shape of this House Cromwell is the last sign that is the reason for the debate on the rewrite of history.
The elimination of this would be a poetry justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style of the man's inhuman traitors.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a foolishness and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, the Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “An early debate on the elimination of images, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain a memorial before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't rob the pictures of the English civil war himself, nor did he tell others to do it.
Perhaps a false Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of a man's ancestors Thomas before the century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the person to whom many people still think should be respected."
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people thought it was rather at the end of the 19th, rather than now that Cromwell was a protector of the outside pressure and, in this case, of course, of the royal power.
It is an infinite historic dispute whether this is a precise reflection.
Surely, the middle of the 17th century dispute has shaped our people's further development and Cromwell clearly represents the gap on one side.
His achievements as the Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and remembrance."
With the killer, the Chinese farmer died.
According to local media extractions, a farmer attacked a pig who killed a man on the market in Southeast China.
A man who was identified solely by Yuan, found dead and bloody artery injured from the Liubanshui market in Guizhou province, announced the South China newspaper "Morning Post" on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig operator manufactured in Xining in Qinghai Province in China to vaccinate pigs in his desk.
He was supposed to have come from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the outside crowd was open.
He said there was a big squirrel with bloody mouth in the midst.
The examination of the expert confirmed that the 249,47 kilograms of slaves reportedly had been killed by the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were all bloody and shattered," said Guiyang Evening News, the words of the victim's cousin Wu.
Security camera records showed that Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pig.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man wasn't Yuan's, nor his cousin's.
The Market Manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else until the police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for a man's death.
However, it has rarely been observed before that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 pounds pounded to the tractor of the farmer in Wales until a man’s wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when one of the Oregon farmers ate their own pigs, one of the farmers of Manitoba told the CBC News that the pigs were usually not attacked, but because of the taste of blood, they could get out of their heads.
“They are just playing games.
They're very curious marakrats that aren't meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected enough," said the man.
Orkaan Rosa afterwinds bring large rainbows in the southwest of the United States
According to the forecasts, hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards cooling waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rainfalls over the southern part of the United States to North Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the near future.
Sunday morning at 5:00 a.m. on the east coast time, Rosa was classified as the first category of hurricane with 136.78 kilometres of winds per hour, moving 619.59 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific will develop a low pressure moving east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm to the Peninsula of Baja California on Monday, it will lead the deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25,4 centimeters.
The tropical humidity with the approaching low pressure will then cause extensive rainfalls in the southern part of the country in the near future.
At this point, the rain that landed between 2.54 and 10.16 centimeters causes dangerous suddenly, flood water and potential paintings in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainbows to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to be between 5.08 and 10.16 centimeters in certain southwest regions of the United States, especially Arizona.
Suddenly, rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible due to tropical rain spread.
Certainly, there should not be any danger of tropical rain in the wilderness.
Strong rain can cause the rapid flow of canyons to rivers and squirrel storms to result in outbreaks of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure will occasionally lead to acute rainbows in the coastal areas of South California.
It is possible that the total number of rains reaches more than 27 centimetres and can cause smaller flood water and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the area during the rain season.
Dispersed tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late evening and Monday early morning, rainfalls become extensive Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainbows arrive at Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, the United States predicts high temperature fluctuations caused by the cooling of the Arctic while the temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this leads to high temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he will try to rebuild himself in a long summer heat.
A large part of the United States' central and eastern part of the United States is expected to have a warm October beginning with a wide range of temperatures around 80 warmth degrees from southern to northeastern part of the country.
In New York, 26,6 warmth degrees are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast of climate indicates that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial has been held by over 20 million people.
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched the confessions of the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the accused woman, Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, a political confusion continued where broadcasters interrupted the display of conventional broadcasts to reflect the turns of the last minute of Friday: Senator Arizona Jeff Flake made an agreement to the FBI to arrange a weekly investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Legal Commission that he was absolutely sure Kavanaugh grabbed him with a drunk head and tried to strip off her clothes at high school graduation.
Kavanaugh said in his clergy confession that it was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The transfer was likely to be viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen's report.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually having problems with calculating the number of people who are looking at transfers in public administrations.
To compare, it is about as big a audience as football final tournament games or Oscar-sharing.
The Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC with 3,26 million viewers stayed in the other place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the trial.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After a statement made by a moderate Republican agency that he voted in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning, when he had fallen under the prosecutor's dictation, trying to go to the Justice Committee's meeting with an elevator.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was accused of being transferred directly to CNN.
"I stand right here, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he will tell the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said that his department issued the application and added that he had more to say at the Justice Committee's meeting before the lift was closed.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected the direct transmission several hours later when the Legal Commission had to vote to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate Assembly for the vote.
But Flake said that he would only do this in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, which the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake convinced partly a conversation with a friend of the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later discussion with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an effect as it was apparent that the Republicans would not receive the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump started an FBI investigation in connection with Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses the critics of Brexit in a political game
The Prime Minister accused the interview of the newspaper Sunday Times of those who judged the plans of his exit from the European Union, the "political game" with the future of Britain and the damage to national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview to the newspaper, whose front cover was Theresa May with the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on May so-called Brexit's cabe plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "without the brain".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the LSU player's murder.
The police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player with the death of Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in jail with a second-rate homicide charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the resistance between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported the TV channel WAFB belonging to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that the man confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer announced that a man's bail has been set at $350,000 (308 600.30).
East Baton Rouge's coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that says that a bullet wound caused death in the neck area.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Operations Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and the people living in the area for the assistance provided for in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
The LSU sports leader, Joe Alleva, thanked the regional law enforcement bodies for ‘circling care and justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
1,98 meters of man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
His last season's games were 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team has been "beaten" and "chopped" because of Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” said Wade.
Vulcan smashed ash over Mexico City
An ash exploding from a volcano called Popocatepetli has reached the southern parts of the city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disastrous Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans by ordering them to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again began action, which led to 183 cases of gas emissions and ash explosion within 24 hours.
The center vaulted several noises and vibrations.
The pictures shared in social media represented the front glasses of the car covered by ash in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in volcano activity in a 72 km south of the capital after 7,1 magnitude earthquake shaking in the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police encountered conflicts with the Separatists of Catalogue before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the confrontation of the protesters with the martial police. Thousands joined the opponential protests to celebrate the opposite vote of Cataloonia on resignation.
A group of masked separation fighters, who were refraining from the martial police, attacked the last eggs and powder colours, causing thick dust clouds to streets that are usually full of tourists.
Rüselusi also occurred later when the police had to use snoops to control the fights.
Several hours of "No forgetting, no forgiveness" were singing by the self-employers to collide with the oneness of the country's advocates who called "Like Spain".
According to the local press, 14 demonstrations of medical assistance received a slight injuries.
The tensions continue to be up in the area of independence one year later when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which the catalysts in favour of the separation indicated.
The voters overwhelmingly decided to benefit independence, although the election activity was low, because those who opposed the resignation ignored the vote extensively.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the vote in front of the region's voting departments, which led to violent collisions.
Independence parties had stayed on Friday night in front of the voting departments in order to avoid demonstrations supporting the national police.
However, the statements took place, but you had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a divorce demonstration with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope of seeing Cataloonia as independent.
“In the last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, the political parties supporting the independence of the Catalan have been difficult to maintain this year's action since a number of known leaders have either gone to exile or have been held in custody and are waiting for a trial to be held in the process of organising the referendum and subsequent independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records the protest to support the police with his mobile phone, said that the politicians of both sides were struggling.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans, who have been in prison since the previous year, announced that he will take part in the elections of the European Parliament next year.
“Abstention in the elections of the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the resignation of democratic values and the pressure statements of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: the man was arrested because the car was rammed in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car in Londonderry was repeatedly rammed by the house.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., according to British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was made to the gates and the building.
There was also a chance to put a bow in the direction of the car at some point.
The menga hit gives Livingston 1 to 0 wins in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston was backing the race.
The successful Livingston snatched the Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to another loss during 18 games when he's been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga hit turned out to be definite when Gary Holt lifted the level in seconds to Hibernian.
Gerrard will remain unwinded in the first league during this season and stands with the Hearts, which will be down on eight points next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will host the Euroliiga on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while Coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since the month before Kenny Miler was replaced.
Livingston loses the chance of a grudge against visitors
The Holt team should have been in charge a long time before the gate was hit, in so far as their straightforward playstyle caused any problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts fell in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to hit Craig Halkett's headwear over the gate.
The strangers slowly allowed Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems to guests in certain places.
And that's the way they hit the determinant gate.
Rangers gave up the free hit and Livingston had an opportunity to play the Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in it from the middle of the punishment area.
By then, the Rangers mainly held the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, so the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly once to protect the gate.
The Ranger Gateguard Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's hit and Lithgow blew sharply in Livingston's second teamwork.
The impacts were constantly reached in Livingston's penal zone and they were constantly kicked out of it. Two of them were driven away, one of them was for the Halkett Glenn Middleton replacement test and the other for touching the ball with the hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaron Stadium
The phenomenal effect and the result of Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the tires upwards with full expectations.
Their game style and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt must be respected for how he has chased the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, organizing an excellently organized protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back legs all the time the game.
But the Rangers didn't get much encouragement.
Regardless of their intermediate soundness under Gerrad’s leadership, this was limited according to the examples here.
Their last holding of the ball proved to be inadequate: the entry to the home side was only a procedure that could operate as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the central part of the table.
Contrary to Erdogan in Cologne
In Berlin, there were both smiles and a cloud of concern on Saturday (29 September) as the Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's contradictory German visit, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They are ignored in matters relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
In the city, the largest Turkish community is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by banning the assembly of 25 000 members in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of those who have expressed their minds against Erdogan, many of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German Government to host the Turkish President in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude of the guest is divided: some Turkish in Germany welcomes him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: a bicycle was killed as a result of an accident with a car
In London, a motorcyclist was killed.
A collision took place on the road to Deptford, near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the south-eastern part of the city by about 10:15 British summertime.
The driver stopped and the aid arrived to provide ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
A few months after the collision of the second bicycle crashed about two kilometers away from the day of the accident on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the bike escaped from the scene.
The London police said the authorities were involved in identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
At the event site, traffic is closed and buses are redirected; drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officers were injured in trouble
The prison office announced that six prison officials were injured in a very secure male prison.
At Worcestershire, Her Majesty Long Lartin prison, on Sunday at 09:30 a.m., after the British summer season, hasn't ended yet.
One wing of congenital affairs involving eight prisoners has been involved in the handling of experts' martial police officers.
Prison officials were treated for lighter face injury at the scene.
The press reporter of the prison service said: “Specially trained prison workers have been invited to solve the current case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, the responsible will be transferred to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was taken to hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
In October last year, however, the martial police were invited to prison to silence the serious disturbances in which prison officials were attacked with pool balls.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden attacks (the Oran will be useful to the southern regions)
The tropical low pressure does not often hit Arizona, but this is likely at the beginning of the next week when the raging hurricane Rosa moves across the southern desert, bringing the sudden threat.
The National Air Service has already arranged for sudden monitoring on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern Nevada, the southern part of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the remark, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on Monday with rainbows.
Phoenix’s National Air Service’s orientation: “After 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure levels in a radius of 32.86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 miles from the border of Arizona."
The most recent models of the national hurricane centre predict 5,08 to 10,16 centimetres of rain, which can reach the restricted areas of Arizonas Mogollon Rim to 15,24 centimetres.
The number of rains is probably 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres in other desert areas, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Woman, in limited areas, up to 10.16 centimetres.
The rains of Rosa may be a blessing for suddenly farmed areas, as the area is depleted in the drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainbows are likely to be useful as the drought is in South America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or largely the second category of droughts, weather.com reported.
Firstly, the hurricane Rosa Baja, California, crosses the peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest hurricane windmills of 6,43 kilometres per hour, is now 619,95 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 kilometres northwards.
The storm is exposed to the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, which is why it is slowing down a bit.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to reach the land of Mexico with the strength of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rains in certain mexican regions may be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja from California to Sonora’s northwest part can be expected to have rainbows with a total of 7,62 to 15,24 centimetres, reaching up to 25,4 centimetres,” said weather.com.
Rosa then heads to the north of the Mexican tropical storm, reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure that moves over Arizona and reaches the southern part of the Utah on Tuesday late evening.
“The main threat that follows Rosa or its consequences is very strong rain attacks in Baja California, Sonora in the northwest and the southwest of the United States in the desert,” said the National hurricane Centre.
These rains can cause life-threatening sudden and flood water in the deserts and paintings in mountain areas.

Trump said that Kavanaugh “were suffering” under the Democratic Party’s “fruit and anger”
“The support of the council Kavanaugh is a voice against the mercyless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump in his energy call Wheelingus in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “harred” during his appointment during the process of the Democratic Party’s “fruit and anger”.
Kavanaugh gave the Congress witnesses on Thursday, swinging sharply and emotionally back Christine Blasey Ford's charges, according to which a man attacked him severalty years ago when they were teens.
Also, during the hearing, he gave a statement of his prosecutions ford.
On Saturday, the President said, "America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh".
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most precious legal lessons of our time who have an unfaithful background in the public service," he said to the population supporting West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking at the same time about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
“ Five weeks have remained until one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
"This is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats were on a mission aimed at “to resist and hinder”.
The first main procedural vote on the application of Kavanaugh on the Senate floor is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the parental cNN of the Republican party leaders.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of dead is rising
At least 384 people died, and many were shouted when the giant waves broke into the beach after the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday at the beach festival in Palu City, when at the time of the jewelry, they struck six metres of waves on the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the road.
Tsunami followed a 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people did their work on the beach, not immediately escaped, becoming victims," said BNPB press reporter Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakartas at the press conference.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took cars, bars and houses with him, swept everything off the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved on the open sea at a speed of 800 km an hour before it got to the shore.
Some people climbed into trees to escape tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 centers.
Air photos published by the catastrophe agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The reconstructives in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In a region with 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Indonesia's Technology (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times higher than its own nuclear bomb dropped into Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city near the long and narrow lahe may have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as "deep" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead could be greater in the coastal area north of Past 300 km, called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
The notifications from Donggale “are completely incomplete and contain no information,” Nugroho said.
"In the region, over 300 000 residents live," said the Red Cross in its statement, adding that its team and volunteers are headed to the affected places.
"It's already a tragedy that could get worse," he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the City of Pal, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the beach while the warning was issued.
Amateur circumferences in social media can see a man on the upper floor of a building who warns panicly from the tsunami approaching people on the down street.
A few minutes later, the water salesman arrives on the beach, carrying houses and cars with him.
Reuters failed to confirm the correctness of the material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami resulted in a wide-ranging electric interruption which hindered the connection in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport located in the city was reopened for rescue works, remaining closed in other parts until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of people who died due to Indonesian tsunami increased by over 800.
That's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggale safely arrived in the city of Prayer, where they were hidden in the presentaways in their office courtyard, they saw the sights of their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said that you saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Although the aid forces were forcefully initiating disaster mitigation operations, some of the complained that workers of high-skilled foreign aid organisations were prevented from traveling to Pay.
According to Indonesia's rules, foreign funds, reserves and aid can only be sent if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a pressist of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can start adopting international assistance, but this state has not yet been declared."
When a second night arrived after the earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and families of the missing were still full of hope that their closest ones are these wonderful cases that make it easier for the birth of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer shelf.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was trapped next to her mother's body for two days.
The trainer Gendon Subandono trained two missing balloon guards for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of them who are trapped at the Roa Roa hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a slumber from the Senior,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke of how he desperately sent WhatsAppi messages to the competitors who were on the beach festival after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means that messages did not arrive,” he said.
Vargas took EUR 23 585.88 in Newport on the Levees during the execution of the bank automobile
On Friday morning, the thieves stole EUR 23 585.88 from Brink's employee in the Levees banking machine, published in a press release at the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptyed a bank machine in the entertainment facility and manufactured to bring more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
When a man acted, “the other man drove behind Brink's employee,” and stole a bag full of money for delivery.
The witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, writing a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on early persons will be asked to contact the Newport Police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper takes his new name Ye
Räppar Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday, when announced a change in Twitter, the man wrote: "Former Kanye West."
From 41, West has been called by the nickname Ye for some time and the man also used his name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his presentation is broadcasting Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled his concert with “sensitive drive”, said the author of the program.
In addition to the abbreviation of a man's current artist's name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance for him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most used word in the Bible, which means "you" there," said West earlier, discussing the name of the radio broadcaster Big Boy with his album.
“In this way I am you, I am us, it is us.
I changed my name from Kanye, meaning "this one," the name Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusing, and everything else.
The album is a more reflection of who we are."
Kanye West isn't the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
The JAY-Z previously cooperated with West has also used its name with and without the meaning fragment, with large and small letters.
The Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of blood attacks against students, the Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he would never use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “the military would never be used to control the Mexicans. ”
On October 2, 1968, the army attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people while all of Latin America were carrying on to confirm the left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said the donor and artificial intelligence manager Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US Government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US does not generally have a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year to be a new driver for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Twiceing the technical intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are acting in the interests of the next intelligence breakthrough," Lee said.
Double funding would double the probability that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence would be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC this week's interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the Managing Director of Sinnovation Ventures, which financed one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. Later he was a man at the Microsoft Research Board and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised the previous U.S. government technology competition as the Robotic Competition of the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“US scientists have to work hard to get money from the government,” said Lee.
"China is not the one who takes over the Arithians, they are the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate degree in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” said the man.
The Chinese Government published the next generation of technological intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Science Fund shares funding to people working in academic institutions, similarly to how the National Research Fund and other Government Authorities provide money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up a united centre of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions.
This month DARPA announced that AI Next started financing an initiative of two million dollars.
But the National Research Fund is currently funding over $100 million per year for research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, there has been no change in US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians will vote in the referendum on change in the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday's referendum on whether to change the name of the country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This would be a step which would also solve a decades of dispute with Greece, which has hindered the confirmation of the declarations of membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but opposers of nationals claim that the name would undermine the national personality of the Macedonian slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum, and the irregularity campaign has raised doubts about whether the election activity would achieve the 50% rate of participation that would be needed to hold the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU, in agreement with Greece?"
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid for Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, a 79-year-old who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The two-thirds of Parliament are required to change the name.
The National Election Committee said that at 13:00 no notice of irregularities is available.
However, only 16 percent of the elections were active compared to 34 percent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered electorates voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old, who voted in Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
On 30 September 2018, the Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, voted Strumica in the Macedonian referendum on a change in the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliamentary building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage, raising the chairs in front of the tents for those who ignored the referendum.
"We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want us to be adopted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get from European-Aasia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring more than 20% of unemployment into Macedonia the necessary investments.
“I believe that a large majority support the change of name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said "yes" would be "acknowledge of our future".
The results of the survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that 30-43% of voters intend to take part in the referendum, which are below the necessary electoral activity.
The Macedonian Telma TV survey announced that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said you would say yes.
The success of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the western policy of the government after the government took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton protection on behalf of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling penetrated Brighton's protection, ensuring that Manchester City 2-0 wins on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguero made it look like the gate hit on his 65th game mile came ridiculously easy.
Argentine attacker crossed the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated three Brighton protectors before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another guard before he ran through a number of players at the Brighton Penitentiary Border.
Then he hit the ball on his left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton gateguard Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
“Aguerol is a problem with the legs,” said manager of Manchester City to Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We said he'd play in 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the gate at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial success in Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got hit by the ball a few times before he drove Sterling away.
Sky Blues drove the ball back into the network just before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City plays the Masters League subgroup with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar Stadium Sinsheimis, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockie.
When the Nationals missed the final tournament games, there was no big reason for the new start.
Scherzer, a battle-bearing Scherzer, hopes to make a fall in Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only when Rockiesel, who runs a game in NL West, is still a chance to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed 5-2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, at least a yacht place, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“While we do not play for anything, we can at least try to know that playing in the atmosphere in Denver is probably higher than any other game that may await me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals haven't mentioned a open player yet, but they're supposed to tend to Scherzer's feed in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feed, made a warming donor and feed on Sunday on Thursday.
This Washington right-handed player runs from 18 to 7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of outlets 300 and its 220 2/3 for this season.
Trump's having an inspiration call in Western Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking at the same time about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime is one of the most important elections.
This is a major event in which I am not applying for, but I am actually candidates. Therefore, I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible group of democrats, and you will see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power using any means. You'll see their evil and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
Democrats are claiming to be deployed to “contravent and hinder”.
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats “anger, wicked, naughty, and lying."
He referred to the Democrat of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs to Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was shouted out loud among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, oh, what?
No, no, wait, it was one of the worst examples of the body language, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist party is no longer a great connection.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When my local Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of leiborist Members to whom they say you are not welcome, and all of this for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, from Parliament, received the same treatment because he was strongly opposed to anti-Judas.
In my case, I was condemned by the judges for not being consulted with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar to those of which Jeremy also had disagreement with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Leiborist Party Communication stated that “We would like meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
In most cases, the experience of my eight-year local Leiborist Members with the meetings of the General Assembly on Friday evening is exactly this.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be more “slick and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten than it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the different perspectives are not acceptable to the Leiborist Party, and for each opinion, they will be evaluated who are acceptable to the party's board.
It began immediately after Jeremy became the leader, a co-worker with whom I thought I would share similar political views, now expecting me to change my mind and take the views that I would otherwise never have accepted, whether it was a matter of national security or of the EU single market.
Every time I come up publicly, regardless of what I actually say, it follows condemnation in social media, by encouraging my re-invitation, by ignoring the party's policy and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I've been more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those co-workers who face sexual or racist abuse every day, but never sworn down.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a great community and that every "reliability" initiative or amendment of the electoral rules will become more narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and "it would be fine."
But that wasn't what I came to do in politics.
Since I joined the Leiborist Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which had left my great school room literally on the edge of the collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as a member of the local council and a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including in recent elections.
There is no way that no one in Nottingham East was confusing with my political positions or the areas of non-consultation with the local leadership.
For all those who promoted movements on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not want to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, it is not the only message I have meant to Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether they belong to the Leiborist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat or political consideration will stop me from acting in behalf of what I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: the invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have been struck somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun Tennent's first too.
They're now the only unleashed team in the top of the table.
After all, it was a high-level team of protection and better risk-taking, which led to the domestic team's victory, and coach Peter Murchie has the full right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested during games all the time and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: “The story of Ayrist, they used their options better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th game minute, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri a progress land, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, whose yellow card Warriors gave Melros the opportunity to perform a failed test.
Climo increased Ayri’s success countries with a penal strike immediately before the end of the half-life, reaching an individual event at the end of the half-time in favour of 17-5 Ayri.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which took over Baggo, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knotti, after which a man was taken away on the cancer. As the game continues, Ayr increased the country of success even further thanks to the Stafford McDowall's attempt sent by Climo.
Ayri's Executive Capt. Blair Macpherson was with a yellow card, but once again, Melrose's player paid Bruce Colvine's attempt to fail transmission after strong pressure.
However, the team playing at the homefield gathered back strength and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the line of punishment, MacPherson dropped the ball behind the progressive Ayrites.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game was continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's box and sent the side-defense Gregor Henry to go to the homefield with the team's fifth attempt.
Still Game's star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to take part in the hosting sector after it was discovered that a man was appointed director of a recognised restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvi in a known BBC TV series he writes and is acting with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that the forthcoming nineth season will be the last of the series and it seems Kiernan will make life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would like to enter Glasgow's "flexive restaurant business".
"Meri is ours": without the sea border Bolivia hopes that the court will open their way again to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags are floating above the buildings of the Agency.
To the Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the key point is: “Merry is our right.
It is our duty to restore it."
There is a memory of the coastline that was lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century in Bolivia, which is still alive.
These hopes are sometimes the highest for the last decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision to be taken by the International Court on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“The spirit of unity and peace is slow, and the state is naturally waiting for a good result,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A large number of Bolivians all over the country will look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide for Bolivia, after which Chile has been obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades in order to give its last independent way to the sea.
The Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales, who is awaiting a conflict of controversial elections next year, is much at stake in a Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the court is likely to not vote for Bolivia, or if it were, it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to dedicate the territory of Chile and it has provided that it does not identify the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court’s decision is taken only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that it was not a ‘complicated case’, said Chile’s international law expert Paz Zárate.
And distant from additional causes in Bolivia, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of access to sea has been abducted by the current Bolivian authorities,” said Zárate.
Moralese’s military beauty speech has lost all the remaining Chile’s goodness, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have never changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is the representative of Bolivia in Haagi, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was indispensable.
Monday will give Bolivia an "excellent opportunity to start a new era in the country's relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end the divisions of 139 years with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, uses the maritime issue to express political horror.
“Bolivia will never abandon its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"There is a chance to see that we have to get over the past."
North Korea said that no nuclear release will take place until the United States can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to review the promises made by the leaders of the competitors during the Singapore summit.
He comments at the time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, almost seems to reintroduce nuclear diplomas more than three months after the meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni, was held in Singapore.
According to Ri, it is a flood that the US continues to restrict and refuses to terminate the war with Korea to give up North Korea.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arms.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon a weapon that the State is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree with the second Kim and Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show brings to the viewer a series of massive headlines that will be brought to the buyers in their neighborhood shopping pools
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange top covers on stages during their summer season 2019, which blinded the fashion week in Paris.
High and unpractical hats are in the fashion of Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their legacy creatures to the musical openers.
Valentino’s top work was the overwhelming beige hat covering the heads of the models, which was decorated with a resemblance wide edge.
Other extremely large clothing items included scarboys, magic hats and even ananas, but their purpose is not to heat.
Thom Browne also showed the odd choice of masks, doing it exactly at the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were stitched mouths, so they recalled Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the creation reminded me of the diving costume with air pipes and glasses, while the other reminded me of the melted ice cream.
And if you continue with giant mourning, you're lucky.
Moegures predict that super-human heads can also reach the shopping streets near you.
High-sized hats come right behind La Bomba, a 60-inch shoulder hat seen in the head of all fames from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A largely unpractical hat - created cult brand engraved into social media sent to the musical opens another big piece — a beach sack of shoulders, which is almost as large as the bikini model that was carrying it.
The Tumeoranž raffia bag with raffian narms and white leather, was the top of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in Paris on the fashion week.
Luke Armitage of the Fames said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags next summer. Since the designer has had such a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore demand for extreme clothing items.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
Scotland's private schools have remained at the forefront of the academic top table and continued with the following outstanding exam results in 2018, which are reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students study the whole of Scotland, are represented by the Scotia Private School Council (SCIS), are trying to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
The aim of private schools is to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place of residence as world citizens.
As a educational sector capable of designing and implementing an adapted curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be known and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak a person in an understandable language, it comes to his head.
"If you talk to her in her native language, it gets into her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examinations, we see that the main ends of the tables are languages where the highest level of exams is among private schools.
Together, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high result of A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students became A, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choices of subjects are in private schools and other schools' curriculums similar to STEM (scientific science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, amongst the reasons why employers are difficult to find workers in free jobs, 17% of respondents did not have any language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly obligatory to prepare young people for their future work.
To the extent that more expected job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in the global world.
Regardless of the career choice made, the acquisition of a second language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens will immediately give a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
In 2013, more than 4000 adults from the United Kingdom have been interviewed by YouGov, 75 percent of respondents do not speak well enough of any foreign language to discuss this. The only language with two-digit percentages was French by 15 percent.
Therefore, funding for language training at present is important for children today.
Knowledge of many languages, in particular the countries with an emerging economy, will give children a better opportunity to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in every school.
A large number of schools focus more on classical languages, while other schools teach languages that are deemed to be the most important in the United Kingdom for the years 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Despite the benefit of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between different languages taught by experts in their field.
Scotland's private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and provides children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring to them.
It can no longer be denyed that languages in the global business environment are crucial for the future of the country, and that is why it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots a choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Fascinating admirers don't have to wait to see LeBron James make their debut in Lakers in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing a Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of his toys is still to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell's orientation that James is likely to play as a number of minutes.
After the training last week, James was asked about his plans regarding Lakers’ schedule for the six-game season.
“I do not need my career at this stage of pre-semester games to warm myself,” he said.
Trumpi Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch his campaign event series tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
This is a campaign event scheduled for the first week of Trump from five, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the approval vote is pending until Trump chooses to appoint the Supreme Court for a free place, he will try to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control after the vote in November.
What time is Trump going on tonight's campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place this Saturday evening on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 East Coast Time.
Trumpi Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed online through YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about the meetings of the Supreme Court's Officer Brett Kavanaugh this week that became tense in relation to sexual abuse charges, while the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign events is to help reconcile the Republicans who face complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trumpi’s campaign leader said that the purpose of these five events next week is to “enhange volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, mediated Reuters.
"Inspection of the Congress is so important for the President's agenda that Trump will go to the fast season of election campaigns as many countries as possible," said Reuters to the Trumpi campaign pressmaker who did not wish to mention his name.
This evening's campaign event, which is planned to take place at Wheelingo at Wesbanco Stadium, can bring in supporters "Ohiost and Pennsylvania and receive a reflection in Pittsburgh's media", reported the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, this is another time when Trump visits West Virginia over the last month. This is a state where the man received more than 40 percent of the voters in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Western Virginia republician senate candidate, who is on the basis of the interviews.
“For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results,” said Politologist at the University of Western Virginia Simon Haeder, announced Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States is nerved, keeping hopes before Sunday alone games high
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday afternoon games were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
A diversified turning point pendel is a perfectly devised concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this here.
So, where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led with six points that have now become four, so I think it can be considered a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear because it is driven by four points and there are still 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they don't have enough winds in sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them received three points of four.
Spieth has been struggling for both wings and grinds and shows an example.
These winning cubes from the throat grew louder in every circle by hiding a defining bug that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were in the ground with two.
His bet that won on battle 15 sent a similar call that showed the man's belief that the Americans are not out of competition yet.
"You just have to focus on playing and worrying about your fight," said Spieth.
That's the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have Ryder Cup on undeniable stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange, but the loved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogeyes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday nine in the morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into a noisy crowd, as back there, strengthens the opinion that players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that if the sun passes over to Le Golf National, there is no chance of the most famous player of Europe's victory as Fleetwood or Molinari.
Prefered both simultaneously to different holes.
But talks about Europe's glory are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia this morning with a four-ball hero, a quick job when a man was put in a couple of Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine duplicate the Spanish and the Sweden in such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
There's no one to help you out on Saturday.
Four balls and pair games are extremely clever to look close to the relationship between the couples, the advice to each other, the lack of advice and the way to change in a moment.
Europe has so far played a better team and has been leading a strong progression for the last day, but this fourth session showed that the US team is in a fight with a few, especially Americans.
Europe is in charge of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will succeed in Ryder Cup on the last day, leading 10 to 6 in front of the United States after Saturday's four balls and pair games.
The excellent duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two triumphant tiger Woods to raise their previous score to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European Party, who contributed two years ago to the maintenance of the lost cup in Hazeltine, ruled after the failure in the American half of the morning in four balls, winning a series of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in a pair game, winning two games, but they couldn't compensate for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points for Sunday 12 single games to keep a cup.
Fleetwood is the first starter in Europe who won four points in a row, together with Molinari, who after this so-called Molliwood, are the other couple who have won four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau water more surely: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed an accidental shine, but now lost his 29 four balls and a pair game 19, receiving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four balls in the morning, came back with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the first and third position of the world.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The triumphant winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They received a four-ball solid victory over 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, later returning and winning in a pair game Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, losing two opening doors.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has returned from a four-point deficiencies, going to single games, although as owner Furyk's half-cock needs only five to preserve.
While being in the second place for two days, it seems after Sunday’s counterattack that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that 'not in any case' they do not make themselves unanimously armed because of lack of confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN that the continuation of restrictions intensified their innocence against the United States of America and that the State will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual meeting of the world organisation that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of the nuclear test site and the promise not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we can't see that the United States would have answered it," he said.
"The United States of America lacks untrusted security and, in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves as the first."
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea in relation to the opposition of Washington to the "standing" approach to nuclear-related non-nuclear-arming, on the basis of which North Korea will be rewarded when it takes progressive steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear-arm-related refusal, as has been done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump on 12 June at the first summit between the President of the United States and the Head of North Korea in Singapore, when Kim allowed to move towards the ‘renouncement of Korean peninsula’ and Trump granted security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has requested the official cessation of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States calls for "first abandonment of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their target forcedly, even against the declaration of ending of war," Ri said.
“The fact that our limitations are pushing us on their knees is a dream for people who do not know us at all.
The problem is, however, that the continuation of restrictions will deepen our insecurity."
Ri did not mention the plans of Kim and Trump's second summit, which the US leader in the United Nations earlier this week stressed.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between three Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae during the last five months and added: “If the issue of nuclear weapons would be one of the parties to South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a congestion.”
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the North Korean missiles turned to the United States continent after Mr. Paha President Trump called Kim’s suicide mission “radiation unit”.
Last year, North Korea saluted the entirely threatening Trump in the United Nations for Kim's sky to take steps towards being unarmed, but added that there is still a lot to be done and that the restrictions must remain in force until the North Korea's nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he lacked a timetable for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years, or five months - it is not important.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward for the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the restrictions of the Security Council must continue to force and fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the abolition of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the limits applicable to North Korea by attempting to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After the meeting with the July Pyongyang, he said that progress has been made after which North Korea only condemned the “gangsterlike demands” within a few hours.
North Korea allowed the missiles and nuclear complex to be dismantled at the Moon meeting this month if the United States were to implement "the corresponding measures".
He told him that Kim had told him that under "the appropriate measures" that meant the security guarantees allowed in Trumpi Singapore and the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, the Harvard University offers a new course where students need more sleep to fight a growing aggressive culture, where they learn in caffeines through night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basic facts of caring for themselves.
According to the designer of this course, a sleeping doctor at Harvard Medical School and Professor Charles Czeisler of Brigham and the Women's Hospital, this is the first kind of professor in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he spoke about how sleep disturbances affect learning.
“ At the end of this one girl came to me and asked: ‘Why don’t they talk to me about it just now, in my last year of school?’
He said that no one ever told him the importance of sleep - it created me in the ass," he explained to Telegraph.
The course that first came to the curriculum this year explains to the students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting results and also contribute to their overall well-being.
At Harvard Medical School, the professor of psychiatrist and the health director of the university, Paul Barreira said that the university decided to take the course program after it was found that the students were in a serious sleep in the work week.
The hours-long course covers a number of cross-action tasks.
In one part, a picture of the common landscape is presented, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleeplessness affects sports results and the importance of the practice of sleeping.
The second section explains how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The City of the University map, along with the counteracting symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily practice.
“We know that this does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that night learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure for students mean rather that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
"Securing a long-quality sleeping garden should be a secret weapon of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "This even helps against weight gain, because sleeplessness makes the brain hungry, making a person hungry constantly."
From California, 19-year-old, chemical and physical biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to set up a course, having participated in one of his classes in the previous, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, he would like all graduates to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competing authority.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to set the alarm bell for both sleep and awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and the "blue light" of the LED light, as it may damage their daily rhythm and cause problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrad's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game when Dolly Menga's hit, sent by Steven Gerrard, brought 1-0 wins to Livingston.
The Ibrox party hoped to get his first guest victory since February, when the 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but the Gary Holt team only caused Gerrad's second loss as a leader in 18 games, leaving eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership guide from Hearts.
Menga hit his gate seven minutes before half-life and the Rangers' poor preparedness couldn't recover from it.
So Rangers falls on the sixth place, Livingston rises to third place, staying down on Hibernian with only one gate.
For the Rangers, the problems may not have ended yet because their assaultman Calum Spence needed a head wound treatment after he was hit by an apparently lost object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to Ayrist and Betfred Cupi's semi-final.
But at the same time, Holt went along with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step.
Rangers may have been the most dominant visit, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate at the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half-protector didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free hit was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to make only a wide-arm hit in the back of the post.
The Rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he met Steven Lawless on 15th game mile, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
During the first half, Rangers managed to target only two strikes, but the former Ibrox Gateguard Liam Kelly did not have any concerns about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although Livi’s 34 - minute opening might have ruined the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep hard performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and picked out Menga who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted during the break, changing Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost paid off when the extremism player split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly shattered to stop his place.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The dead side could have promoted its leadership at the end stage, but McGregor stood firmly by stopping Jacobs before Lithgow hit a large corner.
The Deputy Ranger Glenn Middleton again applied for a penal strike when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson was not satisfied again.
Almanah: Geiger Counter Inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morningu Almanahh: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and the day when Germany was born the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to a device known as Geiger's counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger's counter also became a popcultural platform as in the 1950 'Coronado watches' film, where in the main parts they were seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When carrying these ear valves, it is possible to hear the pod of the atoms that have been removed from mineral radioactivity."
Evans: “Don't you tell me, it's just hanging!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cheating cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cheating cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches you how to feel the immune system as part of the treatment of cheating cells
The method includes the taking of immune cells from the patient and the modification of their cells in the laboratory
Then they will be able to produce a common protein for many cancers and they will be injected back
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
In one woman treated with a vaccine teaching the detection of petrol cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to obtain a “snack” protein that is common for various HER2 cancers, and then these cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “We have a very promising vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 “conducts the growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and cholectal cancers.
A similar approach has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia where patients are taken immune cells and instructed to target cancer cells.
Kanye West started with Trumpi's supportive tribe, carrying SNL directly to the MAGA hat.
It didn't go very well.
Sending Saturday Night Live at the studio, Kanye West, a degrading whistle cream, after his confusing speech, in which he praised President Donald Trumpi of the United States and announced his application to the same post in 2020.
After that evening his third song, which was called Ghost Town, and where he was wearing a hat with a letter of Make America Great, he began to play against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
"I have spoken so much to white people who ask me, "How do you like Trump, is he racial?"
"If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood celebrity made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of Judges on the alleged sexual violence of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go out, West's noise scanners were loaded into a comic Chris Rock's social media.
It's still unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West's post.
He also complained to the audience that he had a pretty difficult relationship with his hat.
“They fooled me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, the hat in the head.
They fooled me!
And then they say that I have drowned in the place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I'll put on my Superman bowl because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments fired the viewers at least two times and seemed embarrassed by the SNL team. According to Variety, one person published: “The whole studio was deadly. ”
West was introduced to the show at the last moment for Ariana Grande's replacement because the singer's ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller was dead a few days earlier.
West amazed many of the songs I Love it, which he looked like a bottle of Perrier at the time of his presentation.
West received support from the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who inspired: “To one brave soul, let’s see that JULGES APPLICABLE FINANCIALLY.”
But the escort of Karen Hunter's orientation that West was just “the one who he is, and it is absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decided to reward MITTE (to buy my music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) someone who, in my opinion, believes and disseminates the world view that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper in Twitter announced that he changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West.”
He's not the first singer to change his name, following Diddy, who's known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, the rapper Snoop Dogg has entered the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly left music legend Prince, who changed his name as a symbol.
Murder prosecution of Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man was charged with a murder attempt after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the case occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast's magistrate court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewed.
The celebrity of the Troons game Kit Harington does not approve the masculinity of the bend
Kit Harington is known for his sword-sparking role as Jon Snowina HBO in a violent medieval fantasy game in the Troons.
But an actor (31) drops the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles in the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be harsh.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something has gone wrong" and raised a question of how to solve the masculinity problem of the stunt #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) of his Troonic game, acknowledged that this problem needed attention.
"I personally feel pretty strong right now that we have gone wrong with maleism," he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, in relation to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that the rising of the maskulinity of the beat is partly guilty of television, because there are supermanent figures.
He continued: “What is contemporary and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys a feeling that they must be just like when they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the bigger issues of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has been wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that after the end of the series the next summer, none of the Trojans will be involved in the game, saying that he is “one side with his battlefields and horses. ”
Since November, Kit Sam Shepardi will be involved in reviving True West, talking about a story about a filmmaker and his robbery brother.
An actor recently announced that he considered meeting with his wife Rose as the best thing about the Troons game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played an award with Emmy in the fantasy series of Ygritte, Kit's character manager Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDs: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have arisen from sex, changing the past.
HIV was apparently spread in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV had declined to almost zero, confirmed by Chinese health officials at the Yunnan province conference.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100 000 per year.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem of the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Due to the old-fashioned values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men having sex with men will finally marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the GOC has allowed the use of general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys the leakage of the GOP senator's data, saying that this is "hazardous lies" and "consult theories"
On Saturday, the US representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted the personal data of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by “ultra-parallel” trolls and their websites.
“Valles, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahh).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it had been posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel with regard to the claims of sexual overturn against the Tribunal's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundt and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was related to the Waters office and issued the information of a member of the staff member under Waters, reported Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” continued Waters.
“My employees whose personality, personal data and safety are under threat because of their fraudulent and false claims do not in any way be liable for this information leakage.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters' statement was quickly numbered on the Internet, including one of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is due to anger," wrote Fleischer.
“It indicates that he has a emotion that is not appropriate to a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they must not get angry.
They can't be thrusty.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused by the critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is candidate for Waters during the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“Telling if it's true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned ‘the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding their deceitful claims’.
"We are all doing so to find out criminals," he continued, "and to put them legally responsible for all their actions that are destroying and dangerous to all my employees."
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Understanded Rowan Atkinson Spy-Parody
It is now customary that the meanings of Brexit are searched in all new British films, and it seems particularly appropriate to revive Johnny English with Johnny English in 2003.
Is it humorous to joke about yourself on how foolish we are clearly in the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, an incompetent rubber face, has been allowed to do things once again in his handful manner - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English film territory.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his odd presentation, recalls a little Clouseau, a little Bean and a little character who gave a tone of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mysterious Atkinson, once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, which leaves itself alone in chaos.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE film.
I liked Johnny English helicopter approaching when he wore medieval iron rings and helicopter tits for a moment against the helicopter.
A gift from Atkinson is shown to make a physical comedy, but humor seems less important and strangely excessive, especially as "severe" spy movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible also provide self-confidential comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me Johnny English's deliberate adventures are not so inherent and focused than atkinson's dark movies Beanina.
Today, there is a eternal presumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has penetrated the UK’s top secret spy network by exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thus creating a major disappointment to the local agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and distressed person who suffers under the burden of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson does this greatly for Teresa-May, but in the script there is not much to work on.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a proud institution, giving secret lessons about being a secret agent: here is a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock Spider School.
English will be returned to the Whitehalli for emergency notification and will be rejoined to his former long-term partner, Bough, who will be replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine captain, where the actor Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of his Majesty's secret service, are re-enacting with Olga Kurõlenko's corps of a beautiful femme fatal to Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the arm of a carismatic engineering billionaire, which claims that he can solve all the British computer problems: unhappy Jason Volta, who is playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their jant odysia: hiding as waitresss, they put fire on the French restaurant; they create chaos, hilling secretly Volta's luxury hunts on board; and English launches a real order when they try to use the virtual reality main set to explore the insideness of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and stormful as it is, the whole thing is on the side of children's TV makeup.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English movies, I was thinking: does the British film industry really not have Rowan Atkinson to play such a role that would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies the drafting of the plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party has considered a rotating plan, which provides that the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party wishes that the company's bosses forward the savings generated through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them one more day free.
That's how employees would have a three-day weekend, but they'd get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would be appropriate for the party's economic agenda and thus it is intended to be plucked for the benefit of workers.
The working week has been approved at the Congress of the Trade Union so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the working party said to The Sunday Times: “The review of the draft will be made known before the end of the year.
"This is not happening overnight, but the Thursday working week is an effort that is compatible with the party's approach to balancing the economy, both for workers and for the party's overall industrial strategy.
The working party is not the first to support such ideas because the Green Party also allowed a Thursday work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this effort is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The press reporter of the Labour Party announced: “The four-day work week is not a party policy and the party will not discuss it.”
Vice-President John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of a socialist turning in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to withdraw power from the “prefaced leaders” and “profit-servants”.
Assistant Chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders of aquatic companies may not recover their entire shareholding because the Working Party could make "decreasing" with regard to the misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the management of the company and to create ownership funds to give 10% of private companies' equity capital to employees instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The investigation of the charges brought by the FBI against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the conclusions of the Bureau could affect the termination of support for Republican senators.
In the Sunday interview, the Chairman of the 60 minutes, Scott Pelley Republic Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I'd go to the interrogation. I said I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the prosecutions came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, sure and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be sparkling.
“I’m sure of my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it can only be changed in a bombing,” he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know Brett denied it vigorously," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he has mentioned could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the global Citizens Festival and has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
On Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival will organise an annual music event with enormously impressive fame and the same impressive goal: to lose the world of poverty.
Now the seventh time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real objective of the event, which is the ending of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project Global Poverty Project. It is an international advisor group that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), concert attendants had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their objective of poverty eradication.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when it has been 12 years to achieve their objective?
Is the idea to give people a free concert is a real way to convince them to act, or is it just another clicking error where people feel that they do something important by signing an application online or squeezing?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have registered more than 19 million “actions” by attempting to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than 37 billion dollars of commitments and policies affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to the 390 commitment and the notification resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds guaranteed have so far had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership between investors and executives in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "to help children to exploit all the capabilities", allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help stop the country's under-treatment after receiving more than 4700 snacks from Global Citizens.
“In support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can transform subtle nutrition into a historic footnote of social injustice,” said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition to the crowd of Tracey Ullman during the London Concert in April 2018.
The Group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities, which invited the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced the financing project of The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children who need nutrition intervention.
In answer to one of the FAQs on their website asking, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult way - sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face major civil rights and anti-Apartheid movements, we are sure of our success because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few performers who are performing this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy's "guard" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister of Interior
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington can use its Navy as necessary to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, by the US Minister for Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it works at the request of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern European stomach,” he said.
And the official says there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has this opportunity through our Navy to ensure that maritime lines are open and, where necessary, blocked in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was turned to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit company, which represents the voice of the US "energy Consumer".
He went to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, boosting and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements will come at a time when the Government of Trumpi is responsible for increasing the export of natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to reject the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trumpi said transformed Berlin into a ‘vange’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's acute opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of explosive and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak at the meeting in Moscow, the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US attitude has been reversed by Germany, who has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
“I am a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Union (BDI), after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering the candidate in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was seriously considering candidates for president during the interim elections.
At the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the weighting of his application.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it also covers the first lady," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I am seriously considering candidates for president."
Warren also evaluated President Donald Trump’s activities in the wildhouse, saying that he “will lead the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published a criticism towards Trump and the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday Warren: "We naturally need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own electorates do not think that he should apply in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts considered that the senator should not be candidate.
32% supported such an application.
The survey showed more support for the candidateship of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported potential candidates and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democrat names, which were discussed in the context of possible candidates for 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, Vermont.
Biden said that it was officially decided by January, announced by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump at the meeting of Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent monthly recruitment after September in Iraq.
He was arrested Monday night in the case of domestic violence, and he was prosecuted.
"What my son is going through when he comes back, I can connect myself to other families who know the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning," he told the audience at the meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa Okhamas.
Palin called on his son to be arrested in the "elevent room" and said in connection with his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back as a deported, they come back to think of whether there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other military have given to the state."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Dan Bennett of the Wasilla Police Department said he was accused of domestic violence against the women, of domestic violence, of intervention and of possession of a gun in a drunken state.
The 18 State and the Columbia region challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge for a new US policy, which prohibits asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 countries and the region submitted a brief statement of court friends to support the call for policy on asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v Sessions suitis, submitted by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August, has not been published.
The woman said that her co-rapporteur, "and his violent gangboys", abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace's supportive national lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal of Migrants of 2014 which allowed immigrants to escape from domestic violence without documents.
Karl Racine, the Columbia Principal Attorney General, said in the Friday statement that the new policy "respects for decades of national, Union and international law".
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a requirement violates this principle,” stated a brief statement by the judiciary.
The Advocates also argued in a brief statement that the ban on immigrants' entry would harm the US economy, saying that they would be likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘optimize the necessary labour force’.
In June, the DG Jeff Sessions ordered the Immigration Tribunals to no longer give asylum to the victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear in connection with the opinion of a race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or political group,” said Sessions in its Communication of 11 June.
The asylum was never intended to mitigate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertaining Rescue Operations Appointment where the deaths have doubled in the fight against survivors
The situation was increasingly threatening for the survivors.
“The situation is extremely tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his fever in a small boy-lipped Palu in the city evacuation center.
“In every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough clean water."
The residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out the flooded things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnetic earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including the broken back and shoulder armed Dwi Haris, rested outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were still treated under the field because of severe post-recession.
The tears filled his eyes when he recalled how a strong earthquake shaken his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
“Took more time to save yourself.
I think I was ruined against the wall," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming to help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're not in danger."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "cleaning with ads and ads"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four pages of advertisement on the mutual benefit of US-China trade under daily news, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing to use American press to disseminate propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump referred to the addition paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the Iowa state's largest tirage in the newspaper - after China was accused of intervention in the elections of the United States of America on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections meant what the U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's enlarged campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common that foreign governments make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where import tariffs are adjusted.
The countermeasures in the PRC at the beginning of the Tariff War were intended to be caught by States such as Iowa exporters because they supported the parties of the Republic of Trumpi, have been explained by Chinese and US experts.
The US Ambassador in China and the former Governor of Iowa, as well as the largest Chinese agricultural products exporter Terry Branstad, said that Beijing affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the article on Sunday Des Moines Register: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing the ads in our free press.
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses American precious freedom of speech and free press practice, putting its paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand, there are only limited votes in the Beijing street kiosk and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have on a worrying economic direction, given that the media is under the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say what the newspaper was.
Analysts warn the Republicans to transfer women's electorates before the interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasko
While many Republicans are waiting for and defending the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a retreat during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in ceiling and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Professor Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at the University of Syracuse, published on Saturday in the article The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the last minute on the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm down the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said the Moveo Group’s senior advisor and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC’s newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators “November is coming” reiterated in their statements at the Senate hall, because the Republicans who supervised the Committee of Judges decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidateship, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic ind and internal indignation will be out of schedule,” said Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst.
“People say that it is already high, that is true.
However, it may be higher, especially among the outermost female voters and the younger electorates of 18-29, who do not like the president and often refuse to vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, which described his claims on sexual attacks against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts predicted a retreat when the Republicans would move forward with their confirmation.
“It has become very confused for GOP,” said the former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"This is not only about the vote of the Commission, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," Priorities, the United States (the group that helps to choose the democrats), led Guy Cecil to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided, who believe after the witnesses Ford and who Kavanaugh, but a little more in support of the first.
The new survey of YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were sure or likely to believe in the Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they were sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh probably lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30% thought about the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is investigating the claims currently made by Ford and at least one of the other accusations of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian announced.
Ford confessed to the Senate Committee of Judges last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor intends to start a new internet that will squeeze the breasts with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web Inventor, launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
The Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that Inrupt's goal is to "government of the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the start company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
It may include contact lists, mission lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company calls it "to give personal powers through data".
According to the company manager John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring sources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
At present, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some of the developers hired to work on the project under the contract, and the voluntary coding community.
From this week onward, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the Inrupt website's tools.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not speak with “Facebook and Google, whether to introduce a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In the post published in Medius on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next age of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A clergy monument crossed by Victoria in World War I was opened
The only church that got baptized in Victoria during World War I celebrated the 100th anniversary of his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought out his honor on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he died through the sniper's bullet and didn't know he had received the highest British army's honor.
Her two grandsons opened a monumental stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons Michael Vann said it would be "genially symbolic" if the stone would be opened exactly 100 years after the grandpa's prized fight.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 “through very thick fog and rifles and bullet guns. ”
Later, he rushed to the assault line and moved on with the "greatest galancing" before he rushed to one of the shooters alone, and three opponents spooked.
Colonel Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, when the war ended only a little more than a month.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather was “something that I know I can never repeat, but that I will always be grateful for.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a parade led by a conscientious youth band in Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that he has “a great honour to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of many people shows that the true hero is able to be evaluated.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to watch up all night, but you only saw the Duck Peppa.
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but this basic event will never be shown to you.
San Jose's match included 13 battles, including six main cards, and it was shown in the UK on channel 5 in direct transmission all night.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were ready to stick their breasts with each other, the UK viewers kept their mouths on the screen, because Pőrsas Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not excited, especially those who had stayed awake until early hours to see this battle.
One fan described the shift in Twitter to the children's comics as "sick joke."
“It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the programme of children,” explained Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice-President of Bellator, on marketing and communication issues when the transfer was requested.
""The Flesh Peppa, yes."
President Scott Coker said that they were going to work on their schedule to take more account of the UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about the reproducing, I think we can solve this problem in the future," said Coker.
“But when it's 6:00 a.m. in the morning of Sunday, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth texts, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical alert.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
Instead of six fights - as we usually do - we tried to offer more to the fans, and we just went over in time.
This is exactly the situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low-valued" in connection with sexuality.
Tom Daley, the Olympic winner, says he grew up feeling that he's less valuable than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until high school went, that "all aren't like him."
Participating Lauren Laverne Radio 4 in Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Being a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games by giving the feeling that it was no longer so important.
A regular long-term escort, Kirsty Young, was supposed to take a few months off due to his disease.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that she felt less valuable when she grew up than others, because she wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “To this day these are the feelings that I am not worthy and that I feel different, I have given power and strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," and he didn't disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double pronx-olympic winner has become a highly assessed leader of the LGBT campaign, using its appearance of the National Community Games this year in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he's talking about it because he's lucky he can live openly without consequences and he wants to give hope to others.
Triple World Champion said that the love of a man - the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "was a surprise."
Daley married her 20 years old Oscar winner last year, but she said that the difference between age has never been a problem.
“When you live so much when you were young,” he went to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – then it was difficult to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and horns.
In June, a couple became parents, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all prospect" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal," he said.
“But you know, there are much more important things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal has Robbie."
His son was named by his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after the diagnosis of the brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Daddy, you can't sit in the front row, because you're gone by the time you're gone," he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley won a bronze at the Olympic Games in 2012.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the crowd of home in the Olympic Games, this is not a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song option - Heather Small's Proud - that helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still causes him chicken skin.

Mickelson was removed from the form on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to fix his form to avoid the unhappy verstapost.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at the event, has been removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk to a Saturday pair and a four-ball.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as he has often been for the United States, a five-fold winner divided his day into two, being a stimulant and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the directest hitter, not even at the top of his career, is not suitable for the 48-year-old especially to play narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long tough track is punishing constantly lost hits.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, at his ninth competition, with the precise British Open Master Francesco Molinar, who has joined the forces with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans who are at the beginning of 12 single games start on fire with four points, Mickelson's competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much to add.
“He fully understood the part of today, he poured me on my shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said that he was ready for tomorrow,” added Furyk.
“He is very confident.
He's a fame and he's given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it went, and we had to choose this way.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes from Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most played player in Ryder Cup's games.
It could celebrate the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never answered his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losers and seven victories, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team a further spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, cheerful, funny, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week, and it was nice to see it.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn knows that a great state of success may soon disappear.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows of his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup's last day at the beginning of single games can easily become a unpleasant experience.
The Danish came to the public at the 1997 Valderrama competition, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, five-point progressions were held before the Americans, but it was drastically deteriorated when it reached the final line, only resulted in 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won, it came very close,” said the picture Bjorn after Class of 2018 win 5 : 3 Friday and yesterday with success at 10 : 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the whole team that it might happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It hasn't ended until you have the points written.
We have a goal of winning the cup, so let us focus on it.
I've been telling you all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who are our opponents - the world's best players."
Being pleased with his players in this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I will not rush in things.
Tomorrow is a whole new obstacle.
We'll read personal work tomorrow, so it's something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you're being tested as a golfer.
It's a message you have to send to the players - give yourself the best thing tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's gonna have to go and do it himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players work better personally than with counter players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received from four points three.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's team before becoming a part of the loss when Europe defeated Medinah's miracle.
“I remember every damn word,” she said as an answer to it when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged her players to put all of her game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start on fire like Brookline and like Medinah.
When the moment goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average races.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the square in a way that we feel it can be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to run the race and he is the best match with Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as well as the best Europeans in other races.
"I put my boys in that line because I think we're well covered," said Bjorn about the choice of his single games.
Germany's new military ship delayed again
The German Navy’s latest high-speed sailor should have been introduced in 2014 by substitution of the old-aged Cold War war warships, but this is not happening before the next year due to injured systems and snowball increased costs, reported by local media.
The introduction of a new ‘Rheinland-Pfalzi’ Steering Ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg class has now been postponed on the first half of 2019, according to the military press releases published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transfer problems did not make this ambitious project easier for the destiny.
Four Baden-Wuerttember ships, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, replace the old-aged Bremen-class high-speed sailors.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aeroplanes and ship missiles and some concealing technologies such as reducing radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important opportunities include longer maintenance periods - the latest emergency sailors should be able to be shipped out of a port of home for up to two years.
However, persistent delays mean that high-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - are already ageing at the time of entry into service.
The unlucky F125 fast sailor appeared on the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blhm & Voss Shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilding.
There was little information about the reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware shortcomings" which made the warship unfit if they had been used in the battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the older Bremen class high-speed sailors.
It also became clear that the ship is considerably overweight, which reduces its performance and restricts the capacity of the Navy to include future innovations.
The 7000-tonne ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is probably twice the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the price of the whole project, including the training of the team, will also become a problem.
It has been said that this will reach EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the newer high-speed sailors become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of the German Maritime Corps is decreasing.
At the beginning of the year, Chairman Hans-Peter Bartels of the German Parliament's Defence Commission recognised that the Navy has actually “extinued the ships that are eligible for departure”.
The official said that this theme has grown as a snowball in time, because old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttember's high-speed sailors could have joined the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
The purpose of a new study in the mountain of Scotland is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give a new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future protective measures.
In the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross, the researchers of Scotland National Trust monitor the usual and sopranipipes, as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main sites of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of leather coaches and the activities of the species.
A map of habitats and a report will then be created to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Consultant Rob Dewar hopes that the results show what habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of timber and the best way to preserve forests for leather and other related species.
In Scotland and across the United Kingdom, the bats Surgery has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting their habitat and loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as are flying papers and chemical processing of some construction materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful to catch the harvest than their eyes.
They are using complex kaja-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Over 270 historical buildings throughout the country, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance NTS are very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, surveys and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has even established the first and only special Leather Reserve in Scotland in Threave in Dumfrie and Galloways, where eight of the ten bats in Scotland live.
Asset manager David Thompson says this area is a perfect territory for them.
"We have a big area in Threave for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees, and a great place to live.
But there is still much to discover about the bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand better what they need."
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance in real estate, since the unwanted destruction of one place of childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and the killing, interference or destruction of them are illegal.
Scotland Officer Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know a lot of our species and how their surgeons feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while lawyers intend to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected rape charges on him as a "debt", saying that people "will want to advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the charges published by Der Spiegel of the German newspaper.
The attacker in Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayor in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has allegedly paid EUR 330 643,10 for women not to talk about that incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
Turning into Instagram's direct video, his 142 million trackers after the charges, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be “bone news”.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
Today's the wrong news," said five times the winner of Ballon d'Ori to the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to appeal to the court of Der Spiegel in connection with ‘unacceptable suspicion of privacy’.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player is asking for compensation for “the cause of moral damage, which is likely to be one of the most difficult violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case took place in a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, June 2009.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayor were allegedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped on the basis of the documents submitted by Nevada, according to Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged case and told him that he was a "99 percent good man", one percent of whom he's failing.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed some sexual relations, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and photographed injuries in the hospital, but later he agreed to an outside solution because he was afraid of "management" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says that she's trying to reject the solution because the alleged case continues to have her trauma.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to the giant Juve with EUR 100 million in connection with the transaction to Italy.
Brexit: UN may repent for the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would ‘between it forever’ if it would lose its position as the world's driver of the car industry after Brexit, said the business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota U.S. had told BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production in a factory near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need an agreement,” said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cross-border stops without the Brexit agreement could be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the production process in our factory," said Burnaston Toyota, Managing Director Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared to leave the EU without an agreement, concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of the Brexit Agreement.
Toyota production line operates as necessary where spare parts come from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border which, according to the industry, may cause delays and deficiencies.
Toyota would not be able to store more than one day in its Derbyshire factory, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations has been "calibrated precisely to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will enable what we want, not only to make use of the current success, but to take advantage of all the opportunity,” he said to the BBC Radio 4 broadcasts today.
“The evidence not only of Toyota, but also of other producers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and finally pay jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the representative of the Unite trade union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that if jobs disappear, they will not return.
The Government Press Officer said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
A meeting with Donald Trump's major contributions to the DG Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of the Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who examines the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the prevention of the President's possible justice.
If Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General and thus threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's rumors have been lit for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of interrogation tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, reporting that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was reported on Thursday, then in New York with the United Nations.
Trump said that he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid confrontation with the Senate Committee on Judges, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave lessons.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate's vote.
The Trumpi pressman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday's news-tech Fox News.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been specified, this may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Ambassador Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information hours was not due to the inclination of TV journalists, although he added: “I am not opposed to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President makes more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
The information hours continue, Sanders confirmed, but “when the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot, and you have seen how we have done this in the last few weeks, so this will take place at the time of the press conference, when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump responds regularly to questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, before the journalists came to the scene of a free trip and sometimes a strange look.
The Minister for Health wrote to EU workers NHS in Scotland in connection with Brexit' fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and wishing to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter if the United Kingdom has left the EU for less than six months.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the costs of the status of EU citizens working in public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer negotiations on the resignation of the United Kingdom to the EU have continued to reach the expected decisions in this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-contract scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Companies from the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities to our service.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed after head trauma in emergency surgery
The Tennessee State Tigers supporter, Christion Abercrombie, passed an emergency surgery after the head injury and defeat 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury was just before the half-life.
"He fell on the side and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coachers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before they were placed on the kanderam for further examination.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center is complete.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/range of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State during his first season after the Illinois invading.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he had five battles that made a total of 18 battles during that season.
Foreign suppliers must pay higher Temple Tax when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign suppliers must pay higher Temple Tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this extra money to assist the homeless on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will disrupt Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
Temperature tax shall be levied on those who do not pay the tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign suppliers must pay a higher tempel tax rate when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this extra money to help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to disrupt Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and target high-income people.
The Temple Tax shall be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom by directing the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this Temple Tax, including higher levels established two years ago on another home and redemption purchases - may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the purchased London property belongs to non-United Kingdom residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for the first purchasers to get their feet down when purchasing housing.
Many prosperous regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become “commemorative cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices when they purchase land, but did not use it, and invited Mayd to waive the quotas for affordable homes to improve the UK 'depositary shame'.
Corbyn has announced the reform of a viewing housing economy, including hire control and cessation of stunning innocent people.
He also wishes to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “For the last year, I promised that, as Prime Minister, I would be committed to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Great Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build a life here.
It is, however, right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad are as easy to buy homes as those who work hard for the British people.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too distant and the strict sleep conditions are normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is the management of Scotland"
Jack Ross, head of Sunderlan, says that his “final purpose” is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who is currently in third position at the League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Masters League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and it was limited," said Ross BBC to Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up with my father, watching Scotland in Hampden, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
But this option will only come if I'm successful in managing the club."
The leaders of Ross were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear for such great and well-known names in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success is right now if I can take this club to the Championship."
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Championship," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I only see myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, being former Deputy Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts' leading staff.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the third level and by making St Mirren the lowest position for the next championship winner.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now when he was in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads," he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed a few moments of time.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
Kogen continues to do this with the pressure and pressure of his work, but the management just seems more right.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, and now I feel more comfortable than I've ever been in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for the surface is for Saturday at 17.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the flow of pubs in British trouble, but greater pressure on restaurant chains has arisen.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA representative of the business consulting company, compiled these figures: “The longer participation in world championships was expected by the sunny sunshine and England, which meant that July was similar to June when pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June, trade in downgraded restaurants worsened further in July.
Drinks-based pubs and bars were the most successful trade and the restaurants try to try the worst.
Food-based pubs suffered, despite the sun, although not so dramatically as well as restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
The sales of beverages were 6.6 per cent over the month, while food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure time and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and large social or sports events remains the greatest factor in sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summer could not have come in a worse time for food business operators, and only time would indicate whether the moderater temperatures we have experienced in August are giving some necessary relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trademark-related agencies.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and is a benchmark for the industrial sector.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The study carried out among the 20 000 Gymnasists found the growth of the "insta" leaves
The news raised fear that to be posted with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a basic account to show their parents.
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years of age, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study carried out among the 20 000 Gymnasists found a significant increase in the "insta" accounts (instagram of Insta).
The news raised the fear of being posted to sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account designed to show their parents and made acceptable to them.
One of his 13-year-old daughters discovered a secret page that a teenager called on others to rape.
Digital Awareness UK and the organization joining a private school Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognised the existence of personal accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing to see that so many teens are tempted to the animal’s accounts online, where parents and teachers do not find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes an athletic speaker at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to be the executive director of the Executive Board at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is the most approved lightweightist in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the events as a good opportunity for sport leaders to benefit from his wide international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidhi is respected throughout Scotland, the U.S. and other sports community, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will be able to benefit from calling his board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I would like to be an athlete speaker and I hope that I can contribute to Scotland’s sports in real terms and contribute to its development.”
The American who won the Olympic Games of Atlanta in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres a total of four Olympic Golds and now often shares his opinion in BBC, was unable to walk after a transnational ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said if I was to recover, and if to what extent, only time would be shown.
I've worked hard, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed lessons!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Advertisement of the chest pump that compares women to cows, distributes the Internet into two
The chest pump company has distributed the Internet with two camps of advertising compared to the breast-feeding mother’s milking cows.
According to the stories, the technology company Elvie published an ironic music video like that to mark the "first world-speaking breast pump" in order to present the freedom that this new pump gives itself to the mothers who wanted to live.
Four real mothers dance in a heinful table with cows and sing, "Yes, I'm living myself, but you don't see my tail" and "If you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The verse repeats: "Pumpa, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has produced reciprocal opinions on the Internet.
77,000 times viewed and thousands of comments video viewers have a different view. Many of them say that it lights the tent backs of the dairy industry.
“The use of leather to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and be born to produce milk, but the difference is that children are being stolen from them in days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not pour into the eye of the breast holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary said: “Surely traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to advertise the breast pumps of the mothers that can keep them?"
Someone added, "It's a completely careless ad."
A part of the ad, one woman thought it was fun.
“Leian, this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel completely cow.
Advertisement's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
The second commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for mothers who pump and feel like cows (your jobs or bathrooms).
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all danced in bras, not with spectacular pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on saying that many women pumping breast milk feel like a cow.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes, and there is no eye in the breast bra, giving women the freedom to move, to keep children and even to go out during pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
Compared to women's express opportunities and milk cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in a familiar and entertaining key an extraordinary relief of freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has reflected Elvie's pump.
On London’s fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the designer Marta Jakubowski.
Thousands of migrants' children went quietly on the Texas border to the campsite.
The number of children of arrested migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly crossings have remained quite the same.
Usually most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, which requires the child’s right to care.
The risk increased in June when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults of the household could submit fingerprints and data will be shared with the Immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the organization of immigration and customs, admitted to Congress last week that the Agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for minors not accompanying them.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested were missing a criminal past.
“Around 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ household members are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are in criminal circumstances.
So we keep tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with the children faster, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to be brought to court within a month of arrest, and formerly, the asylum workers said it was 60 days later.
Many defend their legal content to the Immigration Judge through a video conference, to come to the back.
The inappropriate ones are quickly sent out from the country.
According to asylum personnel, the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more current in large detention facilities, such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty can be missed because of the size of the child.
They added that moving children to the tent city without having enough time to get used to hours or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many are already in difficulty.
Syria demands that the US, French and Turkish occupational forces leave immediately
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the country is in war for eight years.
Moualemi, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that external forces were illegally prosecuted and dealt with accordingly on the Syrian surface.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem argued that Syria's “a terrorist war is almost over”. Since 2011 more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “go on fighting in this sacred war until we have cleansed the whole area of Syria”, both from the terrorist groups and from “any external force that is illegally present”.
The United States of America has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurds Units and the Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country of war.
Speaking about the military refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused of unreasonable fears that prevent refugees from coming to spread to some Western countries.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their neighbourhood,” he said.
"They are politically policing something that is merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted recovery aid until the war between Assad and the opposition has been concluded.
According to the United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which brings the last rebel base to the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the widespread take-up of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'explicit deadlines' and expressed the hope that military action would hit the fighters of the Jehades, including the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaedada, who would be "destructive".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura will soon hope to convince the Committees of new members of government and opposition to plan the constitution of Syria after war and to pave the way for election.
Moualem asked the Government of Syria to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why will Trump also be chosen for the second term of office
According to this logic, Trump could be won in the next elections in 2020 if the resignation and scandal had not been completed before, as is likely to be the Liberal Viewers.
Which would undoubtedly be the most exciting end of the “presidency office”.
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-time ratings have doubled by more than 1.05 million CNN and almost three times MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the top hour. Compared to four years ago, the number of 1,7 million viewers has risen. MSNBC receives the Rachel Maddow Show 3.5 million cable viewers have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
"This is the tension we are involved in, because we do not understand it," said the head of the ABC Drama "Designated Survivor" about the Secretary of Government, who becomes the President when the attack destroys the House.
Nell Scowel, who has experienced a comedy writer and the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club,” is the author of another theory.
He remembers the 2016 elections in Boston.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked
"He said he'd make me laugh," said Mrs. Scowel to me.
All this chaos has entertaining value.
Of course, as other TV shows, Washington's rumors can become fateful to Roe v Wade's future and reunion of immigrants to families and the global economy.
Aside from the subject is only the luxury of viewers.
However, a six-hour story shows about Bob Woodward's "substantial background study" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort's 13 225,73€ pay-in-town bomber jacket (Washington Post said about it as a "surpassive self-confidential clothing") and Stormy Daniels' aims in relation to the description of Mr Trumpi's anatomy or something, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mariod again with the same emotion.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a real life series, is that he shares something every night,” said Wheelhouse Entertainment’s executive director and the "Pandikunns" series by Brent Montgomery Trumpi’s intermediate actresses and day-to-day plans with the celebrations of NFL, Kim Jong-uni.
You can't miss any of this, or you're out of time.
At Fleiss' spot this week, his home was 80 degrees warm on the north shore, but he had been in the room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't give up to see how Brett Kavanaugh could handle the senate's legal committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on the hair.
“I remember how we did all the crazy shows at the time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,” said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

On the other hand, cash flows are moving to the most acute White House intermediate selection.
It is not surprising that the 17th region of Pennsylvania will receive cash flows due to the restructuring of the Congress area, bringing the two dominant companies to the same place.
As a result, the premier number of the Pittsburg district was again selected from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the second section of the place in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb's opposing candidate is Keith Rothfus, a Republican who is currently representing the previous 12th division of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section is overlooked by the new 17th.
The maps were amended after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January, and the old divisions were divided into the anti- Constitutional electoral regions in favour of Republicans.
The new 17th elections have rescued a campaign where the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Congress Committee of the Democrat campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican campaign (NCRCC) are dripping themselves with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a few wins much seen in March Pennsylvania's 18th Congress division in extraordinary elections.
This place has happened for several decades and President Donald Trump won in the area with 20 points.
Political public authorities have given a small advantage to the democrats.
The United States of America El Salvador was punished for China’s support and then retired
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, which was a small retreat to Washington.
Mr Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had Panama's hotel until the partners threw out Trumpi's management team.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from the American leaders of the diplomatic mission, because Heather Nauert, the Ministry of Press, said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, who received 140 million dollars of aid from America in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development and economic incentives.
The proposed penalties for reducing financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions would have been painful to the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the Internal Meetings, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level consultation with the aim of security and economic prosperity in order to arrange for a similar meeting last year, seen as progress in efforts to prevent the return of migrants to the United States.
But in the midst of September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue their consultation and to end the debate on any of El Salvador’s penalties.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being criticised, who speaks at the meeting in the mid- October to talk about the government's views.
And three American ambassadors returned to the secret El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh notices or punishment.
Mr Bolton, the White House Press Officer, refused to comment on the details discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the demand for anonymous stay.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government who also spoke on the demand for anonymity.
Study History
Next, the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on the possible justice of Trump, on which there are many evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly examining in his study whether the Trumpi campaign is related to Russia's attack on our elections.
If the Congress should change the party, Trump must report in this institution as he would again speak to the electoral and perhaps even his elderly judges.
There are many others here, and I do not want to point out that Trump or his European partners are inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make a choice that affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if only the West had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We drove and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual slaughters.
Historical history goes around the unloved march of such turning points and democracy, or it goes closer or delays.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the prosecutor's Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the boiling water since it was announced that he made a proposal for the secret recording of the President last year and speculated on the inappropriateness of that post.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
"How can you react if the recently requested FBI's investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of reliable accusations of sexual attacks and unfair statements?
And in particular, are we voting for the Congress in central elections if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy goes to a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from the Czechoslovakia who was captured by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who never took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me a sabbath of candles on a table with a hatch.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"

The Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the battle in Vienna.
Rangers will organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory of Australia, which followed earlier in the beginning of this month the impressive violin of Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become a Group of the European League G.
The knee injuries did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to use this result as a jump table for better results before 2 : 2 figs against Villarreal.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and we were again in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, because of this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave it behind the last season and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that those involved in the interview had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for them, few discussed it with their family members.
Approximately half of the Nationwide study participants said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he'd talked to his children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they do not speak on this subject,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance in Nationwide.
This should start, however.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family by discussing where and how to get maintenance, as these choices can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Talk to your financial adviser: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these costs.
Your funding opportunities for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financial life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or an asset self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already.
Make sure you have a health care mandate to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical attention and ensure that specialists follow your request at the time of your request if you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider the trustee also in relation to its financial contribution.
Select a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your bills will be paid even if you are incapacitable.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medicines and allergies?
Write these things up so you'll be ready if necessary.
“It is not just a financial point, but it is also important who would be doctors.” Martin explained.
“What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all in place."
Ilfracombe has been shot several times in a rifle.
The man was shot several times from the gun when he was on his way home after the night out.
In the '40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, in Devon's chest, abdomen and hands.
The policemen described the shooting at night at about 02.30 as an accidental act.

Earthquakes and tsunamids in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Palu of the city of Indonesia on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths continue to increase.
Since the communication has been broken, the saviors have not received any information from the Donggala Regent north of the Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
The request was evacuated after the disaster by more than 16,000 people.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
The request is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located on the west coast of the Sulawes island, and the population was estimated to have 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami unexpectedly hit it.
Donggala is a region that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) in the north-western part of the Sulawes island.
In 2017, it was estimated that 299 200 residents were in the Regent, which is an administrative area under the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawes, in particular the coastal area of Donggala.
It is also important to extract nickel, which is mainly concentrated on the coast of Morowal, Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Dismantling Agency, the tsunami have been hit by Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed the tsunami in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the light ring of the Pacific and is regularly encountered by earthquakes.
The following are the biggest earthquake and tsunami in the last few years:
2004: On 26 December, the great earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh Province of Indonesia, northern Sumatra, fired a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and at the beginning of April, several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the Sumatra coast on the island of Nias.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southern coast of the most populated Java Island in Indonesia, creating a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, near the capital of the Western Sumatra province, struck a 7-6-degree earthquake.
Over 1100 people were destroyed.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatra islands - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying tens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: The deep earthquake hit Aceh of the Regent of Pidie Jaya, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the death of the earthquake and the destruction of tsunami in 2004.
Tsunamit was not born at that time, but more than 100 people were killed in collapsed buildings.
2018: Greater earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in narrowness.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested in connection with domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the oldest son of Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to the report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, in the State of Alaska, in connection with domestic violence, in intervention and in arrest of opposition.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to inform the police about alleged crimes, Palin took his phone from him.
Palin is held in the Mat-Su pre-examinement facility and is being held against a 500-dollar unsecured bail, announced by KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was "not guilty", announced by the news network.
Palin is facing three A-class abuses, which means he can be expected to be imprisoned up to a year and a fine of $25,000.
He has also been accused of a class B crime that is punishable with one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking father Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, the police called her mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed in Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of intervention and possession of a weapon, all in a drunken state.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
The Veteran Groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when he linked his son to PTSD’s violent behaviour, resulting from his service in Iraq.
The Indonesian earthquake followed the tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed after the earthquake that hit the island of Sulawes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake fired the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the suburbs of Sulawes, which stayed in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos in social media show the moment of the earthquake.
During the time Tsunam was hit, hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the coast of the City of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors are requesting a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks.
New York Federal Prosecutors are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipo, suspected of a New York terrorist attack in which eight people died, and this rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack bicycle roads along West Side roads in Alam-Manhattan, so in October, both pedestrians and bicycles.
According to the request for a death penalty in the southern region of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and caused serious physical injuries in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, it is a possible death penalty on the basis of legal documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-point accusation against Saipov, including eight murder charges with extortion, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal offences, and charges for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "intensive planning and planning," said the prosecutors, describing Saipov's activities as "faithful, cruel and unfair."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” said.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last death procedure of the New York District District Court.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but the result was that he was sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
Last, the death penalty was executed in New York in 1953 in the Federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when a couple was executed after convicted conspiracy for the execution of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous snake, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he had told the investigators he was happy about what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to inspire the attack to carry out the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital palace.
In a 22-point accusation, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defenders, said that they were clearly disappointed in the procedural decision.
“In our opinion, the decision to apply for death penalty prolongs the injury of all persons involved, instead of life-long prison sentences, that is to be taken into account without the possibility of liberation,” said Patton.
Previously, the Saipov Defence Team asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
According to Mr Tory's Member, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to conduct the Brexit negotiations.
During the protest of today's Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to “mobify the Navy”.
Former UKIP leader said that politicians had to know the Eurosceptics "hot" because one of the Theresa May's own Members suggested that they be conducting negotiations with the EU.
The conservative sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub-Study Peter Bone said in Marsil Birmingham that the UK would be "ex-spired by now" if Mr Farage was a secretary
However, Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling its deeply divided lines, which were underlined by the conservatives in favour of stay, joining the city with their anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping its Chequers plan on the path between the Brexit supporters, the remnants and the EU attacks.
The Alliance demanded that it continue the transaction in spite of the counter-taking of Brussels and forced the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their own package and the chaos.
Bone said Leave Means at the meeting of Solihull that he wanted to give up the "Chequers plan".
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: "I stand out for Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
In reflecting its opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the vote in 2016: "The belief that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true."
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the marshal and told the reporters: “I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote in favour, it is unpopular among our political parties and our activists who actually walk along the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message to May, he added: “The Ministers of the House will be able to keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians at the meeting should be ‘cool’ when they plan to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now the question of trust between us – the people – and our political class" he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "We're not letting this happen."
The message to the enthusiastic audience added: “I want you to put our political class on the edge of Brexiti treason uncomfortable.
"We mobilise the national army of this country that gave us a victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud UK."
At the same time, the remnants marching through Birmingham before the two-hour gatherings held at the center of the city.
The coat full activists relied on the "Toors against Brexit" celebrations after the group was set up this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues that became part of the implementation of their political party during the opening of the conference.
“They are people who say that IT systems are in place and that all technology can lead to Canada and, moreover, for smooth cross-border, cross-border trade to Ireland,” he added.
“It's a complete fart.
The kind of thing that good Brex doesn't exist," he added.
Warren is seriously considering applying for president.
According to the U.S. Elizabeth Warren, he will consider serious candidates for president after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future on Saturday in the West Massachusetts district.

It specifies that he may be against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorates in the district after the appointment of Trump.
The attendant asked if he was planning to stand up for the president.
Warren replied that “wives have the time to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that also on the foreyard”.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Champion after the team counting gave him a victory over Sebastian Vetti
From that moment on, it became clear that Valter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team's sequence plays a major role in the race.
Bottas began well and almost lost sight of Hamilton when he first began defending his position and invited Vetti to attack his teammate.
The water went first to the bus stops and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after the Vetel, but Hamilton went to lead after his next position when Ferrari's leader left the inside to pass free after the third curve tried to protect it with double movement.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back of the square and was at the end of the first round on his 21-year-old birthday.
He then drove the competition for most of the time, driving the rubbers in the violins to the finish and passing through Kim's Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight circles, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman passing by me.
“The man has done a great job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump assaulted Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday's meeting because of an incident that he had not leaked the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the nominee of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual harassment.
When we met in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Legal Commission in the Senate, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people were “small, disgusting and lying”.
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that is currently happening in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and anger, evil, rude and lying people,” he said.
“ If you look at press releases and leaks, which are said: “Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document? ” — “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the senator's face.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein on charges against Kavanaugh and was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denyed that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations or leak his story," said Feinstein to the Committee.
"He asked me to keep confidential, and I did so, according to his request."
However, his denial was not suitable for the president who commented: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worse body language I've ever seen."
Continuing defending the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take the power back without selecting the resources.
They don't care who they hurt who they need to drive over to get power and control," said the President of the Media.

The flight manager dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
One Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure that hundreds of people transported airplanes would rise safely.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday caused a tsunami, followed by more than 800 deaths, many of whom have been unknown to disappear.
Strong retreats in the region, and many people are trapped under the ruins of Pal.
Despite the fact that the 21-year-old colleagues of Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled from Pau Mutiara Sis Al Jufri’s airport, he refused to leave.
He stayed at the workshop to ensure that the Batik Air flight no. 6321 is at the same time a safe take-off.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinks it'll collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia Press Officer Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of human lives, announced Australian ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport him from Balimantan to another city hospital.
Unfortunately, she died in the morning before the helicopter arrived at the return.
"We were extremely sad when we heard about it." added the pressman.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may increase to thousands. According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, access was restricted to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the press mediator of the Agency, said: “The number of deaths may grow because many victims are still under ruins and have not been escaped.”
The 6-meter waves devastated Palu's city, where there's a massive burial on Sunday.
Army and travel planes provide assistance and equipment.
The 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: “The Kiirabi will bring new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we cannot tell them what they can find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, arrived at the request on Sunday and said to the military: “I ask you to work nights and days to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?" announced CNN.
In the beginning of this year, Lomboki, Indonesian city, struck an earthquake where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia Air Accident: Air Niugin says one man has disappeared after the laguuni flight accident.
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crews were evacuated safely from a drowning plane, the airline now claims that the airline in Micronesia led a plane that fell into the Pacific Ocean that one man was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn't find one male passenger.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to passenger details such as its age and nationality issues.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane crashed on the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of an accident and the precise chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Marine said that the plane landed far from the Lagoon airport.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the airline.
The American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to shave on a drowning plane in a belt altitude into an emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew had a panic and screaming and that he had a little head trauma.
The U.S. Marines and sailors who worked on the cave near the United States also helped to rescue, using full-fledged boats to bring people to the shore, before the plane fell about 30 metres below the water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died during the last two decades in air accidents associated with PNG registered air carriers, but none of them were involved with Air Niugin.
The analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case on a re-examination of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Ministry of Justice, spent several hours investigating intelligence data as an expert observer.
He brought to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the 29-year-old complainant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims of a young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to the police to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the courtroom on Saturday and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Sanford had “the teller, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers before she died about two weeks.
The phone records showed that the women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that a while after Chambers died, he ordered Chambers messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
Defense is planning to make a court call on Sunday.
The judge said that he believed that the case would go to the later half of the same day to discuss the jury.
The High Breed: what is aware of the hiphop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristo claims that the hiphop is removed from the elements of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of the hiphop and make the conscious hiphop popular again.
The Fugees and Common have recently re-entered popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
New York's nanny's gonna sue a racist message for a couple of courts.
The New York babysitter appeals to the court of discriminatory dismissal after a few reports of accidental birth, where his mother complained that the babysitter was “a new black man ”.
A couple deny that they are racists, compared to the situation of extortion.
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed his anguish when he found out that their new childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work on the first day of 2016.
Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband a message saying: “EIIIIIIIII, MUSTAL.
But instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, a discomfortful Plasco-Flaxman was fired after his professional understanding of Miss Maurice, claiming that their company nanny, who was an afro-American, had done bad work and had been waiting for him instead of a Phillipin.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice appeals to a couple of courts to receive compensation for dismissal, which he wishes to receive every day in the amount of $350 in the next six months, and the same work he initially hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them to look, so do it," he said to the newspaper The Post, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
A couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that the termination of employment with Maurice was a reasonable act, because they were afraid that after insulting a girl they could not trust him anymore.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said the wife’s wife Joel Plasco newspaper The Post.
“How come you would allow your children to keep your children for a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was unwise?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison of the extortion, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “very complicated”.
“Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice now," added an investment banker.
Although the case continues, the public opinion has been condemned in a few social media, where they are highly criticised as a result of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that the readers would not communicate with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born immediately after the adoption of the book, said: “It is difficult to put himself in the shoes of a man who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, receiving an inspiration to write a children’s book of a small game bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic for rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was due to his father’s death.
For Paddington, whom he described as a “very important member of our family”, he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it was as if your child achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement.
I think he looked at Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
In landings, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"They called regularly to say that the daughter's condition was very bad and that they do not believe that she would survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I received a call from Nad, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I must say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep his heart moving were beginning to disappear quietly and leave the body.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems started to work.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what's happening.
I couldn't sneak, yell or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieves his daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about his experiences.
"No one knew it," he said.
“I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight, I felt a terrible outbreak of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him."
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide rabbits work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sticked cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get back.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and 18 years old when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile makes the whole room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that it has a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to contact and to speak to, even to their friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Ms. Humphrey, who's been a friend with Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, a partner of his 15 years together, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he'd feel bad or depressed or anything," he said.
“ We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest place during the first Christmas holiday – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It will rip the wound into the whole family.
It's gonna bite us.
But we have to keep going and continue fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a hair while the FBI starts investigating.
“I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted – a limited study of time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would ‘gone together’ in the midst of the congestion of partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to look into it?
Their reluctantness was due to the timing.
The interim elections will be only five weeks after November 6, and if the Republicans fail to go well, they will be prominently weakened in their intentions of becoming the man of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea Runners is "decreasing" under Kim’s government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoteing data from the Ministry of Coherence of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 troops (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korean citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Force Runners.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans from the end of the Korean war are illegally crossing the border in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to overcome than a highly protected demilitated area between Korea.
China takes force runners as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to the country with force.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they allowed to work in general in a nuclear-free direction towards the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of the lack of progress in sanctions.
"Unreliably the United States of America, our country lacks security and, in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos called Brett Kavanaugh as a "hysterical" and said that the man is inappropriate to judge the Supreme Court.
The opposition director of the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelos appointed the Supreme Court’s Commissioner Brett Kavanaugh as a “hysterical” and said that the man was temperamentally unfit to work as judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave an opinion on the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I felt inevitably that if a woman had appeared in such a way, he would have been called hysterical,” said Pelos about his reaction, which touched Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally the charges that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teens were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, describing his family and high school years, he occasionally almost screamed, and he was indifferent.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee by declaring the accusations against him for the loss of the presidential elections of Hillary Clinton, organised by angry Liberals as "grotesks and coordinated reputation killers".
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is not suitable for the Supreme Court's judge, because it showed that he was beaten against the Democrats.
“I think he discriminates himself with their statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
The fears remained modest when he was asked if he would try to refrain from his office if Kavanaugh was confirmed if the democrats had to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not just fit to judge the Supreme Court, but he’s not even fit to the court where he is currently working,” said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is now a judge of the Columbia District Court of Appeal.
He was also concerned as a democrat that he was concerned about decisions against Kavanaugh’s possible Affordable Care Act (Health Act – Translator’s remark) or Roe v Wade (Abort’s Act of Justice — a Prosecutor’s remark), as the man is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his session of confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It is now not a time when a hysterical calculated person could become a judge and expect us to say that it is not good,” said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair word, a monthly and year-old anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was a leader somewhere; he said that he also cried how angry he became, but he developed a method that stood out that when he got angry and started crying, he said to someone he was talking to, “You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are accepted partly as a rage outward because they are considered fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early workplaces in most men’s offices where I once found myself unspeakable in rage crying when one older woman — a rigorous leader I had always feared — grabbed me and dragged me to the staircase.
"Don't ever show them cry," he told me.
“They do not know that you are angry.
They think you're sad, and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, the then Congressman of the Democratic Party of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart skipped the unmarried ambition on board a hunter named Monkey Business and finished the campaign, the deeply irritated Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he shouldn't think about applying himself to the president.
“It was not a very well-designed decision,” she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"The only seven candidates were candidates, and the last thing they needed was to join someone else."
Someone said it was like "Snow White and seven thumb boys."
As the campaign had ended, he was late for collecting money, and he promised not to apply if he did not get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated 1,000 dollars to men, only gave him 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he meant.
When he made a speech where he announced that he did not launch a formal campaign, the feelings – thanks to the people who supported him, irritation against the system that made it difficult for the money collection and for the delegates to turn to the electorals, and anger against the sexism – were overcome by tears in his throat.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," reminded Schroeder of the press's reaction against him.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing to my tombstone.
"He cried?"
How the US-China Trade War can be useful to Beijing
The opening-up of the US-China trade wars were complaining, and although the battle is not far from over, experts say that the international gap could be useful to Beijing in the long term.
The President of the United States Donald Trump made the first warning bullet this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week on new tariffs, which relate to the value of USD 200 (GBP 150 million), by in escalating in escalating taxes on goods coming from China to the USA.
Beijing has responded with the same answer every time, with the last five to ten percent tariffs of $60 billion on American goods.
China has promised that the US should be shot to respond, and the second largest economy in the world is likely to not look at this moment.
Getting back to Washington would mean reconciling demands, but publicly worshiping before the United States would be too embarrassing to China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing's cards are correct, the trade war with the USA can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that lead to the loss of control of the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the by-products have previously acknowledged,” said a researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia's research at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready to return to the voluntary return of refugees and calls for it to rebuild the country after the war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country will improve.
"It is now more stable and safer in the territory of the country, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore the destroyed regions of the terrorists to bring back normality.
Now there are conditions that refugees who have left the country voluntarily to return to the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting everyday life and living.
According to the United Nations, 5,5 million Syrians have been escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, it underlined that the State did not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe took the win of Ryder's chariot in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Championships in 2018, defeating the team of the United States with 16,5 vs 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European surfaces and has not won Ryder's party in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team received 14,5 points to win the United States.
During the whole tournament, the U.S. star Phil Mickelson hit the wings on the par-3 track 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golf player Molinari shines in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved the result in the current format in 1979 : 0 : 0.
The American Jordan Spieth resulted in 5+4 the lowest present Danish Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, gave me 2 and 1 English Ian Poulter, to whom this Ryder Championship could last.
Eight of the Ryder Championship Veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of all time, with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It's a team spirit, and I'm glad I could help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He passes the torque to the colonial Jon Rahm, who won a single game on Sunday in the U.S. golf player Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I feel extraordinary pride that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking up,” said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now he writes a career in Ryder's chariot competition results 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who's won 14 major competitions, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was in a rush on finding all weekend fairways; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf during the whole tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States said after the team was disappointed: “I am proud of the guys, they were slight.
In the morning, there were some moments when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
The hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Championship Committee, and let's move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to get the hat up.
We were played better."
New information on water flow: concentrations decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Committee on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows a reduction in overall flower algae concentrations in the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of shorter prosperity in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which refer to decreasing concentrations.
The water flow range is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the north of Pinellas county to the south of Lee county.
The locations can be found 10 miles (16 km) away from the Hillsborough county coast, but there are fewer places compared to the previous week.
