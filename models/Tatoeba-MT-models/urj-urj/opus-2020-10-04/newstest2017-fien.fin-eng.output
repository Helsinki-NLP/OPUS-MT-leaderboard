The 28-year-old chef found dead at the shopping center in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairway of the local shopping centre this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "He finally did well."
The body that was found in the Westfield Mall Shopping Centre Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, was called the San Francisco Death Investigator's Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a homicide and that the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line-cock in Boston, had received his dream job as a line-up cooker at the Sanfranciscoan Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters representative said that they are "repulsive and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be very missed," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was at the beginning of the hostels, but recently, "these things were finally going well."
"He found the apartment and dated a girl," said Louis Galicia to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was goodwill, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling coherence with the family was to make us food, to make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was a brother who drove along the stream.
"In a world where so many things have been wrong, he was a grainless diamond that shined brighter every day," he said.
Everyone who has information about this will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's clue line number 415-575-4444.
Medical practitioners strike: Requirements for new work fighting measures
Representatives of doctors have asked their trade union to accept new workshops in their disputes with regard to the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the entire Council to support the new working measures since September.
The JDC says that ministers have not been able to take care of the agreement.
In July, doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
On Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "self-speak" on the issues which, according to him, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the Government of the JDC has voted to reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a special BMA Council meeting in order to obtain authorisation for a gradual and expanding work battle programme beginning in September.
The dispute has followed that doctors have been involved in six strikes this year, including the first complete workshop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The BMA’s director, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected, the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and that it should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be ordered to the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: External Association?
The one that ended up in the crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met with hands and declared that the fight against words and economic sanctions lasted for eight months was officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I was clearly impressed that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, the occasion was handed.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he did not much threaten the heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times, according to a report.
I lost my mind in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my own opinion, his enthusiasm pictured the opposite.
But the vileys radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was mad.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow on his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkishs were responsible for everything.
The most serious accusations of high officials were that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade from the Syrian regions dominated by Isis.
He's been denying this hard.
But in Peter, the official message was that it is time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of reconciling a tight truce are clear.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failure of last month.
Continuous terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially for order flights that usually carry several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local travel organisers and subscriber airlines are certainly relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season to rush into the Mediterranean Sea.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since the import of agricultural products from Turkey is once again allowed.
"Script in there, tomatoes back here", as was formulated in the Vedemost-sanomale report.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
The western countries are angry about what is considered a weak answer to the attempted coup.
When it is added to the long-lasting grudge from the pre-existing EU negotiations, Putin is enthusiastic to exploit cooling and crushing Turkish ties to the western countries.
The Russian leader must have gotten out of Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survivor for Moscow, who has a deep root in his fear of change of power.
So this meeting in the pramean seafarer allowed the "external association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation for me: two countries who experience the Western countries who rejected them and mistreated them, combining their powers.
However, these two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself with the role of the peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be much to say that, after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The Turkish President was aware of the avoidance of answering the question with regard to their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the full potential of disasters when a member of NATO is shot down by a Russian fighter, it is certainly better that two leaders are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from non-Scotland customers
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will be deployed to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the international objectives of the bank.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
At this time, the Bank's strategics have used the RBS product label to protect other consumer financial structures.
It was supported by millions of pups used to sponsor international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon Master Andy Murrayh.
But it is now considered right to allow more national brands to come to the front.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references to the main office and the stock exchange lists will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland's customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a round of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become the employer of our investors and employees, because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank became a global brand, the RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship and has raised the profile of different brands in their sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards the brand bank, because essentially (we have asked) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done, focusing on the needs of customers, not ours, I believe that you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettor wins in New Market with Predilection and wins 3000 wins
The dettor will shower the champagne after the double win has a total of 3000 wins.
Kilparatist Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3000th British win in New Market on Friday.
He arrived at the stall tonight with his second victory on his home track in his competition with the Predilection that was trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this virstan column in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The Triple Champion Jockey Dettor, who won earlier with Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and a 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The dettor sucks his own cheerleaders when he's pulling Predilection up after the victory.
Two racers have achieved this virstant bargaining competition, Masterjockey Richard Johnson, and a retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins in his career that broke records.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 winners
Frankie is one of the best race racers in the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this sausage, which has only been achieved by a few people before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical stench separates him from others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasms and charisms have been pulling fans into the species for years.
I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would've riding 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and a big race jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie's been riding the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person that's good for British competition, but he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the stack of a stack of a branded drone landing from the saddle.
Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British race for two decades.
It's been a mountain track.
Accidental profits in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the aeroplane accident and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned after a six-month ban, he had a hard time returning, but he showed significant strength when he challenged the suspects and returned to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time... the Dettor has said before that he would like to continue to compete until he's at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin separates Sergei Ivanov from the Headquarters of Staff
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trust in the inside for many years.
63 years of age has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
In the Kremlin statement, Putin has said "determined Ivanov to depart from the role of the Head of the Russian Presidential Government", but no reason was given to it.
Assistant Director of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Persecution, 44. He's a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that persecution be replaced.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, operated the Soviet Security Service in KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the state TV, both men claimed that the Head of State had withdrawn from his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few people here are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just the aftermath of some kind of power fight?
No one knows yet.
However, the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential candidate for President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been truly suspiciously accepted.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremli website, Ivanov said, "It is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, I wish you could even say to work, the task.
Well, now I've been head of office for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to act as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service at KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at the FSB, who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanovi as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanovi could become President of Russia after the second period of Put, because the third period of Puti would have been against the Constitution.
This mission, however, went to another close alliance named Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became the Prime Minister before he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the Criminal Minds, got fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a serial scene in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios, and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, acting as Gibson, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes on the scene.
I regret it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents is expected later.
The 54-year-old who stared at Dharma & Greg has been involved since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be involved until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and above all the best fans that the series may have.
The beginning of the twelve-series production period has been planned for the 28th September.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish that have left behind.
Bain, living 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing University location: The bridge now extends to Fife
1,35 billion pound project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry's crossing site, along with the bridge, which means that the bridge is now extending to Fife.
It's the first of the four seals between the "nationals" who are now graduating around every three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 strips.
The 1,35 billion pound project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment for building Queensferry's extremist location.
We all demonstrate the very impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the finishing of the feathering between the bridge and the bridge is a necessary operation in which the extremely accurate dimensions need to be agreed.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge decks are now in place and the last part of the deck's concrete is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be placed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Chief of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first shutdown in any bridge project is always an important milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shuttle represents the top of building technology.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and combined with an expanding North Pole, then we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the inner country, from the side.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the north side of the bridge.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
It is huge, since the ground is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and was to be pulled at approximately 3% caliber angles.
It is demanding that the permitted deviations that the team worked were small, only a few millimeters in both directions.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue to Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy when they're alive"
Three men are "happy when they're alive" after they fell on their fishing boat in the vicinity of Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue station alerted on Friday at 13.20 (BST) after the crew saw the event evolving at the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat went on.
"We saw a boat circling closer to men and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the man of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them until we got on the move," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of the boy without the rescue wings.
The men were taken into the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely injured.
There was a tapping line in the boat's engine, but it had somehow removed a boat from the previous person when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is respectable for the hunting of health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been worried about the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their time on displays.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some kind of activity.
The display time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now recently on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and external activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the wildlife called Pokémon Go. The application, based on the characters that were originally developed in the 1990s (afterwards, they were created in the drawing series, gambling cards and other consecutive products).
As many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the publication of the game in other countries was delayed, as a huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in days did Pokémon Golla have more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
Then how does it work?
In the nut shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be "lighted" after finding (with the phone screening) or "purchase".
The generation who played the game when he was younger has joined the wildlife and jumped up from the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the average person.
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, followed by 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days the number of people moving from the publication of the game was jumping from 45% to 53% in cardiogram users.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
A number of public health campaigns have called "to find 30", "to get up from the couch" and "to be active every day" not to produce any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and caring people who seem to be miserable.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
A lower risk of cancer or depression is present in regular mobility.
Activity helps weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
Pokémon Gon's fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, raitis of air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends hunting.
As usual, glorious cheerleaders are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications such as Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give the same reason to move as this game.
The news has disappeared and the use is down in time.
However, because of the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and the activity of virtual reality in the real world, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and healthy.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a multiplayer of women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energy jumps.
Smooth with the booze.
It's incredible with perman.
Excellent everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American assault reached a multi-game championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between itself and the rest of the world to the Olympics’ lights.
His overall point, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver artist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian proncial medalist Aliya Blackfina.
In the US Simone Biles Balancers, the final final of women's multiplayer fighters in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman who has consecutively won the championship of the multiplayer, and all in all, the fifth American master, and he also strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He broke into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his same class with other generations of best athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
The party has ruled its species for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programmes whose ambition and accuracy mix has been so astonishing that the 1984 Olympic Master Mary Lou Retton called him "the best winner I have seen".
The last test was awaited in Brazil, the competition not so much between Biles and other competitors, but the burden of his and his high expectations.
Returning home to the family in Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
On the left of the United States, Simone Biles, and Aly Raisman will hug after winning the multi-winning multi-winning of women in this order in the end of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, elok.
The party reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he was a top-up national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi, at the departure party.
Although Biles argued that he has never thought about the future in the long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Some of his permanto program, which includes his brand's voltage, has been reconciled to Latin American music, which would also fit well on the street next to the Olympics of Rio.
This isn't a coincidence.
The girl his grandparents adopted on the backyard, whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on the study hall, where Boorman trained, has become a force factor.
He has not lost in a multi-game since summer 2013, and this winning tube will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was a small leader after two rounds, it was just a illusion.
Balance boom and permanto, where Biles is a dominant world champion, awaited.
He rose to the top at boom points 15.433, and crossed them by obtaining 15.933 permano.
Raisman used to hug him good-bye when they were waiting for the endpoints, just formality, and tears rose into Biles' glitter red, white and blue-limited eyes, when the dream of which he once wrote his clipbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of revampance from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost a bronze to Blackfina in renovation.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, the Americans called "Grandmother", was clearly in charge.
After his permantation, he sent the audience a flight of kisses in a sense of return, which sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for the party, this 19-year-old widespread tweet from the previous week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car
In the last decade, the first serial killer in Phoenix, the deadliest attack, two women who died and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car and listened to the music when they were shot, so they were reported in the news of the police on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12.
The news reports that the shooter standing on the side of the passenger of the car triggered a gun up to eight times and then escaped with another means of transport.
According to the police, the triple death did not seem to have been the result of the robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or another adult victim $2900.
Phoenix policeman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that shooting led researchers to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
Seven people have all died and two injured in the nine attacks in four months, which have been committed in two main parts of the Latin American city.
"This is what happens in a residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of means of transport, such as Nissan brown at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence which led to the conclusion that attacks are related to each other and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was injured into a hospital where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene of the event.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parking car to listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the triple death, which was targeted by an empty open van, believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet seals, bullet seats, and bullet fragments in the engine mode.
A 6-year-old mother with microkephalia: "Your condition will be relieved."
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his age mates, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when he was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I did," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walk.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like when he was only three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he achieves slowly some sausages.
He walks with help and drives a bike.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show you how the references that Edmund's invented show "I want you to sing to me."
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this isn't a normal sign language, he says that Edmund's invented some of his own strings.
Microchephal may be due to a number of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund’s case, or congestive viral infections such as butterfly or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the life of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by the future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prediction in a while, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to give me one.
But Picciut has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's gonna make things easier.
You can believe it's gonna make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The massive and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana.
In Louisiana’s massive floods and widespread floods led the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their skates and caused a large flood due to extremely heavy rains.
Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities and that aid is already coming to the necessary districts.
Mike Steele's representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Emergency Office said that they're receiving requests for lifting water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard will be in force until Saturday, most of the south of Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that more rain is expected in the region from three to five cents.
In the southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the mobile area.
The Comite River that flows near Baton Rouge and the Amite River that flows near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set the flood peak during the weekend.
The weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood in several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the lower flooding of the Ascension county along the river when the rivers were flooding slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the Mississippi State border in Lousiana Liverpool was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Saviors are still picking people from the flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest Mississip.
On Friday, Leroy Hansford and his wife and granddaughter were among the rescuers of Gloster.
62 - year - old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek from his house rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the second, close-looking nephew warned him.
"We glowed, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It reached my belt.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the water of the stream so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both his family and his family are injured and that he's the only swim-skilled person.
Hansford said that the rescuers saved the three in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods are "fastly wide" when the heavyways continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness close to Livingston reports 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely exhausted since Wednesday.
The flooding of heavy ports and streets led to the rescue of Tangipahoa county residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school circuits, reported by the authorities.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reports that in Tangipahoa, a member of the city council said 200 homes were flooded.
The people were evacuated in two churches, but both of them are now under the flood.
The president of the district, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets that had remained the islands of the rising water.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They can return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa, 20 streets were closed because of the lifting water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sand tacks to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last large flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city administration.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Officer Rupert Lacy said that a smooth rain continued on the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, handsome houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amite has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, full of bullets, will survive the Philadelphia shooting.
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in town this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown received several shooting wounds, such as femurs, foot, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgery has been performed for him.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first class at the local subschool.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car, together with a 29-year-old in critical state, reporting.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross between several shooters.
Assault types of shells, which originated from different attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
On the street, there were shells on both sides of the walk.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle," told the station the Philadelphia police chief, Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and means of transport in the area were also hit.
There are no arrests, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance camera records.
Another six-year-old, girl, got a misleading hit on her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is how I call the Olympic Olympic Women for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three winners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will be proud of all.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of dark and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female forcer has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America hurried.
Now the world has been able to prove the unbelievable performances of a three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglasi and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masteric power programs.
On Thursday, Simone became a fourth American woman who has successively won an individual gold in women’s multipliture.
And the teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in the stunning platforms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because the following Olympics will have only four winners, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics are a precious type, and the gymnastics practice in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, spaces, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel payments (coachs and their gymnastics and their families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburban areas that can support the species.
These clubs receive all their training, and this is a precious and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started their gymnasm.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training into communities where many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lauri are living.
I founded my foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable victories in Harlem for more than 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high level of strength for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic species.
Strengthens develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, and mental harshness, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to start powering, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're having an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and that you motivated so many young girls coming from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctoral interns to organize new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal.
Ministers had hoped that they would stop the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the doctors who took part in the 37 000 votes rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed the plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small delays would harm the staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement, which will include changes to the night and weekend careers in order to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Medical Training at BMA, said last night in the opinion: "Health practitioners still have serious concerns in relation to the proposed agreement, in particular to stimulate the existing labour crisis, and that they do not treat all doctors fairly."
In time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, only eight weeks are left, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through the negotiations have faced the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite this, Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctoral traineeshipers.
If he doesn't do that, doctors are ready to continue working.
At the end of April, the last strike meant almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 postponements of reception, when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as a substitute for slot doctors.
Ministers had hoped to stop the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 medical practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the Executive Director of the NHS Employers Organisation, appealed to doctoral trainees so that they would not break.
Mortimer said, "Workings achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause care, anxiety and disturbances for patients, caregivers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of monitoring (Guardian Role) and the phenomenons (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hoping to continue a positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from sabbath-free return, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, learning freedom and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of cardiac attack patients are benefiting from two pounds per day after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans longer.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people get a heart attack in England each year, and a quarter of them get another seizure or stroke.
The heart attacks and strokes are due to the accumulated fat material in the artery wall, which forms stenometers.
If a stroke breaks, it can cause blood clotting that prevents blood circulation in the heart by causing a heart attack.
If the coagulation breaks down, it can pass with the blood and cut the bloodstream into the brain, causing stroke.
In people who have already received one seizure, there is an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the Isobritannian company AstraZeneca, sold by the name Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
It is recommended that 90 mg of ticagrelor be given to people for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective preventive treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, which is often destructive."
Fear of recurrence may have a significant negative effect on the quality of a person’s life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In order to initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add the available treatment options to thousands of people potentially benefiting from them.
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over three years, the draft guidance is not recommended for further treatment than for this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the prosperity of the electoral heritage in the Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was withdrawn last year because of corruption, impulsing the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the lack of attention to a wide-ranging voting fraud in Muslim communities, which is expressed today in a shocking government report.
The former Minister of Government, Sir Eric Pickles, advocates the police, electoral overseers and city councils that they have ignored the evidence of the electoral gravity because of the "rotuation and religion-related susceptibility".
The former Community secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that it should be possible for the police to set guard chains for the protection of voters feared outside the voting places.
He recommends that voters present their identity cards when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even suggests that the person who votes should put undefeated ink on his finger so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says he should be better protected.
He calls on the press to access more extensively the Council's documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect the electoral wilderness, but would protect the local government more widely from the culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the electoral pot," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the vote scandal of the Tower Hamlets of East London.
Last year, the Special Elections Court decided that the seating mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of several charges of corruption and illegal action.
The Court of Justice stated that Rahman had "successfully distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, and has silenced his critics in accusations of racism and fear of Islamic fear.
It is said that Rahman has led his electoral campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Even 300 votes were suspicious or resulting from a person being voted in another act.
Sir Eric said there was evidence on the ground in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern in the postal vote of the electoral poll, where the members of the Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the proof of identity on the ID certificate.
He says in his report: "Proofs were presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote, in particular in the communities with a Pakistani or Bangladesh background, according to the wishes of the elders.
"The concern was that... the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of the 'politically correct' susceptibility of race and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals to clean up the system, which included the ban on political activists to deal with the posted voting tickets so as to "collect votes" end.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for more stringent amendments to registerers to prevent the use of the election register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Examine the options for witnessing the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of a person who votes for an undefeated ink so that no one can vote twice.
Work systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal vote.
In order to prevent political activists from dealing with the voices and envelopes that have come through the post, where the votes are sent.
Let the police put the guard chains around the voting positions.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make the photography illegal at the voting places.
It requires that only English (except in Wales) be used at the voting points.
Strengthen training in order to ensure that the staff holds the provision that the electoral should go to the cabin alone.
Sir Eric's telling the Grand London police, saying that it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were raised after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court will remain as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticizes the ineffective "basic screen checks" at the City Council's voting offices.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as a born parliamentary, but this worrying and mysterious spread of the electoral shell and the denial of certain groups of facts threatens this good reputation."
As a madman to Kate's bike twins and other pictures of the celebrity at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rion 2016 Olympics have gone confused with a French bikeman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, proven to be a dual creature of the Princess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Advocate is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer who can compliment with his own famous double being, at least according to social media.
So in honor of Rio's races and of all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic sportsmen who clearly appear to be Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, member of the US Men's Fleet Shooting Team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double creature on the bike track, many people on the Internet have been quick to point out how a certain sniper could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, member of the US Men's Fleet Team, has caused a storm on Twitter since he got on the surface of his images where he seems to be terrifying as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the agitation of the social media, the sniper admitted that he has heard that he appeared to be Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a lot of similarity, except maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also be highlighted this year: an astonishing similarity between the British long-term jumpers Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
Alya Mustafina's greatest Russian assault, with the most obvious eyes, has been said to be a Cuban American singer of Gloria Estefan's double being.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
Larger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actress's "athletic version"
Another long-term comparison has been between the tennis player Rafael Nadal and the actress Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russia's silver-mill swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than the same actress with Annalynne McCord than the brown skin and blonde hair, while the U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds the fans of the "Joseph Gordon Levitti sports version".
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities
Theoretical presentation: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website because "the rest of the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. Football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actress Laura Linney, and the winning winner of the gold medal Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matchs the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union smile.
The CBC Olympic Commander apologizes after the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the four-year-old Ai Yanhan, instead of the four-year-old woman's 4x200 metre free swim message, aroused CBC's direct Olympic broadcasters on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC had to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female "lost like bad smell" and "dead as a pig."
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions with women 4x200 metres of free swim in the communication final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC reporters to bring "cold", said: "This little 14-year-old China broke up, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost as a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 swims at the second part of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly online after shocking the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer "dead like a pig"?
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on a live broadcast."
The Chinese Ai Yanhani was described in the 4 x 200 metre communication final of the women's free swim as follows: "This little 14-year-old chinese broke out, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was a hero and a quick one, with many who challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves in hearing how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Soon after this, Scott Russell, who drove into the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on the delivery was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to the people who tweeted as an answer to the comment.
The reporter, Scott Russel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, the CBC copied and joined an apology request for more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also promptly apologized and published the opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and our followers to apologise in social media in direct broadcasting.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that the comments made by Byron were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for direct broadcasting and tried to define his comments by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in this moment for the comment that I made last night after a woman's message," she said at the CBC's Olympics.
"I put a swimmer in performance, not a person."
"It's too unnecessary to say that I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client is shocked by a woman who arrogantly reconstituted underwear in the middle of trade.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark's movement to try her underwear.
The fact that after assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman took them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to circumvent and finally reconciled four pairs of underwear at the store, located at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman made up her underpants and then put them back in the shell.
At the same time, the two kids' moms at the store Jenny Davidson said that after trying to get underwear, a mysterious woman "weared again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "Mans didn't believe in their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took the pair of underwear, ripped off her own stockings and underwear and put her legs on.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there as shameless."
"Everybody stared while he took off his underpants and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same thing for three couples before he finally decided that he didn't like what he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about a person who would end up buying his underwear that he made up for."
The 33-year-old Davidson in the town of Kent said, "It's disgusting to think that someone takes his home underwear that someone else has tried but which has not been cleaned."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I said that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing after she left, which is good."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find out that another woman has put them on and took them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from the sale."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Grand Champion Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to handle the robbers who were swinging the gun in the nearest distance.
Then they approached you from or behind, this video shows how you can pay the attacker with the same size.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from the back, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your assault and you're going to get a line of fire.
Then you will catch the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before hitting the attacker on the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting on your knees, and when the attacker goes out of pain, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun and hold the gun on him.
If the armed person approaches from the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to launch.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his hand, back off and point him out with a gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way away from the robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright is licking the dirtyest places in Europe for the travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomiting reflex by licking some of the dirtyest and nightmare places in Europe.
Suffolk's director and traveller Ian Wright, 51, licked euro banknotes, cables in Piccadilly Circus, train toilet washing sticker and Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before arrowing each target, he used a photometric to show himself and to us the situation he was going to.
However, an experiment made by a film called the Inner Force, produced surprising results.
The idea of arrowing a train with thousands of people can seem totally disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen.
Throughout Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester for the endurance of his bowel when he traveled around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task of the public railway stations to the toilet seat was indeed testing his immune system.
In the film he said, "After the child, I've been rather concerned about my health, and I've put in my mouth all sorts of things from the soil, worms and the fat water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had over 4,000 units in the photometric.
Due to comparison, the read of the retarded hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public gym, he refused to arrow when the photometric result showed more than 4,000 units, and the retarded hands resulted less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, after internal power, together with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's a nightmare here.
After the internal power, the Finnish dairyman, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Valio snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and, at the same time, explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up in the thought of "whether Ian should be called."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a world-wide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Increasing interest in the health of the intestines is a global phenomenon, and this documentary paper enables us to tell more consumers in an interesting way.
I also think that the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say it now, even if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, such as the night-to-night Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of these things were easier for Ian, while some of them were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In the Valio 2015 survey, 84% of respondents directly combine the lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and the intestine, and 58% said that they at least use products that have been added to dairy acid bacteria.
The evacuator family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash before the evict.
The enormous family caused the damage of GBP 50,000 to his rental house after being expelled because of the terrorism of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash after a number of complaints.
When they were removed from the property by means of force, the employees of the disgusted housing company found the property in poor condition.
The walls had been made with slamming holes, the floor boards had been torn, the waste was spread on the floor and the walls were wasted with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in a private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the master of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the people, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here because this property is likely to be known through less-favoured groups of Cornwall.
This family is bad, and their name is bad."
The Parish had three boys who lived in the property, and the police said that the family’s fearful power had been involved in the street fights on baseball fields, the scare of close residents, drug use, drug sales, and the luxurious screaming, arguing and curse.
In June, 47 years of age, Skeldon, whose name was the lease contract, made a decision on unsosial behaviour.
There were old wastes in the rooms of the house under the crash.
The property, from which drugs have previously been transferred, had the floor boards been stretched.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing expelled power from the property of a woman and this partner this week after giving them a extended period of 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The eased neighbors thanked the expulsion, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen a police officer incredibly many times here.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
It's lovely now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Managing Director of Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Waste and old toys have been thrown down on a wild wall in the rental house.
He added: "It's a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, because the expulsion is always the last procedure Cornwall Housing considered.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave, informing community members.
I hope that this development will bring something comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in real estate in different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The employees of the dwelling company need to clean up the house surrounded by garbage mushrooms.
In 2014, the police made a ride in the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as weight, supplies and 1,700 GBP in cash.
Skeldon received fines when he granted his guilt for the possession of class B drug as a intention to disseminate it.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Obviously, Tanya and her partners are living homeless now being frozen in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
A lot of graffiti was wasted on the walls of the house's rooms.
The police say they're trying to expel the people who think they're mocking the rules of their lease agreement.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police said that expelling was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to keep the rules pranked.
"This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without sanctions, and for those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military skiing machine flew on the beach down
In Portugal's Aveiro, the sun worshipers experienced a shock in their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane was wiped out very low.
Air Forces said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, the horrified tourists began to panic when a low-flighted jet wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military plane came to almost contact with the sandbands in the North Portugali Aveiro.
The vacationers rose up when they understoodly began to worry about the noise from the shower, even though they had not seen what was coming from the clouds behind them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos about a dramatic passing through social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice at a very low level, and one point seemed to be falling into the ground."
Nunno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like a machine was falling on me."
The tourists at the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew in an incredibly low plane
The Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion machine was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the drill had flew far lower than usual due to the low visibility of smoke in nearby landscapes, but the air forces assured that no one was in danger of safety.
The landfills have destroyed parts of the continental Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air forces said today that the pilot had to fly with low visibility due to conditions of detriment, smoke caused by landscapes and thick clouds,
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
The first half of exote is better than expected
The South Karelia social and health district (Eksote) made a better outcome in January - EUR 3.4 million in June.
The exote’s result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Exote is trying this year to shorten the lines of action.
The excess covers the previously resulting deficit.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and buy measures for patients.
The result of the year as a whole is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the six-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special boundaries sworn in Immola
Seventy-seven armies at the Border and Maritime Guard have sworn a military oath on Friday.
Military elections were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Range Course was held in the Army Sports Field.
A soldier's oath swore about 70 armies.
Special border guards are trained for required border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, he applied for 310 young people as a special boundary.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special borders have been trained in Immola since 2007.
There were five veterans involved during the war with the trains of the border forces during the event.
The middle age of those with them is now 90 years.
The elders were born in 1918.
A lot of thieves ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police departments in Finland have been a RTA, the Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwards invisible.
In Hämeen Police Department, the unit comprises four policemen in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant in the Bay.
Inspector General, he's Inspector Lahde.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civil suit.
The unit has shown its fitness and need, looks at Deputy Chief of Police, Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will produce different reports to the other police.
In the ambush, it has acquired information on asylum seekers, among other things.
Reform of the most recent working practices
Establishing analytical units is the latest reform of police practice.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would go on more and more often, only when they get an alarm.
With the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
In addition to the reform of the police administration, a country was established by a Criminal Intelligence Centre, less than three national units, and to each police department its own Criminal Intelligence Unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Criminal Police runs national activities.
In PTR units, people from Police, Customs and Border Guard work as their name.
The RTA departments, in turn, work in areas shared by police departments and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national departments.
Inquiry extends beyond its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, as crime does.
Those working at the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, alerts databases and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the factor is formed by a certain image.
Frequency may be carried out either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The staff of the RTA unit do not walk the necks up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Both the methods used by criminals and their own methods are not reported because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus to prevent police offences.
The method is publicly reported by the police if it expects them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was news from the early summer, the way in which the apartments used to be vacant in the housebreaks were labelled.
In that way, the authors put a stick, a needle or a piece of tape on the outside door of the apartment, which they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
Pre-examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analytical unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning about their mistakes.
The smartest are ordering a record of the law, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, the thieves are left with gloves in hand.
For the purpose of the case, an interview has been received from Tero Seppasta Hämeen Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepolaa from the Itä-Suomen Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from Central Criminal Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to design practical activities.
In the context of a reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside of its own institution and Finland’s borders.
A school girl with fathers killed in Syria from London
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Daddy, has been reportedly dead in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, the ITV News reported that a girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to his family, he died just when he planned to escape war from the land that was torn and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and testament to others that there are real risks to leave the war zone - that it could lead people to give up such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London school girls flew to Turkey, from which they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family of Sultana was told that she had married the Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
The Senate's Democrat Director, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the candidate Hillary Clinton of the Democrats will be appointed to the Supreme Court of Judge Merrick Garland if he is elected as President.
The Republicans of the Senate have prevented Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Mitch McConnell, director of the majority of the Senate, says that the next president will choose to replace Antoni Scalia's Supreme Court member.
Reid said on Thursday at the phone conference that he predicted "with certainty" that Clinton chose Garland.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "build the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Appeal of the United States in the District of Columbia District.
Reid said that the Republicans preventing Garland's name are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handgirls" and "openers".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is "women like men"
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next top generation of the 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, President of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with naked pictures differs from Playboy in the old school because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them.
"We must begin to introduce timeless and classic nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these naked women's images," said Shaw in the press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
The models can leave pictures via the network or personally open to the selection of Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: Who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill out the commentary with irritated offences, whose author is a name NoAllUniversalsKeski-Age Menhet, you will note that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of many talks was not because more and more of those born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the excitement of physical objects, but the horror of the middle age.
Apparently, those who bought a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, most unlikely records are purchased in the 18-24 age group.
It is also not just about collecting enthusiasms, but it contains emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are likely to have feelings within them (56% vs 53%) and enjoy alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, and I'd be very quick before I stop, I'd make a cup out of my hands, and I'd say something worthwhile, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's look into it more closely.
At the same time, when Soho's attractiveness and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants, shops, and office supplies are now filled with buildings with previously independent movements - a handful of brilliant specialized disc stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to various men in some of these cities while trying to evaluate their age and emotions.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends his afternoon due to the meeting in London, and circulates shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records that appear in the picture above (for sending a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home) cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of records and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were released, and he can buy again the ones he sold when he was young and unfunded.
"A large part of the material I bought is late in the 60s and early in the 70s, the records that were published when there were 11 or 12 records that I was probably a little too young to get," she says.
He agrees that disc buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my worst."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he encountered fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have had the need to buy their old records back.
On the basis of the discussions that I have held, people have been separated from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who sold their vinyls to buy cds now sell their cd to buy their discs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl regenerations of certain ages.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realise that disc shops provide comfort to similar types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured in particular from the near-paying system.
Some vinyl fans can be disgusted from the digital world and choose to trust the persistence of familiar records; objects that raise the memories of the lucky days of teenagers.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's a simple way of filling in the thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" The other employee suddenly said from the recording pile.
The April ICM’s question of opinion revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, whereas 7% of buying vinyls do not have a record player.
In this section, the news report is likely to seem very worrying when I spin the pino of the bossa nova collections.
This resurrection's "prize" perspective is something which also has been noticed by Jonny, 42, working in the Sound of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead disc so that we can put it on the shelf", she says.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late-aged people who are just getting excited about it.
In the Foppi, which today has almost a full layer reserved for vinyls, I have a much more diversified audience.
Seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous movements, it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem so lonely, but it's hard to show that it's hard to have a shiny psychological trauma standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching the various albums on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so the record collection is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on the computer or on something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he's in love.
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
It is said that my last stop was raised by a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jean horses, I'm finding a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter thought about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left, there is a staircase with walls covered by Adele's, Jeff Buckley's, Amy Winehouse's and Fleetwood Mac's records: a mix of modern music and classical music, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyls".
However, given that even the small attention received by these objects can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho to get more, there is not much to complain.
It is not surprising that the population with more and more time and money is also the one who uses the most luxurious things, such as vinyls.
But even though my discovery suggests that YouGov's results are valid at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in disk stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning male around Berwick Street's record stores, backing records, and avoiding the creepy, 30-year-old, artificial TV drinker's eyes on this throat over the shoulders of unfamiliar middle-aged men.
The Holker is the most inhabiting animal - video report
Researchers say that the holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spine.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and five metres long.
The French court rejects the application to dismantle trades from the Jungle Refugee Camp
The French court has rejected the application by the Calais authorities to dismantle tens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court handling this week, Calais’s authorities argued that the State should be able to dismantle all of 72 temporary trades where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea with 50 cents (40 pens) or sell simple food in a few euros of temporary food.
The Calais Principal Office justified that the sites should be dismantled because they represent the non-paid co-financing of taxes and because they are a risk of fire and cleaning.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital to say that the free meals offered by the State-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court of Justice ordered that there were no legal grounds for expelling 72 temporary traders, but said that Calais's concern for the prefect was fully understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role than just feeding people who live in extremely uncertain conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites under the crash was Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are unprofitable and offer 200 meals a day, English and French hours, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's café.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the café would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, have assessed on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - to top reading - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food in Finland falls clearly faster than in the EU average
Food is cheaper in Finland for consumers and for producers to be harmed.
In Finland, food prices have decreased by almost 5 per cent in three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen to second most in Finland in EU countries with a level of wages similar to Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is reflected in the article published in the Information & Trendit blog, Head of Statistics Finland's Development Ilkka Lehtisen.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which have been proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are this year's June.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices were down close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed a translation, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the price is weighed by Russian bans on imports of food which have suppressed food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer with a short target," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the decrease in prices.
The large trading chains of the S group and Kesko have both reduced their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as the most visible advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost diet, even though the price of food has fallen largely.
In 2015, food was in Finland the fourth most expensive EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food to be sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that, if the comparative countries had the same rate of VAT, in Finland, thirdly sold the lowest food from the same countries.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparative countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to old EU levels at the price of food, VAT must be halfway to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete with prices," Lehtinen writes.
The report points out that the calculations made by him at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same.
One returning to the school bench may notice that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is the instruction that all schools in Finland are operated.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells us the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old instructions.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty works is abandoned, and instead, the schools are being trained on the coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read by four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's long-term spine was found. The ice shark could live for up to 400 years.
The known grenade shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches the maturity of the family only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in today’s world.
In the animal, it passes only on the Islamic herb whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks are floating along North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females delay dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five feet.
As growth is slow, according to associations, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the ice sharks of adults from 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio silicon release of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks investigated was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish of the sample, amazons of 493 and 502 cents, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that glaciers reach only four metres of maturation, researchers declined to be about 150 years of age at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann's fire to almost 300 - the sellers will not be reduced.
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from the stockman company.
The cooperative companies in the company in which they were in trouble ended at the beginning of August.
"At the result of the negotiation, approximately 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are being made redundant," says Stockmann in his communication.
According to this, the number of sellers in the commodity sector is not reduced in order to ensure that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann's yt-negotiations were about 3 000 employees.
At the start of these, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining profitable from the store.
Although the adjusted business result of the group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, commodity stores are still losing.
According to Stockmann v CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in commodities have not reached the company's objectives.
Unfortunately, the reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive business results are achieved in 2018," says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was based, in particular, on the Lindex's good success in the clothing chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results for the best second quarter of all time.
The operating profit of the Lindex increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's turnover will be reduced last year.
The corrected business results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rain in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, reports the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
The middle parts of the country also have rainbows, but southern is from the pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, because the mercury in the whole country remains less than 20 degrees.
The northern rain zones remain at 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenya general sports team is shaken by a strange explanation for the dopingskandaal - coach’s temper
The Kenya general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home to the Olympics at the Rio after it turned out that Anzrah played as a sportsman in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that an athlete when Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-foot star of Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, part of the Kenya League Team, told us that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a surprise test sample as Rotichina.
Doping officials came to announce the Anzrah authorities.
According to the Soin, Anzrah was sent home because he was "a crime against Kenya's country team."
He played as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", the Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on the other hand, rode the news office for Reuters.
The Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich will run immediately.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich took place last year in MM races on the way to the fourth and is preliminary to Rio’s winner recommendations.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's Athletic Team claimed that Anzrah traveled with an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race pool.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was tested.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Sports Stadium is diminishing its vacuumity
Where is everybody?
At least, at the Olympic Stadium of Rio, they aren't following sports.
On Friday, Rio started a struggle for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top individuals were able to show their skills confusing to an empty viewer.
On Friday, Rio’s organisers told us that only 58% of the first-day morning race tickets and 65% of the night race tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium sang out of the hurrage.
The final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
Rio’s Olympics has already attracted attention before the sports.
For example, thousands of empty seats have appeared in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people’s view was filled.
At least the bad move explains the fact that Brazil, who struggled with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian racers, and many of the Olympic species are strange for the used Brazilians in football.
Even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not be filled with football stadium.
In the weekend, Mario Andrada, the director of the competition directors, told us that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
From the 8,5 million Olympics in London, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics in London, Volunteers and Army staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have provided 240 000 tickets to schoolers in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
With Rio stadium, there were plenty of vacancies in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in the sand of Copacaba has not been of interest to the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
There's a lot of people in the papers.
New way of protecting nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the protection of nature by means of new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
Afterwards, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders with money in the territory of the country.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The country is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by willing persons against the payment of the right of holders.
The holder shall receive a right of veto in its 187 square block, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is intended to be changed.
The rights of holders can also be acquired for several segments.
Acquisition of administrative law is something concrete that can be left as a heritage or gift.
There is no need to go and carry bands or shackle itself somewhere to protect nature," the Juha Leviäkangas, who acquires the right to control his company, justifies.
The managing authority receives accurate location information from its section, which enables visits, for example, in the block.
The names of the owners of rights acquired on the Foundation’s website are handsome in the same map as the country’s block data.
The only risk that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea is its nature protection procurement.
The Helsinki Foundation is established as a general interest foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
It is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way in an unethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and calm.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more defence countries.
It also aims outside the Finnish borders and plans to land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Shop on August 13-19.
The bike thieves torture the biggest cities of Turku - look at the situation of your municipality.
Bicycle thieves torture Turku at the worst of the great cities in Finland.
In this year, more wheels than nine other major cities have been stolen in proportion to the population.
Helsinki Sanomat explained on the basis of the bike thievings reported to the police, the amount of bicycles and parts thereof have been stolen in ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, four to five bikes were stolen per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two cycling thieves were notified to the Espoo and Kouvola police for a thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thieves occurs in proportion to the population compared to others," characterises police inspector Tommi Ree of the police government.
Turku's police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of the security can be influenced by how much the city moves with wheels and how many wheels there are at the top," thinks Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise at the top.
The number of bicycle thievings goes largely according to what are study and bicycle shops.
There is a close centre in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where the city centres are distant and the bike is not necessarily a priority tool," Reen says.
In Finland as a whole, the police have become a little less cycling thieves than during the previous year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police learn a little more than 20 000 cycling thieves every year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime report on cycling, although less than every ten cases reported to the police will be found.
Typical solved cycling is where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in their blood.
"There will also be cases in the context of other investigations when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught on a weekly basis or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He believes that wheels are stolen, for example, from the market centres’ wheels, indoor yards, warehouses and bike watches, which is practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The number of individual bike models is most stolen in the past years, like Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other kinds of locks.
For example, some thieves take a bike for their short-term use, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up in sales, for example through the Internet.
They're staying on the domestic market.
"Of course, the police have not come to know that stolen wheels would go much abroad," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finnish.
Some of them must buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be committed to a concealing crime or a violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if good-looking bikes are sold at the lowest price," says Reen.
Sever Hirvi, a special library official, always wears a colorful Nopsan for his working day to cover the library of Kallio in Helsinki.
The wheels he's had five copies, but none of them have been stolen, the monster says. "It's never been taken, it's been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may be no hipsterial value here," the Helsinkian Monster wonders.
Movei Valve, a quick dealer in Helsinki's Kallio Kioski, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike beat the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike into something solid, like a wheelchair.
"Because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student of his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"Oh, all the time, the friends hear that the wheels have been stolen."
"Most bad wheels, that kind of ugly Jops."
They stole a bike from their guards a year ago from the housekeeper's inner courtyard.
Although the bike had been unlocked, Valve could expect it to be clogged.
The under 15-year-olds in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peers familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer review team is being attempted to prevent young people from entering the crime round.
At first, the experiment will be applied to people under the age of 15 who are now under criminal liability.
The comparator board is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer board will discuss what has happened with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender may be able to join the peer crew in order to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"Everything guides a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything does not ruin the first mistake," says the Institute.
The model of the United States has been taken into account by the comparative lighting crew, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not go before the adult panel, but reflects what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service formator of Palmu Iikka Lovio, who followed the test, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences of people under the age of 15 have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep on the road you choose," Lovio says.
The Comparative Lighting Team is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youth, based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio underlines that new ways of action are offered to all those who need it, not just for young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican agents want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
It is said that more than 70 powerful Republicans have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
From the letter, the U.S. Journal Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
Signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his carelessness, incompetence and recording discomfort threaten to bring to the Democrats in these elections a belt," says the letter Politico.
Only direct orientation of all possible funds to congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing on a day-to-day basis.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the officials of the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposed Trum.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "from people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions of Donald Trump, believed to have offended millions of voters.
It is also said that he has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously on this week, 50 officials working on national security reported in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton permits relief for American children's families
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, candidate for the President of the Democrats, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president in order for the economy to go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part through rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handicraft for American duunars who suffer after the factories move into the lands of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay the tax of departure, Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages", said Clinton.
According to the speculations published before the Washington Post, Clinton was planning to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "only favours millionaires like this".
Trump's suggested discount on corporate taxes has previously been appointed by Clinton "Trump's pork hole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton drove.
These are Rio’s audiences: The cats have not glued Finnishs to the squares, but mobile applets are interesting
Usually, the sports races appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tops.
Rio’s Olympics have so far not reached the vast number of viewers.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have glued the races to the end of the squares: Tuesday night’s swimming was followed by 615 000 people from Top Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
In view of the comparison, almost 800 000 audiences received a month ago European sports races at the TV2 at the same time, and the EM football races were fairly another million.
For the time being, the most interested of the Olympic Games have been the Sunday night biking and the fifth race day opening a tennis gymnastics that reached the Olympic Channel at the same time nearly half a million viewers.
Yle sports leader Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience numbers, and reminds us that the audiences are divided in the Rio Olympics for the first time in a number of different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnishs are following the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with the large number of TV viewers who choose the Olympics.
Even on the TV side, the viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics are the first sports races to which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all over the time 20 000 to 50,000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than the 2012 London competitions or the 2008 Beijing tournaments, but the difference is explained by the difference in time - a large part of Rio's races will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the dim interest - if someone thinks it's dim - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the first races to a surprise medal, interest would have come up with it.
In addition, general sport is just about to start, as are other Finns interested species: sailing and riding.
The initial viewers have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkise.
When athlete begins, the number of audiences explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile application, which rose up in the first days of the races at Applen App Store, became the most charged free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"The counts of the blood will only be later." Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users, as hoped.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems at the initial stage.
Applications have obtained updated versions that should correct errors.
Rio’s Olympics will be seen more widely on Top's channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and the Yle Talk is on the radio to pass the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the workplaces for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports can be seen on both Top and Commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Ristinsel.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, an engineering sub-trainer, found a weight of about 20 square metres from the Ristisel, which was at the depth of the diving computer 104 metres.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to inevitably strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not necessarily be found in a small deepened hundred metres, says developing engineer Jari Hakala.
So until now, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Second Water and Main Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sun Lake.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake hasn't been carefully scanned.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is determined by the mid depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
With this in mind, your sun will not get into the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvesi is still farther from the top.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14.29: The last copy corrected with the deepest lakes in the middle was wrong.
From the Irish tax base: Taxation of pensioners is increasingly tighter
Retirement taxation remains more stringent than employees.
The admirer says that an inconvenience occurred under the parliamentary elections and the tax of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received work income reductions, which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the issue warmed up the representatives of the opposition, who swept out of the election promises of the Minister for Finance at the moment Alexander Stubb.
Buying power will be secured, it will not grow
In the guidelines presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.), the tax reductions are mainly due to safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
The admirer is pleased by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo's messages for the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it should not be struggled by questioning.
It will be needed because the economy is so much at the expense of domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
Inconsistent with long-term unemployment
The admirer calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17,000 more in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of an increase in employment rate will run away to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims are known to be attacked in Thailand
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland's time.
The Embassy calls on the Finns in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns' seats in Thailand to cancel their journeys due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale says.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to assess their exact number.
The Finnish Travel Period for Thailand is due to a change in the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish embassy of Finland has received some comments from the Finnish embassy in Thailand via Facebook after bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finnish people in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No data on the author
According to Westphalen, there's still no record of the offender.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the last week's referendum to the constitution drawn up by the military junction.
The law was adopted in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people who declared themselves against the law were arrested in the country.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphale.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local celebration in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
According to him, the queen's birthday and mother's birthday are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise of safety.
Thai police: No international terrorism is involved in attacks
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Also, Islamic terrorism has been excluded, says Thai Police News Office AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, the popular tourists.
The Finnish tourist destination also, at the holiday island in Phuket, blew four bombs at night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the paper.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, four bombs have been exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than and the city of Trang, at least one bomb was exploded in both South Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is transported to the holiday islands of Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The author of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military train in Thailand, the offender has not yet been known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusing.
We don't have to make people panic more, he told the journalists.
According to Deputy Secretary General for Security, Mr Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that it was the purpose of the authors to destroy the tourism of the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls for the Finnish people to be watchful and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns who are going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but we should follow the guidelines of caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about attacks and victims that have occurred during the night of Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been given some time to get more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians amongst the victims.
At least three people were wounded in the last attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in sight near the known clock tower.
The Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin that he thinks he's found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower cottage, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN interviewed police officer says that the attack on Surat Than was also conducted with two bombs that exploded every half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's quadrilateral match
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second to 60.98 and Russian Alija Mustafina with the third 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, after Rio's races, he's still trying to get stack championships on perman, jump and boom.
The party has been in control of women's strength in the last few years.
He's got eight personal world championships from three previous years.
He has won the championships of the four match and permnancy three times in a row and the boom in the last and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has reached two team competition world championships.
More MM medals on the party have jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Father has no influence on tourism"
In Thailand, in Phuket, Esa Huovila, which runs a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that this will result in any more wonderful outcomes, the Huovila worked in Asia as a Finnish entrepreneur for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedys that have been tested near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't expelled tourists, I don't think this is.
The company's office is located a few hundred metres from the explosion site.
The Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine o'clock from the local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the Friday holiday in Thailand.
Patongi was at a calm atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open about ten o’clock at local time.
Many had never even heard of the attacks on the beach.
Half a day in Thailand's time in Patong, traffic was normalised and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the scene of the attack, the explosion has been pretty small, says Huovila on the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupuy on Jouxholminti.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for the signs, hiding in a close sixsome.
Another man got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but later he was found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing a motor vehicle, stealing and serious damage.
The police thank the people who gave me the clues.
Research Director for Russian Directorate-General Changes: Clearly removed
On Friday, Russia had a high-ranking managerial change over the years when President Vladimir Putin separated Sergei Ivanov from the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diploma and he's been the second man of Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason Ivanov's expelling could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from collecting independent power from the president to themselves.
According to the Cangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught with other leaders or failed.
Ivanoville's deployment
Ivanov, which belongs to Putin's inside, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
By the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that it was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other tasks and suggested that persecution be replaced, said Russia Today.
The Cangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear dismantling.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role at the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
The Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is Putin's switching younger around.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in retreat in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape the city of Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received over 90 percent of the important city of Manbij in Isis last week.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists were left in the city at the time.
Previously on 7:30 p.m., we wrongly said that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Publication of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The Directorate of the Ministry of Interior regarding the publicity of documents is illegal, says professor of public justice, Tomi Voutilainen, University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian tells STT that the public document cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior refused earlier to issue the list of participants of the Minister of Interior's occasions to the Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister substantiated the decision by a guidance from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministerial Director of Communications tells STT that there is a need to reform practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the tribute races.
From the early age, he insulted his way back and had to skip the Olympics of Jamaica.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-dressed sambatants and fan-formed journalists.
With Porina Bolt, it underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the era when a general sport has struggled with dopingskandaals and skating interest.
Bolt's previous loss in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he fell off at the beginning of 200 metres at 21,05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and relaxed training weapon.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, in which he crushed the final celebration of the world record and competitors, despite the end of the celebration of their competitors, 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, in Berlin's MM races, Bolt reached his career at the legal point of the watch.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred meters and 19.19 on two hundreds are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200 yards world record and 19 seconds below, but no one else believes in the birth of it but Bolt himself.
A hundredth Bolt's very challenge is Ateena's 2004 100 Olympic Winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing MM Final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost the final time in the ranking races during his contemporary reign in Beijing, if only he has made his way.
In the dawn of 2011, the 100-dollar MM finalal was not running from Bolt because of the false departure.
Bolt fills a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
For the last goal line of the career, Bolt has set up next year's MM races in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exhibits from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of doping crime
According to Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
The Bulgarian drinker, Silvia Daneko, is also suspected of doping crime.
In addition, the Kenya general athletic coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She was in Rio for the fourth place in women's 100 yard butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken its doping cases to address the CAS of the International Court of Petitions of Sport.
Xinhua says that the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday has shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reported that Bulgarian women's drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
On the other hand, Kenia has sent Rio to his home for the doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee of KOK reported that the Kenya coach had acted as a sportsman in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenya's fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps. Historical gold came in the show style.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic History, Michael Phelps, U.S., swims in 200 metres in the mix of 22 Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps arrived as the first swimmer of the same species in the fourth successive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was placed in a mix-up second before China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympics Commissioner Helen Skelton is laughing at the Night Leaf Interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (also on Monday is the most read this week on the Night Magazine website.
Behind commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if some or some British magazines have a small amount of her revealing and special costumes.
Television is a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton's dressed up in high-cost shoes and shortshirts with at least enough revealivity - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and little things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be shaking and perhaps to be shocked, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has passed since Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how much these swimmers work and how great sacrifices they make, is okay for me, Skelton sneezes.
You know what?
It's a clue of empty, if it comes from dressing (runner).
I'm a little funny if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio's police took two arrests for a terrorist suspect.
On Thursday, Rio's police announced that it has arrested two people for suspecting terrorism.
The police took arrests during the security surveillance of the races.

7 special things that scientifically prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into the lives of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, however, things that a person cannot influence can bring on him more years.
These include the tendency to average body fatigue or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong the age.
You don't always have to spoil, just picking up a milk bag.
A long-term secret has been sought to solve a number of different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange results.
Science says that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
The study at Harvard University concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the risk of decreasing death, especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, they're talking again about studies that considerably use of one of the three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who were not drinking at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the person’s life even for more than six years, a study explains.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents nipple infections.
However, they can contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The study in Norway revealed how laughing had an impact on human life.
More than 54,000 people were monitored by a project lasting seven years.
The people who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the end of the test.
Sex, when sexual protection has been taken into account, many research indicates that health is good.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex like that is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also receive an orgasm.
Of course, sport brings more years, it is not a dispute.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute conspiracy.
A study at the University of Oxford found that the levels of cholesterol were lower for women with a big back.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these facts with lower mortality.
It was then an athlete for the Olympic Meters or an Oscar winner, he is more likely to live longer than the usual one.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings up his life for more years.
However, some researchers suspect that the long age is due to the social status of a person, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on the shopping behaviour of over 65-year-olds found that a person who shops daily, i.e. a parent who is likely to make shopping less frequently.
This is because running in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So, count the credit card from your hand, so the online shop does not have the same effect.
The ugly-humane DUI fell towards the truck.
On Friday night, Koskeke in Varsinais-Suomen, a serious truck and passenger car's belt collar took place.

Wish of a woman who was murdered in Lovian: Remembering the victim for the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and adresses for the police dog work.
The Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it carries out the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and also performed his nurse’s training there.
The veterinary station remembers the words touching a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and unbearable work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go to the police dogs as a whole, first and foremost to the purchase of security boats.
Last Friday, a 42 - year - old lovich woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisan Koskenkylä.
The women's neighbors have told the Evening League that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was killed in the arrest situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Circumstantial Court convicted Post of the infringement of the Equality Act.
The post did not have the right to arrest the employee’s salary of the person who refused to study, to assess Kanta-Häme’s court in his judgment.
Post was obliged to pay the employee most of the salary arrested and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the salary of an introductory person who was responsible for the part of the day’s work.
According to the law of the court, the worker had, contrary to the law of equality, been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his professional association activities.
The worker had followed the Union for Postal and Logistics on the prohibition of access to PAU’s organisational decision.
During the last year's postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers would not be familiar with tenant workers who broke the strike.
The People News first told me about it.
Returning Turkey to a road respecting human rights

Putin fired the commander of his administration and replaced the Estonian-fashioned persecution.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has separated Sergei Ivanov from the Head of the Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
He's going to be replaced by Karl Vaino's son, Anton Vaino, Communist Director of the Soviet Viro.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired his commander.
According to the Kremlin Communication, Ivanov, which is part of Putin's intimate interior, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other tasks and suggested that persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's spying.
Many considered Ivanov possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
In 2011, Ivanov was appointed president before Putin reeling in 2012.
BBC: ManU's gigantic buy-in to the prohibition of the game will not be seen in the opening of the Valioliiga.
The world recorder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England Valioliiga is kicked on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Because of Paul Pogba's prohibition, Manchester United's giant purchase is on the side of ManU, opening his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, said BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid Pogbasta Italian Society Juventus EUR 105 million.
However, the FA will keep him out of the game, because Pogba left Juvenus to be a ban on the game.
He received two warnings in the Italian cup of last season, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, and the FA told BBC.
The next seam in Pogba to play is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In the Flow, the madness of greatness is the virtue.
The precise criteria for enjoyment and ambitious visions have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally respected event targeted by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festerial drivers have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
One of the headband artists this year is the punk legend of Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stalled, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have just a headship and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind the success: What event would the authors themselves like to go?
It's kind of unusual in the inconvenient to think like this.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official orders, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to finish this year too.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors in the last year by 5,000 people.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists are seen in the festals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is something to finance.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle flock that is controlled on the huge routes.
That's not what we want.
During 13 years, the successful event has been soaked with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main platform and smaller stages this year, 15 000 tents of people operate.
The collio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of Helsinki in the mid-2000s.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's company amounted to around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "creeches too", like the construction of that 73-foot tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a special fashion.
We want to break up first and foremost with the content.
Yet the fashion phenomena also match the value of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the headband artists is a punk legend, Iggy Pop, 69 years old.
A man has a huge fan crowd in his own genre, but he is not indierock, pop music, rapping and soul-combined festivals.
According to the cliff, Iggy was bucketed because it is probably the last time we see this in Finland.
We're all interested in history and future.
It's not just what the commercial radio calls.
Iggy's last album is a hell of a good one, and he's done a hell of a job in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flowers' bags, and the tourists fled in their horror.
In Hua Hin, two bombs blew up locally on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs must have been hidden in a flower bag and exploded with phones.
The bombs were placed in the street, most of which are foreign.
They were exploded at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returned to their hotels, said the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, the protector of wild animals, who lived in Asia, took a great picture of their attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of the injured persons in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran against him and said that the bomb was exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after this, the Finns also favored two bombs exploded on the Phuket Island.
No one's known to be dead.
At the same time, the Hua Hin had another double bombing attack.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, there was a bomb in Trang's city.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which hadn't been able to explode yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimates that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken seriously into action by criminal organisations dealing with human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new forces will start at war first
In the acute war situation, armed men are only ordered to do battle missions only after several months of swearing a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Head of Education of Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5,5 months of military service, only those who are at the end of their training are able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, firstly, the emergency personnel are assigned to the service.
Sonninen says, no armor or reserve is assigned to a mission that has not been trained as required.
Previously on the summer, the Defence Forces began to train craftsmen to direct capacity units from the next year.
Units may be used for military action, if necessary, in the course of military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a hard fight on the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The commercial price of a two-layer separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious humidity problem in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the matter to trial and demanded a discount from the seller there.
The seller disputed the demand, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court court.
The court delivered a judgment on the matter on Wednesday.
It maintained a judgment in the court of the court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's trial and examining costs of EUR 47 344.
The right to a slightly lower price was reasonable because some of the housing needs had been known to the buyers for the sale of dwellings.
However, according to court law, the manifested construction errors were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
In court court, Tola said that the couple had specifically searched for good homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the impression that the building has been renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness review report are not harmed.
The rehabilitation inspection report identified ventilation as risk and inconvenience and the lack of adequate management of casting rain and melting waters along clipping.
On the basis of the discussions, however, it did not appear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma found that rain waters coming from the rock should be controlled a little within a few years.
Trading was carried out in October 2009.
In a few years it was evident that the humidity problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed a microbial growth in the building, which, according to the witnesses, resulted from both rock rainwater and capillary ground humidity.
On the western side of the house, air contaminated by microbies could, according to the inspector’s estimate, be accessed through the portal to indoor spaces.
A healthy risk that exceeds the limit values was found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room windowier and the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the dwelling was extended contrary to a building permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo that the housing had been subject to unauthorised modifications.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were still no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to court law, buyers could assume that, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to trade, the building was suited for its own residence and that it was not necessary for large-scale repairs in the near future.
According to Tola and Waroma, there was no particular reason to carry out more extensive inspections.
Buyers have not ignored their accountability, the court court states in their judgment.
A scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - in the register also Finnishs
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archive of the United States in Maryland has documents recorded on microfilms with a total of 218 500 women who wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also involve Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish women, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazimorsiam.
Documents and registration cards originate from the Racial Office in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under Heinrich Himmler, head of SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had examined the SS doctor.
The same was true to the greater extent of women who had to be able to give birth to up to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological investigations to investigate the case.
Among other things, the Racial Office examined women’s backgrounds by examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women were also expected to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give a handwritten life stories and good recommendations to the Racial Office.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "bearing children", "saving", and "good national socialists" who knew well in Germany.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's bride.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very active, reports on the websites of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother’s honorary Christian was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were prohibited in law, the museum's pages are stated.
The Sixth of Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing day of Finnjollie’s first departure at the Rio Olympic Games, but the whole crowd remained the top of the day’s second departure.
In the whole situation, the Nirkko rose up to eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in position 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at RS:X day departures in 17 and three.
In general, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In 470 grades, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained at the beginning of the day 23.
In general, the Lindgrens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satlinna was recorded with a couple of hours' nights sleep: "I was so busy."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favourite artifacts for over 20 years.
From the Rising Ship bartender to the Tango King of 1995, the soloartist of Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, the Sillanpää can continue to porches and is currently in a steep lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppis, about the life of the favorite song, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells us about his life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the bridge rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tango King’s crown in the Tango Market of the Wall River in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangs, but he had planned a little different music for himself.
In spring 1995, Jukka Kuopamäki had compiled a tango piece, at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen made in a slightly different form.
The piece of sadtulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of night sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so busy!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You don't know how much you're gonna do about the recording of a huge hit, right now you wouldn't think it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically my best, the trail was good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfect and top all the time.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of a man, reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and finally the case ended up with you in the gold piece texts that were published singlely in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäse were not what the Sillanhead would like.
The bridge had imagined being making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the differential song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a complete puppet and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British themselves were surprised by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters had a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the week's opinion measurements anticipated the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the highly respected research institutes or university flagged the difference, although a few individual researchers agreed to disagree with the mainstream of their professions.
The main theme of Western policy, the former President of the US, Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid", flew into the junk in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy seemed not to be the main issue of politics.
Economic harsh language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in his latest monthly survey responds to the Brexit disaster.
The answer of the type is that the economists were not heard because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by the economists on the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workers, which is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the real British.
Many also have the idea that the currency value decrease would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Council, the voters did not believe financial arguments because the unanimity of economists was not sufficiently raised.
In particular, they were reduced by the equilibrium of the BBC, which provided just as much space for a few% of economic scientists representing the economic diversity of the EU than for an overwhelming majority.
The EU-responsive press was not interested to tell us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic constraints about the consequences of the difference were.
These far-reaching combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist messages were both listened and understood, they were not passed on because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think there are common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congest your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants, too.
How much easier would the children of the real British get to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more room would the originals have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond and, if they succeeded, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have increased jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and particularly immigrants in the EU - are the net payers of the UK public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen's Real Estate Fund was prepared for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the profit of a differentiating camp, started to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left.
It was concerned that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have large liquidity assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the Fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says that Aberdeen's only open daily records of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At that time, the fund was worth 3.5 billion quid.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10 % or even below it.
Thus, the building funds prepared very different strategies for Brexit.
Funds closed trading
When the differentiating camp won, Europe went confused.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, President of the Central Bank of England, in which he considered that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freeze his trade.
These together robbed the situation and put it on the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund had to close its doors.
The situation of Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very quiet for a few weeks, Vanhanen tells.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar impact on the Aberdeen Manner European Funds.
However, there was a lot of surveys.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closure of the real estate funds was unreasonable.
Open funds covered by closures are managed by about four per cent of the UK property.
Aberdeen's lock lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 of its property in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that they might hold their funds on the side of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not appear to be "anger" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the UK economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The GBP/dollar course is lowest for 30 years, with 15% discount sales on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar investor can now buy the same property by up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of wanting buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look much like it yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, revived to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this goes to plan B, the Oldman says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
Normally, the TV screens in the office were sound-free, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell her that she was divorced this morning.
When the market opened, the ends of the evidence were flashing from the red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd live, the Old man says.
It is not, therefore, that in spite of mystery, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finalised two real estate stores after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leaders switched.
The market started to anticipate severe landings for the real estate markets in Britain and especially London.
Up to 20% of mines were anticipated in London's offices in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the giggle's down, but in the air it's still insecure.
However, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of primary information.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to these, the prices of all real estates in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, mine accumulated 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months' changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All similar falls occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and to the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate markets.
According to the old man, the parable is not entirely appropriate, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another tunnel.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that, but willingness to sell liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's a financial jacket, too.
The repair movement could have been in front of it anyway.
As a matter of fact, the price repair business is not a miracle for him, it could have been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world’s first cities have been too high for years.
For two years, we have said that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, Oldman says.
So the drop started very high.
London's prices are rising up for four reasons, the old list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London, as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that becomes globalised, Oldman says.
New players have become marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city, an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, for example, pension companies have been forced to seek income from new items.
On this issue, the loan has been easily available - although the debt line has been used by the Old Man now clearly less than the buum before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse.
In London, the price rise was set last summer, Vanhanen tells us.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce his ownership in London, and he was a net salesman last year.
There was some kind of turning to be expected, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Oldman.
A lot he dares to assess the future, but he says there's hardly any swing on the rise.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a decreasing or even course ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes to dismantle the world.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much victims.
If you've dispersed, the risks are also decentralised, Vanhanen says.
The S group begins to register purchase information more closely than before
Point S knows what you eat, because the trade group said that today it was beginning to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its stock customers.
Once data have so far been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will also begin to hug it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group is coming here after Kesko, as the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to the Executive Director of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitalan's return from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific information shall be collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing authorisations.
The most efficient channel is an e-mail.
There are quite few customers who have denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
In his opinion, Kesko is not going to react to a change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko is already classifying its stock customers according to only food purchases into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Information is used for targeted marketing.
Purchase information per product is collected only from the K group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, will not be given their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a stock client program or such a program.
The Middle Shop in Finland has its own one-Bosbonus stock client program, which can be included in the Choice Houses, Siwas and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group data, we remain at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the shops were purchased, and on the day and the client's final receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like a K group or a S group, says a commercial leader, Anu Ora.
He believes that the stock client programme will continue to be reformed, but the Neighbourhood Commerce will report on it later.
However, the Ora does not authorise that product information would be subject to registration.
Trying at the beginning
The SOK customer and customer register has still been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included professions, training, housing, children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Etucards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, the final amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, information from the S bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data of the product level are started to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terrors and ABC chains, the data are recorded at the product group level.
For a longer time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be more specific, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK's customer owner and partner business.
The S group says that he should inform his customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored in bags anyway, wanted it or not.
The desired person can check his stored information on the S group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to the information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila-Boy is the latest confirmation of the Customs - the kid becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador-outer's kid is heavily squeezed by five similar types of box in line at Helsinki-Vanta Airport.
It won't take long to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat reveals a bottle of seals that exploded to the grid gas.
Steam gas is the first scent that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for firearms and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Jobs may also take Heila and Suntio to other crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
In Tull, the attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures and after the attacks, surveillance has been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another way to train a gun and explosive corridor is postal broadcasts via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of growing internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments are carried through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the Customs has made about 300 of the purchases of online shops, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport with regard to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their sources.
Heila will work across Helsinki.
It's going to investigate the recorded baggage and mailings.
In the ports, it will be a major benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Greenberg.
Based on the performance of the sound, Customs will assess whether further training of weapons and explosives will be made in the future.
Grönberg hopefully sees the idea.
School at the Church Nurse
The training of the Heila-Peneum is coordinated by the School of Dogs of Customs, located on the Church Numme.
Suntio also trains with Heila at police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defense Forces with expertise in explosives.
The customs office together with the other authorities will decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
The beech is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
The Heila colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador's caterer Heila has been selected from 10 puppies' puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog to be chosen at the airport include a leap and a hunting voyage, as well as peace as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to get home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
The delicate orders are going to Heila's place from the one-pack.
Tonight's cameraman loses the camera cap on the fast dog, but Heila restores the soft toy cap right away from the "open" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
The initial training of the helicopter will be completed next year.
There are still level tests to be carried out next in October, assessing whether training is sufficient for the required work.
The Heilan can be seen in work on Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to the plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to silk the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
One working dog costs approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they are retired for the care of their owner.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active working hours will last from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the workers' dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
He picked up some 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministries got their first Olympic Medal... the people get a day off.
In Rugby the Olympic Gold of Fidži, less than a million inhabitants, the government has appointed the national day of August 22.
According to the public broadcasting company, the Fidži Government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off will be held for the team to return home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their own country.
Fiji's rugby team party championship.
The Guardian tells us that the country was followed by a final in the capital of Suva, where the stadium had a set screen.
Normally, only the naive Fijis are interested in Rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, heard them encouraging, said the editor of Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish writer fainted after a wild performance
The weight provider Milko Tokola succeeded in his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the penalty lifts, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
Tokola got 175 pounds and 145 pounds in Rio.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last 175 pounds, as well as one another.
In the third attempt, the weights were rising with the hurricane screaming.
The body was shaking under weight until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish minister was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virola wanderer in Prosan - A betting leaga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, who plays a football league, has concluded a long-term agreement with the official cheerleader Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for the top player of our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovanieme is small.
With more than ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players all over the world.
Prosa, the coach of RoPS Juha Malinen, became a good option to separate from the group.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from a stable Flora, where he made 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played in Estonia's country team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemeans meet the Finnish master's SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal queen Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The threat to the Modern Family Star again: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern family comedy series, nice Alex Dunphyna, has become familiar with Ariel Winter again by showing his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at the minihorts that don't leave much for imagination.
Shorts uncovered not only the actress' legs but also this ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior much more bold.
The star has posed in the pictures published in social media in very few clothing and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing very short clothes.
Winter on the nail of adulthood has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it from here.
Previously on this summer, Fox News asked the experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In that case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected Winter had a "typical Hollywood change" from the star of childhood to adulthood.
He's been on television almost all his life and grew up during the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has disgusted some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to know where he is in ten years, when the fall is so hard now, a woman in Winter's Instagram says.
However, some of the women's fans are defending an actor and urged not to listen to criticisms.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're an inspiration for many women. You're a young woman.
The Japanese preferably want the Nordics to go to Finland - tourists are attracted to the recession: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy mirror in Aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their retreats from the beginning, Visit Finland will report in the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese camping.
Recess fires are artificial cards in our winter trip and are strongly combined with heart winter and snow landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, there is a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of the autumn trips.
Few people know that the recession season begins from early autumn and continues far to spring.
At the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror Aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the rear flames by making two multitudes of a saturated vision, says Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who are dreaming about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey carried out by the Aalto University and by the researchers at the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the Japanese as compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more explicit sights of Finland, and Lindi said that the revontulus has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed over double in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland's tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
The British will be satisfied with the rugbyhopean master class organized by Fid, leading to gold.
The impressive progress of the UK in the rugby tournament collapsed to the last challenge that Fidz put forward in the final of Thursday night, when the team experienced a 43-7 breakdown at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master class for handling, chewing, snacks, support games, runlines, and snacks when they won gold, their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work at the opening of the Olympics' Rugby tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 wins of the semifinal played earlier on the same day from South Africa could have troubled them in the final.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won in this condition a 15-human high-quality team.
Great Britain may be... but probably not comforting the fact that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former British boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, when Ryan was trained, they lost every game at the Adelai tournament.
There's only one thing they lost.
It hurts, but it's an astonishing development.
Fidi was a great start in combating the British fights for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running towards moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the goal zone.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side resulted in a target shot.
12-0, and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant strike stopped a man mountain from making a third goal, Leone Nakarawa, but it was just a slow shot for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right corner, and the United Kingdom had 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made the goal of a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the watch... for the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou struck through the stairs found in Britain and jumped on the line to make a paint.
After the shot, it was 29-0 when we got a break.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the United Kingdom just learned the game.
And that's exactly what it is.
On a break UK made a lot of changes that blocked Fid's dam... for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half-time until Josua Tuisova made the goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton grabbed the UK when making the touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the situation to number 36-7, but for a long time the game had been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose supporters were singing, swinging tickets and dancing in sights.
It was difficult not to admire Fid’s delightful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute painting was a glue in Fid's cake that didn't need cherries.
The pillar was swept, the Philians hugged, and the Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Previously on the same day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semifinal 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in a tight semifinal, where both of them made one goal -- the UK goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took the lead in South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a shining footwork and made a goal under the target columns in the second half.
A great late strike from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother in England's 15-Aside Rugby team, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer stretched Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to the war victory.
In these races there will be no emotions of more dreadful gold, and that really means something.
From the first draw to the last, 220 to the hard race towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in Estacio da Lagoa in their golden moment.
Even though they played alone, there were three votes on the boat, and the coach Robin Williams had been present all the time when the twins would be in the second successive Olympic cultures of women - the first women in British sports history books that would reach such a achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th performance undefeated, which is also record.
This is what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting the surface with the swan's lockness, not entirely the nature of the victory.
In the background of each gold of war, a group of helpful pairs that progressively promote the things that have meaning, and no pair of hands was as essential as the coach who did not have 30 months ago know whether he would live until this day.
As he said, the situation was very close.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they had surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trinity was lucky that his treatment was able to start outside the period at the beginning of 2014, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if it could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, walking around the department, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
It's a journey, but it'll make it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first few thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Army regimen in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional misery this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me, how much me and Helen, and Robin, too, have worked.
The last three years have been great with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he owes great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost competition in five years.
A couple set up a tough rhythm that their competitors didn't pick up.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the store.
We were very attached in a moment.
Helen yelled, "Spy in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years before he decides about his future.
Glover's going to be at the wedding next month when he's getting married to a TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this is my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland switches to the Government of Panama, which has been confined to Panama
Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections in October, which are demanded by demonstrators aroused by Panama's data leaks in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed the circumvention of taxes by a number of Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Mr Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson broke up because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s recent spring rage affects the outcome of the autumn election.
During the June presidential elections, the criticality of the authorities was clearly evident and the President was elected Gudni Johannesson, who was not in the political position.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The President of the Republicans of the United States Donald Trump canceled his latest atrocities.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clintonk.
The Democrat Party was upset by speeches and demanded apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone down like that, Clinton, be the chief of the army.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has denied the use of the Muslims’ popular cover-up burkine swimsuit in swimming pools, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming is prohibited by anyone who does not have a good way and a bathing suit that respects culturalism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious links, can increase the risk of irregularities in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In the mid-July 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31 - year - old man drove into the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations joined Daddy attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu area crossed the sieve - Blue samentum in the toilet lake
The water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Bluefin dust has only been observed on the bathing shore of the Towel Lake.
During the Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action of the Oulu region took water samples from nine coasts of the Oulu region and 30 other general beaches.
Excluding the sea coast, the concentrations of all bathing areas of E.coli and intestine gastrointestinal gastrointestinal bacteria were below the operational limits laid down by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus were secured in the sea bathing area during Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue sand found on the beach of the toilet lake does not yet make the water unsuitable, but in favour of favourable conditions, the situation can quickly change as a blue flower, thus forming on the surface as blue-green floats.
The environmental action will monitor the situation by enlarged inspections.
If the blue sanctuary becomes a blue flower, it shall also be reported separately on a bathing beach notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen’s forest gift reduction: over 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Act of Income Tax proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a generation of the forestry exchange tax.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forestry exchanges, to youngen the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forestry and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would reduce the clean income of forestry capital.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry farms is good, commenting on Juha Hakkarainen, Head of Forestry Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers.
However, the perpetrator finds a critical tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is presented as a function of the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could directly result from the sales of wood.
The proposal for a VM provides that by decreasing the clean income of the forestry will prevent the loss of forestry capital income, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if he didn't sell a tree.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the value of the forest’s income is EUR 40 000.
He thinks it's too high.
In such a way, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners would be cut off from the land.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In the forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been withdrawn for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.

An accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga to a few miles from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer cancer increases the malignancies of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to respond to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the studies were published on 4 August in the valued Natural Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The murder of Muho will continue in the court, the prosecutor will also require a murder warrant for another author.
The death of Muhos' family home continues in the court of both convicteds.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of family in Muhos.
The second received eight years for four months, inter alia, the murder and the robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years imprisonment for the murder and the robbery of a young person.
The person who was convicted of killing was also convicted of the serious risk of traffic safety as a young person and the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who had been sentenced more severely were complaining of the judgment of the court.
The prosecutor demands a less punished man to be condemned for the murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked in July last year as a child protection unit instructor of the school home.
The 17-year-old who received the murder warrant attacked the judge, according to the reasons behind the director sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had got rid of the door and had tolerate his young room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The driver was also strangled, beaten and kicked.
According to the mental study, both judges were fully understood at the time of the work.
According to the court, young people had been planning to escape a family home from at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The world's longest live spine has been secured by ice shark, reports a research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, as in Greenland, a floating ice shark, or a holker, can live for up to 400 years.
She's only growing when she's 156 years old.
The life expectancy of the ice shark is that it grows only in a centimetre a year.
Only one species of hemp is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered the age with a radio steam drive.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
According to these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years of age, although a twist in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Visa - People News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would be disregarded if the change in the corporate tax led by Donald Trump is taken.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by means of the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolutionary presentation on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I'd never collect a huge amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the reduction put forward by Trump, 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of overregulating business and bankruptting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided by the Häts must be re-entered and the energy regulation must be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be taken into account.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is the main causes of the US's problems.
They'd be renounced of free trade agreements.
The Chinese imports would be charged at 45% and 35% in Mexico.
We offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our confession of faith, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American planes to combine cities, American ships to oversee the sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump read faithfully through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists, even those close to the Republicans, see Trump's programme taking the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday, Finland's time.
Attack wave of the past - People News
The sea is fateful, but the actual wave of attack is hit in the middle of the streets of Madrid. The accounting with the past can begin.
It summarised the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's news.
The previous steering work of Almodovar Travel lovers (2013) was a small fun and satiristic comedy, the predecessor skin where I live the tops of the Spanish strife's career.
Julieta (2016) is equally located somewhere between those two works.
It's an intimate, intimate, human and family drama that is at the heart of the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot as a long backup.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged denominator (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of random encounter, the new man friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be admired until the end of the film.
In the form of a back and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of his life to his adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from a TV-treatment series between Ommelten (2013-2014), will rise.
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a cunt, but I would say that it is a bit of a staggering and verbally repeated sweep.
Often the Almodóvar films have a fair distance to such a sense of explosion in Julieta.
It is evenly played, controlled, a place of good music and a rather sad-minded film with its ingredients in the elite.
Instead, the visual saturation of colours typically characterized by the Spanish instructor is retained in such a way that it begins to squeeze a little quietly into the eye more as a clean form than as an effective dramatic means of action.
Diseases, deaths, or incidental loss in the film, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a denominated person, the costumes vary from the scene to the point, and the same applies to apparent ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, the vice-definitions of this scene, too, is not better.
When mechanically recurs, the impression is external and little spiritless.
Almodóvar has made a manuscript based on three novels of Canadian Alice Munro, awarded by Nobel 2013.
The novelles have been published in The Runner: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a bit of written literature accreditation.
It would have been an emotionally unprecedented drama, that much of the big things - especially the thematics of the sleeve guilt - that would have been dealt with.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the movies is 12.8 p.m.
The government is trying to pick up the people's news.
There are no new cuts to be done, the hoisting ministers so that the Finns do not crash completely.
However, the cuts that have been completed in the spring will be carried out in a trash shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.) are convinced under the budget gap.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the VM, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of an ansionary unemployment insurance is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
Municipalities Haunting
Why do ministers so hardly emphasise the fact that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities are held in April and are the most important heat meter of the election period, not the gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the local result of the different directions of the government parties will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallutes tell us that the Government Party expects a slight loss of Finns, even though its previous elections resulted in a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the right government next spring.
The line of life of the government of the three, approximately equally large parties, is in line with the survival of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough government policy over the first year.
The first signs of the group of parliaments of the party have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the fact that new cuts will not come from the rhetoric is the fact that they will be carried out rigorously next year, and secondly, they will try to soften the attack awaiting the Finns.
Great surgery in 2018?
In a year, everything is likely to be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set a target for debt folding in this period of election, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take up EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the midst of the parliamentary period and to admit that the government cannot comply with its own programme: the debt will not go down and even slow down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This will mean even harder cuts on the former in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would at least reach a close balance in 2018, and then in the spring Parliamentary elections will take up what will come.
Debts do not fall under these measures
It is absolutely clear that debts in current actions do not fall, even though Juha Sipila is trying to squeeze a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State to Hetemäen's budget in the outsourcing report show it unanimously:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the rounds presented in the week, government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-in the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by the new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the meeting and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: Municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four consider that organising day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it is reflected in the research of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also take responsibility for a single municipality from libraries, culture, citizens' schools, building supervision, high school training and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is more clearly desired by the local cavity, special care, vocational education, vocational higher education and institutional care of people with disabilities.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are required to be transferred to the State.
A juicy underage runs after the chase, running away from the police.
Joensuu 16 - year - old motorcycle driver ran the police patrol out in Joensuu at Ilomantinti on Friday night at 7:30 p.m.
The police force tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man left to run the police off at fair speed.
The retreat continued on the Sonkajarrand road, which continues to take the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, a young man ran away, but a quicker-footed cop ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed 0.75 prom.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell down the street.
The truck in the rock cargo crashed on the Knee Lake Kaavinti on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drove to the left in a curved drive out of the road and fell on its side of the yard.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door left above, together with the rescue shelicopter staff and the first nurses.
The driver's job was to pick up the vehicle.
From the fallen truck, a hydraulic oil was spilled on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.

Observations and clues of missing movements are requested to call the North-West State Station Clue number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air... look at the gallery of the destruction of Parafest.
The flooding of the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Parafestity Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will be economically up and that the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the parafest was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the tower laval.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations to be held at the theatre's premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised in a planned manner.
A flood flow occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the form of cloud water bind the heat, so the decreasing air mass cools and speeds towards the earth.
It is reported from the Air Science Institute that several flows occur during the summer in Finland.
It's hard to predict the routes of flows.
The flood hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents crashed, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly offended.
One child was transported mildly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution depletes the Londons
According to the study, the skin of the lontooians is getting old faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
Evening Standard's on the British investigation.
The British Skin Treatment Company Caci analyses London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired lontooians is two and a half years older than, for example, an age-friend living in the countryside.
Skin aging small particles are a very fine dust pollutant from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases to which Evening Standard says nearly 9 500 lonsters die every year.
The studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those lonsters who walk their work in the vicinity of congestive streets.
London people can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but it is recommended that the skin be cleaned regularly as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes betrayed the man standing before you.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes cheated, and the tractor rolled on a man.
However, the man did not miss it, but the tractor had enough time for a pushed man to carry him to the central hospital with serious injury to further investigations.
The tractor didn't have time to flow any further, because it ran into the stones that were in front of him.

Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the MM races of the salibandy since 2003.
Now, the sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 were missed after Canada was better in the North American quarrys.
I was working in Turku and playing with a woman in that area when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was setting up a salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near the city of Elizabeth in New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when a girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
They played the blunt at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in the River Boys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing in a prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to stop as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary season.
Beach Volley's Finnish championships will be settled in Kouvolan Sports Park on weekends.
During three days, medals are played in the series of adults and young people.
The six best pairs of the ranking of each series will be eligible for the SM final tournament organised by Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Air Ballball Union.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of the Finnish beach volley peak for many years.
Today, Hasu, a resident in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people can get to the view this weekend.
I'm sure the wash stadium is coming in a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu sensation.
The Kouvolan region set Hasu on a rock and gave a good meal to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood in mind.
When I was 9 years old, I started the balloon with Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big toy shirt, knee shields in the ankles, and great ace lips and choreographics after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the Sports Society was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The joint spirit of the group created an environment that was nice to play.
All the families were very involved, and the teammate's father trained us, and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural species selection to counterweight the inner balloon.
There's been a play on the curved beach since the 1990s.
The activities have always been active in the visits.
I also went to the junior SM tournament myself, thinking that one day I'd be there myself.
Now this dream is real when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkise in SM-finals this weekend.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament of the second-tipped twin is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
Our SM gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mystery.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are awaited.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, the toe parts are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Salomon Koli went bravely as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk gains, sweats and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started working with her little brother Valtteri Koli shortly two years ago as a contributor to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Initiation as a rural enterprise meant debt and increases in order to allow the bread to come to the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been on a farm, and now that I started myself as a businessman, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we were going to build a steep shaft, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic.
I did, however, really bravely join the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger navels.
The work has resulted, for Solomon Koli has been selected to the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At the best time, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria will first report inflation to eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first number above zero after October last year, when a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The annual average inflation measured in the life cost index was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost index of life in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods was increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), leisure and culture (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), mixed goods and services (0.3 %).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month with regard to alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
The "anime" effect of snapchat is judged as an Asian caricatry
According to Snapchat, the anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to edit and play reality in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The birds are simple, facially twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie daily.
All misleadings quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticised by the accusation that the application advertises the blackface mask or favours the white skin color as a beauty grain.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them clever eyes, clever teeth and cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people, a yellow face.
And they wondered if these repeated poles could be a sign of a company's bigger problem in terms of diversity.
The news and affliction spread widespread on Wednesday, following the reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later, Snapchat said that he had ceased the characteristic.
The company provided an explanation: The lens were meant to be an honorary demonstration for the anime figures, not a caricatry of Asians.
But to observers who were racist, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes in action.
Some said no to the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose twiit photographs were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "It is difficult to argue against comparisons with the most fragile Asian caricature and filter efficiency."
It shows that the filter is not just yellow, but yellowed into extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to be attached to the endless struggle of diversity and inclusion, the corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially diverse audience of young people can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
At the interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of the Snapchat lenses creates a picture that hurts the user, it's much more difficult for these guys to be noticeless than ever.
On Thursday, Zhu, the product manager and engineer working for the Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to the Medium and in the phone interview, he said he believed that the race disputes reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat's remuneration practices.
Zhu criticised the company’s principally white man leadership and decided to write with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PhootSnapchat)
"One of their staff does not have a variety of different skin colors, which is why they can make such decisions," said Zhu, Chinese-American, "or they have different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely not responded.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss racisms of his staff, but according to his representative, the company hired a recruiter a short time ago to concentrate on reduced populations and to move forward internal inclusion efforts.
For its part, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it true that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congress panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence data.
In the report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces had edited intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war on Isise in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground were justified.
The sub-annual report of the Working Party set up by the Republican President of the Defence Committee, the Inquiry Committee and the Defence Assistance Sub-Committee founded a "special displease" among the main intelligence analysts who said that the leaders were twisting their estimates of the American efforts to win Isis.
Headquarters, known as Centro, are headquarters of Armed Forces in Florida's Tampa, who supervises US Armed Force Operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The outputs of the intelligence accepted by the Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the US's efforts to counter terrorism than the facts on the ground, which were more positive than the analyses produced by other factors of the intelligence community," said the press release of the report.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable in the war of our fighters when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ms Ken Calvert, California Republican.
The failures of the Centcom leadership will reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes the constant problems in mainland descriptions and analyses of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking administrative authorities of the Obama regime had ordered reports to be tampered, it describes the feelings of analysts as if the directors of Centrcom had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by Isis in a more positive light of the Islamic state.
"At the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates for the Congress were significantly more positive than events themselves", said the report.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to reintroduce Mosul could begin even early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in possession of Isis.
"After the months of the investigation, this is very clear," said Mrs. Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces headquarters manipulated the outputs of mainland intelligence in order to minimise Isisi's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans, after consulting the working group, established that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional ongoing investigation of Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014-2015, Centcom created an inquiry evaluation of Isis and Iraq's security forces in an insecurely isolated process", said the Committee's leader, representative Adam B. Schiff.
According to Schiff, this process "longed the publication of intelligence outputs", deteriorated the mood among analysts, and "not given enough room for divergent perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the analysts of Centrcom to reconcile their conclusions on "the previous or political story".
The Daily Beast will report on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has initiated an investigation after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
In the opinion, Captain Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress report as long as the superinspector's investigation is underway.
But he said that "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than just the question of whether the bombing operations led by the United States are successful in Iraq and Syria (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's prosecutions questioned how much President Obama can trust the headquarters to act on the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis destinations.
The review of the Islamic state intelligence reflects over a decade of doubt when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article which said that despite the opposition of several analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also in the key role of rebel concerning information on intelligence in the Islamic state.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the opposite public opinions, the air strikes against the processors controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not, however, reported outside the main facility.
Centcom's bridge commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was started to criticise last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth time in the country-hockey world, organising an intercourse with Britain
The day after having made three goals of the team in winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made Thursday of the US Women's Land Hockey team two first goals of the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the person who keeps a record of his paintings."
But this is what he knows: the Americans are at a 4-0 Olympic tournament, and they share their group first with Britain, who was still unbeatable after the victory of Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived in the quarters, and this game will decide who will be first and who will be second in their six teams.
The first person placed to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group leader, a little longer at the beginning of the quarters.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, the Americans have aroused with a surprising success here four years after they stayed at the Olympics in London for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up the landhockey club for the first time when he was three years old (because his older twin sisters played the species in Drexel) when he was 16 years old, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join his final player list.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, English, was appointed a coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the same work tactics in London as we have now.
We've made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time goaling with a rush near the paint.
India had come up with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation in 1-0 chapters until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He was carrying the ball on the left of the field for a long time, then rolling in the middle and pulling the ball to the goal, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had given one of each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Peace of trampoline in the midst of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of raging competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic spark itself is a flammable message cap, transmitted from a bowl sniper to a swimmer and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to a conversation of a neighbor in the coffee shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with a smiling smiling hole, could well be one of the names that are known for the best time of viewing and supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV ads - if he was a swimmer, a winner, or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28, from the California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic Gold in trampoline.
The Olympic League does not illuminate all the species as much.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, spring fire, feather ball, taekwondo.
We've always got a breast swim, a long life.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special recommendations, I would like to draw attention to the restrained attractiveness of trampolin.
Although trampoline has been a type of Olympics since 2000, when it performed its first performance in Sydney's races, its presence has been observed in the past 16 years so little that many of the interviews I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic type at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal, and its athlete has not progressed to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan are defending their gold medals in London.
However, trampolin is associated with the charm of a certain subcontractor, partly because it sounds more appropriate to clown school than to Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an airless fan.
The species have opportunities for amusement, as seen in the colour of the endless bounces of drawing filters, but it also has the congestion of the gym and swim jump, two species that are in principle connected to it.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means a deployment board.
The championship seekers jump up to almost 30 feet [30 feet] with a giant trampoline, and they must perform twisting business series (kääns, skills and voltages) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
There are 32 athletes in Rio in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympics direction is straight ahead.
Medals of hope must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes backwards around the field.
They are not just hunting for the goal line or for the start, but also, in television news, another lunatic limit: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatic, and it can even get a viewer to tears.
But that is also why watching the races can be a little exhausting.
Trampolin offers a rest for this.
Trampolin's headed up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises up to a new rise with a weightless effect astronaut, goes up, then down, then suddenly up again.
Of course, this does not involve competition or difficulties, but during the programme there is no rageful ambush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, just a dream of time and gravity, a dreamy, melting interruption.
It's as close to the zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's carnival competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at the start of the shipment at 13.00 (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 13.00.
NBC sends the finals as part of his afternoon software from 14 a.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic Drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared and artificial (such as US male forcers suggested some time ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his slight new fans.
"The generation shows his mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term ally in the United States.
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced the government's violent opposition.
The eyewitnesses say that tens of demonstrators have been shot to death in confrontations with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
During the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African states, a western strong alliance, whose economy is rapidly growing.
In recent months, demonstrations against the government have, however, strangled the country when spreading to more and more regions.
One of the thousands of people in the last week roamed on the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to the human rights groups, the government's response was unsatisfactory.
The eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The widespread videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security authorities hit young people with kettle while forced them to stand against the wall.
The United Nations Principal Court of Human Rights is now calling for an in-house investigation.
"To keep this country together was always difficult, and it will continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the African sarve in the International Crisis Group study group.
Ethiopia is the second most crowded country in Africa after Nigeria, and western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in combating terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the Western countries.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital in Addis Abeba is even a new train for workers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken about the repression of the government, the opposition of the country has been limited and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no other choice than to show their minds, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows his mind.
One generation shows his mind.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything in the coalition of land use in the squeeze of the power of the coalition.
After the greatly criticised elections last year, the party and its allies, which were ruling, received the last place that was held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats of this Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the cross border of Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
The analysts are afraid that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been more or less defeated over the past few years, can try to take advantage of and re-arrange themselves.
Numerous factors explain why bitter emotions are now exploding after years of death.
The first seems to be insecure: smartphones.
Only over the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media when cheaper smartphones have become widespread and Internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through remote network servers to hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhara, are better able to cope with each other.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the ambhares, mostly from the Christian superstitions of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business by using oroms, many of whom are Muslims and are living in the suburbs.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way to organize under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, Director of Oromo.
The main demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo.
Many ambhares and oroms think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigre people. The people cover about six percent of the population and dominate the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the restlessness is Meles Zenaw's loss.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died in a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw him around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to detect early signs of displeasure and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
"There is no fundamental instinct like this", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up as relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say that the security services controlled by the Tigres do not trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bleeding.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in possession of such a wreck in 2005, when thousands showed their view of the elections that, according to analysts, appeared that the government first staggered and then robbed them.
In the following intensive attack, many demonstrators died, although less than in the last few months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for the ideal infrastructure planning, such as the new road train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not stopped the intensification of the internal government of Ethiopia.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and the anger against Tigre becomes increasingly common in social media.
The analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and the other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights in the neighbouring country in Somalia, although it said a while ago that it closed this base.
Although western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want the instability of their allies in the region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "There is real balance."
Donald Trump explains his Obama base-Isisin statements as "Carcasms"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign with a controversy on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he this week insisted on many occasions that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic state.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American general.
It also set his defenders, who have pushed to defend him during a stormful period, into a difficult position where they have to explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After the suggestion made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump claimed the same more and more enthusiastic on Thursday interviews, where he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation from the previous day when Trump said that in several interviews he was really serious about the accusation.
When the Conservative Radio Runner Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trum to draw his attention by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism will come in a situation where Trump has re-entered its campaign in the midst of the results of the opinion study.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned again that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech would be boring.
Trump has used sarcasm protection before.
Later in July, after he encountered a broad criticism apparently when he proposed that the Russians should hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course I am sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return, if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important for his fans. He sees how they work and then "explanes" direction or direction depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language use of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever about his statements and knows that they are sufficiently vague to allow them to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of alleviating his speeches for a large general vote, Trump has been more sane in the last few days when his popularity has continued to count.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is prominently scattered after Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is rigid in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid apologies about provoking matters, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
While he encountered a closer look at the presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal ally to the uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, regardless of how provoking his comments are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump's most important supporters, was very much in the effort to defend the candidate at the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real, political comments," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the Trump's argument on the reality, according to which Obama and Clinton set up the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the Republicans in the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to handle the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack on the news media, which will flourish his every word and are impartial against him.
He mocked the "human, pathetic" television experts who try to make him clear, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he was inappropriate to be president.
Previously on The Closed Cafe Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a stubborn, only a cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street of Bedford Avenue cost it too much.
The business that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The most recent loss in the city of central renegade was the locals.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reconvention.
The elevated Verb opened up to Greenpoint last November, less than a mile away from its original location.
There's a wifi in the new Verb and you can pay for credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there's the same unfinished atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee in the old cafe, who is the owner of the new place and the director.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espressone.
It even used old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon egg sandwiches on the menu, and there are caprices and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the cafeteria, but there's fresh juice.
During the nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed a uniform flow of old stock customers.
"Williamsburg also cost too many former customers," he said.
One of the last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visit Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafeteria.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up for a while from the coffee drink.
"I understand that I enjoy Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, even though that day he ordered a confused chai beverage instead of his usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before he worked and always made the same order.
"Every day more than fifteen, regular as the watch, I went in, and they were making spices with my bagel butter," he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making its usual orders, but sometimes because of variation, he is ordered with spicy bagel bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear anger for a soap store that took over old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verb a special soap that would be used as a component for cold extracted coffee in the cafe.
"I think we can still take the offer," said Rodriguez.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into half, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up soon to something to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other interests.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe is expanding to the next building.
For many customers, they get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a stock client and said it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: disruptive food
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to eat lunch in his office room.
The delicious direction president Roosevelt liked the fine-tuned food of Fifth Avenue, such as the glove butterfly, and Maryland's turtle cooking.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in the tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from plumbing.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights is a history of food.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life on the Lower East Siden floor house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their newest cooperation, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the 1930s in the great recession period.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet a supplier at dinner in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unsweeted lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been operating since the 1929 stock exchange attack.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meatcake, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the recession.
"The murmurs were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There were peanuts, liver chips, peanuts.
They were made of the manufacturing material and of some cheap ingredient that continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe's creepy.
"It must have felt like a heavy lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years prior to the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eat-nine-palk-like-jaxat-nouto table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. The Square Meal book crowned the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer the land of abundance.
Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One agitating was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as nutritious foods and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use food stars", mentioned Ziegelma, because the cocktails were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Muscle, which had been at the centre of American meals for years, became a luxurious product that was stored.
Special compositions were experimented with calories and nutrient concentrations more important than taste or even a healthy sense in the kitchen.
For the purpose of the study, Ziegelma also prepared a season of food in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the fried onions.
This was characteristic of many recipes of households.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, were more than ever directed by the country’s food practices before or after.
The recipes and articles of publications in newspapers and magazines they encouraged women to start "budjets" and to respond to the challenge of transforming the muffled spaghetti and carrots to tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is a historic taste party.
Particularly tasty are reports of government responses to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, allow me to eat your cake gun.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood with simple, iowa farm food, he ate like a refined millionaire he had become.
"He liked the continental food, like the fish with the cucumber sauce," Coe said.
She ate a tuxedo on her in a nearly golden dining room.
He was the greatest outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered to be one of Washington's most naughty, but also to the worst-made food."
Many of the displaced meals were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote a book, they gained a better understanding of how Ziegelman’s mother was eating, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even made people sick."
There was an intersection.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe took out the dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumprint food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Plum wool," Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give a seeming name to the modest receptors.
There was no cream wax, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cannabis.
Everyone unwillingly suffocated their spoons into a sticky, brown liquor.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe danced once and another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A little chopped German peanuts could help."
Gilead will be replaced by legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent struggle against Merck
The U.S. Marriage Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive legal expenses incurred in a dispute against Merck & Co Inc in the case of hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was exempted from the 200 million dollars of payments by breaking two Merck patents associated with Gilead’s prosperity medicine, Sovald and Harvon. This release resulted in the finding of the American judge in Merck’s abuses, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman, the United States of America, said that Gilead is entitled to waive the compensation that was incurred in opposition to the claim.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, which controls the market in the new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case will take place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged one another to the right of the active substance of Gilead medicines from the sofosbuvir-based laboratory work.
The troops supported by the United States say that they have completely conquered Manbij by Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have completely reigned near the northern town of Manbij, Turkey, after the last remaining Isis fighters left town, said the group representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had released more than 2,000 wings of captives, who were considered prisoners by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwish SDF's federal force, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully controlled, but we have started studying it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration in 2015, which showed that the incomes of the candidate of the President of the Democrats and his spouse were USD 10.75 million in that year and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly to Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million of paybacks, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in a booklet telling him about his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10 years of tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a measure of economic transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign assistant.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to this, the US presidential candidates are publishing their tax declarations, even though they are not required by the law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the audit of the tax administration for the refusal to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," said Ian Sams, Clinton's campaign assistant, on Twitter, publishing a link to the tax declarations of the candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's specialist Michael Cohen told CNN he wouldn't allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trumpi's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and many other links, for example, to Russia.
Clinton has taken the problem on Friday of the published online video that brought out visible Republicans who urge Trum to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate of the last decade has done: published his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business colonel borrowed on Friday numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the meeting of Clinton in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an ongoing control of the tax administration, and that Trump is not "scared" for the tax collector's office, but for voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, Clintons, in Chappaqua in New York, accounted for about 32% of the real federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's tax returns for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment site was a cheap investment fund, linked to the index, and Clinton announced dividend and interest income of USD 109 000.

Child powder condoms and spices enhance the protection of Tanzania’s elephant
Natural Protectors in Tanzania are using an unusual way to prevent elephants from traveling to human habitats, throwing animals with chili powder filled condoms.
The project has proved effective, and several years ago the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has developed its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of North Denmark to use an inviolable four-step way of protecting homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
Earlier, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed tools, we have found a change in attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident about keeping elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Managing Director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include the intruding elephant with a flashlight and the ringing of the storm.
If it doesn't stop the animal, they'll throw the so-called "chilipilv".
The condom is filled with chili powder and soil mix, and then circulating the condom so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts and explodes chili powder dust in the air.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in another direction.
The last way to do this is the trigger that blows up a Roman candle, and the fire fire produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: The Jewish filmmaker criticizes the Berlin hotel that deleted Israel’s direction number at the request of the Arabs
The French, Jewish filmmaker, released a media storm after exposing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's direction number.
Claude Lanzmann, the Shoah documentary of Holocaust, purged his frustration in the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent night stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country reference number in the list offered by the hotel in Israel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016, Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
When he was looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took it up at the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that came from it was "annoying him."
The hotel's reseptionist said that it was a considered decision on the management of the Kempinski hotels.
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking in the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli direction number," says the employee said according to Lanzmann.
The German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel calls the case "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It's already in itself a big misdemeanor.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused quite a response online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "refunded" to the claimed demands of the Arabians.
"Fuck," was said in another publication, which pointed out that a great hotel on the Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself disputed all the charges quickly and called what happened as "inaccurate" and "forgive me" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"A clear command to not include Israel in the fast selection list has never been included," says the representative of Kempinski, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
The police used tears and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating their minds
On Thursday, students met with the police in the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil, when the students met to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tears and rubber bullets against demonstrators.
The problems began when law overseers tried to dismantle the student force, leading to the police using rubber bullets and tears.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror of plans.
According to Mr Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reassigned to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against the temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after the demonstrators took off as a single force to support the detention of President Dilma Rousseff when the senate of the country voted for his prosecution.
RT trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly growing by 71%
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were removed, the Russian companies have shown great interest in their transactions in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"One of the most important objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover in trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5% in total USD 697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran rose by 16% to USD 158 million.
"The growth of the market was achieved by delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Furthermore, Dzhagarya expects this year a record of Iranian tourists to Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted some 35 000 visas to Iran’s citizens mainly to travel.
Iran was also the first time among the 20 countries, the most tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record of Iranian crosses in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotter Callum Skinner smashed into the paint when the British caught a bike gold
Scotland Callum Skinner would be honored at the men's teamprint on Rio's bike stadium last night when the third of the British team defended his championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague, Sir Chris Roy, rehabilitated, the legend was proud of the young man, when he was struggling to the goal by catching the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic Games.
And they repeated the trick once they were modestly placed in the 6th March World Championships in London, even though Hoy has then decided to compete.
The problem between Beijing and London's races was the replacement of special embassy Jamie Staff.
This could be accomplished just in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's end also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which British coachs held up in view of the Scottish potential that is now a tattoo.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead on the first round.
And the British triangle won a double fight for gold.
After his round, Hindes was very short, but Kenny hit the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategic change was a big part of the change in shape, and it included Hindes' driving on a larger gear, so that he could slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped into the award.
23-year-old Glasgowlainen Skinner said, "The spin is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and to get a reputation.
At the final, we made an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after the bad start.
He later withdraws his comments, and British competitors have not complained.
This time there was no similar problem in the case of overwhelming profits.
Hindes said, "It felt like he was in London when there were so many tickets to Great Britain."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven of the ten cycling species in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be expected to have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's decentness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's charity, winning three Olympic golds in the Olympics.
That would mean that Kennyn, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also born on 23 March (this apparently sacred day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It'd be like Hoy's.
Kenny's gonna compete in a sprint that starts today and takes three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I've only enjoyed one of these.
The team race is always the best.
It's gonna be won together with the friends.
To win alone is, honestly, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doulll were the fastest four-mile teams in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be at the heart of the attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the timeliness, when the officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the corresponding women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in the world recording time at the time of 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great roaming team will take over the midst of the Olympics and achieve a whole set of medals.
After presenting a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio races.
There has been a drama on the background, which has not been the lowest in the difference between the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexual and temptation charges, as well as the end of the career of major people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night competitions in the cycling stadium, however, it appears that the legendary reputation of Britain now rises at the perfect moment of its peak could be true again.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria’s Aluminium Solid, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the owners of the factory is deciding on the distribution contract, so there is a possible operation of all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government that the aid required for the operation of the factory will not be continued.
The subsidy period for the 20-year period shall expire in November.
Even 2,000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2,000 jobs may be at risk, either directly or indirectly, due to the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the melting is used by about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltless, which last year led to the closure of the Anglese power plant.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown loses money and is under the shutdown.
The measure is now following a number of years of speculation from the future of the factory, which began with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production of the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy in Latrobe Valley from his power plant, Loy Yang An, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their contracts.
Most of the factory owns Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland factory to continue, which means that the physical need for unsweetened electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called 'defence agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the year 2017", said the electricity company.
All potential impacts on the AGL from 2018 onwards are currently limited to the strong outlook of the Flow Market for electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by 187 million dollars by "foreseeing termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "not affecting Alcoa ... the ability to keep melting or to secure unblended electricity."
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it had withdrawn from the agreement.
The analysts have been vigilant, both in Victoria, and also in view of the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Previously on the week Stephen Mikkelsen, Managing Director of the AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and about 900 megawatts of Tomago.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for the [electricity] market.
As a electricity producer to us, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true TV star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of the Vogue in September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter is on the cover of the US Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and modeled in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, reported the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"With this deck in a room full of loved ones, it made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover publication followed a unique (or perhaps just the Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except the Troubles Rob and Caitlyn, and with all the favorite entertainment, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about his sister’s cover, but which ended up in a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché design of almost every child TV series (Seacrest says the shift words "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning bunny), but Kris had to get other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new era of the Kardashians with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall’s sister Kim may have reached Vogue’s action first (in fact divided her husband with Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite its own.
Vogue's September number is the most selling edition throughout the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee protocol than the fashion paper, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion reduced that last year's 832-page guide 615 was advertising content).
It is expected to reveal its cover for so intensely that for the last two years, the images of the newspaper have bleed before the official release.
Previously on the cover were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publicities that act as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar's winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on board in 2013, after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, whose magazine describes his generation as a "movement model", hits the first category, he's in a pretty good association.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or modern youths who can make a good Snapchat video (but Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce's cover model last year has had one of the strongest years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
His real-screen history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a thunder.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "this moment of bitch."
This feeling came up again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But unsatisfactory spinning is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue number of September.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of himself in their apps found behind the paywall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the Love magazine.
And in his free time, perhaps just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a real-TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away annually
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are withdrawn from the Community legal centres annually when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financial cuts on its activities at extreme borders.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mostly old people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair evicts and similars - are already turned away when they seek to express legal advice and representation.
The legal services that have already been dragged to the extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funding.
Mr James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will just get worse.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away annually from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and inflexible debts, families in different residences, unjustly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected residents in Queensland are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on both the Minister of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis to immediately withdraw these financial operations so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the State Government made its promise to raise the funding of legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to examine the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign was challenged after the employee was alleged to have a threatened weapon.
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was challenged to the court that they were allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina threatened the employee in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the case filed by Vincent Bordin, the former programme practitioner of the state campaign, in Charlotte, on Wednesday at the State Court.
Bordini said he was waiting for months to handle the situation internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "he put out a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed a pipe against Vincent's knee lime," Bordini said in the action.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had experienced similar experiences with Phillip, it was said in the action.
"There is no need to launch the weapons to cause damage," said Bordini in the action.
The challenge will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused an anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the second addition of people" - which is generally understood by the owners of weapons and armed persons - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was elected and could be chosen by judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has removed his word from the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
Bordin's challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for negligible control, and for Phillip's violence, assault and emotional shock.
Hope Hicks, Mr Trump's representative, did not answer the request for comments immediately.
They couldn't reach Phillip.
WCCB, a local newsgirlfriend in Charlote, reports Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call for calls submitted to the Innovation Consulting Services was not answered immediately by his consultant.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
British must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow brings recovery and flowering into the whole stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For myself, this was a great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was the attraction of the London 2012 races, when we faced a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions benefited from the races.
The Olympics made huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we will do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs are created only for local communities, and youth unemployment is removed from the airport.
Just as before the 2012 competitions in London, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the races and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always barriers to crossing, but Heathrow will answer every question that will be asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not only for a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and GBP 211 billion economic growth, as well as to leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has carried out a 11 billion GBP infrastructure investment programme in time and budget staying: T5, which has been voted as the world's best airport terminal in five years in a row, T2, which was built between the world's two most urgent runways.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, which supports GBP 16 billion of private money.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that it is also the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse game to prevent advertisements
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies overrun the program that prevents advertising is a "cat and mouse game", one of the companies producing this programme said.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog paper that said that users could update the program filters to prevent advertising on social network websites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code is being changed from advertising to make it more difficult for advertising inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been circulating a new code.
In the blog book Adblock, Ben Williams wrote that "the battle of this kind of backback between the community that prevents the advertising of the open source code and its circumvents have been running since the prevention of advertising was discovered" and that it is possible that Facebook will find its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great tragedy of advertising inhibitors become industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reports last year in Pagefair and Adobe. This is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile appliances, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the advertising inhibitors of the websites used on the computer, as the mobile advertising inhibitors do not operate in Facebook's mobile applications to the social network or to Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising continues to bring enough income to make Facebook feel worth investing in this kind of activity.
On Tuesday, too, Facebook said that it would give people more power on how to target advertising to them.
On Thursday, Facebook argued that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the site from content other than advertising.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," said Facebook's representative in the e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have focused instead on building tools such as Ad Preferences that provide control to people.
She was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman stayed on the motorway under several vehicles on Thursday in the early hours of the case that apparently was suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges at Vaudi Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "unconscious act" and stood in the dark to lie on the road where she was hit by several means of transport, and Vaudi's police said in the statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a woman 49-year-old Swiss who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene of the event.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but not all have been identified, told the police who appealed them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
The crime investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"However, let's see if any of the involved drivers are being prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
It's the prosecutor's problem," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, where there was a person walking in a dark motorway, it was estimated that the drivers could not wait to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the magazine said.
Last year, the police were released from prosecution of negligence after he hit and killed a man lying near Paynerne on the A! road one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking, and had passed out on the road, and the court was told.
The Court noted that the police, who were responding to an emergency call, had a reasoned time, and that the man’s presence on the road was "the situation is absolutely exceptional and unpredictable", the judge said.
Everyone who has information on Thursday's case near Morges should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had once to live
According to the NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely once to live.
Researchers at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to the use of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the waterless surfaces of Venus, and the completion of CO2 with air development could sometimes be ground-like conditions.
Scientists have previously expressed that Venus’ slow rotation rate explains its thick atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus could have been thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have spinned slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have drier areas on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to allow life and to protect water from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus was also the advantage of a 30 percent creepyer sun.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its day-to-day sun for almost two months at a time, Anthony Del Genio, researcher of GISS, explained in the newsletter.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that works as a umbrella shielding the surface of a large part of the sun heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the present Earth.
The model produced a story from the stages of the development of Venus, which is similar to what planetary researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabitable sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick CO2 atmosphere left with a deadly greenhouse gas phenomenon - the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up the worker's cleaning for the Avalanche Coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the Deputy Director-General for Hockey Affairs and Colorado Avalanche, namely the reason for the lack of influence in the decision-making process.
The Deputy Director-General of Colorado/Chairman Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have made my duty as the vice-head of hockey matters in Colorado Avalanche and as the chief coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination", Roy, 50 years old, said in the opinion.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vice-president of the coach and hockey affairs should be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was appointed to receive the Jack Adams Award for the best coach of the league during the first Avalanchen period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the victory of the central division, but Minnesota fell on the first round of Colorado's playoffs, and the team has not been able to proceed over the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the period 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 defeats and 4 slots, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card playground in the West Conference.
The goalkeeper of the Hall of Fame won four Stanley Cupis - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue negotiations and delay strike
When all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said that the work of the Oil workers in the North Sea will be postponed.
Laws against the Wood Group are occasionally organised by the North Sea drilling boilers led by the Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Units and RMTs, can confirm that we have agreed to reopening the process to resolve the current dispute", read in the joint opinion.
During the next few weeks, we will keep several whole-day meetings early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent workshop, which they say to be the first for more than 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut the premiums of the North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's premium reduction follows a 10% reduction in its contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional operations would give the company the necessary space to cope with the downturn of the market.
On the other hand, Shell has reduced thousands of people from their salary list and has announced their plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its activities as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is worsening by the decision of the United Kingdom of June to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish MEP, met the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest working disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need a economy that works for many, not only for few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejadian Star Team
The last task of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most perfect list of the speeds of the stars of the Plejadian stars.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the star force rotate at variable speeds, and how the circular times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even the history of the solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre, the Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis.
The starship of the Plejades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at top level now.
At its peak wheeling speed, these grown-up stars are stretching large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of the identifiable stars, such as sunlights.
The last list of the stars' rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, from which the bigger ones make pie more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejadian starship is so close, it is ideal for the cosmic laboratory to assess the characteristics of stars at rotation speeds.
Rebull said, "The group of stars offers an anchor to the theoretical models of the anchor, which cover both directions, younger and older."
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow their speed and so-called hang their dancing shoes.
Rebull and his colleagues described the latest analysis of Plejadi speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
