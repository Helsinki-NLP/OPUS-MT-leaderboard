I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I remembered her duty.
I respect Tomi.
I'll retire in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
I want you to iron these shirts first.
I'm running faster than you.
I run eight kilometers a day.
I'm running.
I've picked up the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna work.
I said no.
I thanked you.
I sat and stared.
I sat next to him.

I served with Tom at the special forces.
I've got the table for six people.

I've shaken my head.
I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been more summarised.
I should have been more accurate.
I should have been more thorough.
I should have been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should have done that last week.

I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have refused to do that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have counted on that.
I should have followed your advice.
I should've said I'm busy.
I'm yelling, but no one can hear you.
I just want to know what this is about.

Is this dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to speak an esperant?

Is it true that Tom killed himself?
Is it true that you learned an esperant in a week?
Is it true that you put me on Tomi's request?
Is it true you like salt coffee?

I'm skiing in winter, swimming in summer.
Laurie's dungeon?
I sleep with two pillows.
After midnight, I spent an hour sleeping last night.
I fell asleep, I'm late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I thanked my boss.
I've cleared the turkey.
Mary Tom's mother?
I'm smoking cigarettes.
How's Monday?
Do you understand me?
I clicked a picture.
I sneaked into the house.
I ran into the house.
I snitched it.
Do you mind?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that a gastrointestinal?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
How far is Paris?
I'll speak Dutch a little bit.
I speak a little Hungarian.

I've been with them all day.
I spent all my money.

I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I've been wandering for an hour until I figured out where to go.
I spent the beginning of my life in an incubator.
I spent the beginning of my life in an incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day barking in front of my plane.

Is Sicily very close to Malta?
I've been staring at papers all day, and now I'm tired.
I started doubting about your claim.
I stayed.
Is tea more expensive than milk?
Are you authorized?
Is this all your change?
It's a secret?
Is that right?
Is that deliberate?
Is that beer in the picture or is it photographed?
Is that beer on the picture or on it?
Is this my mug?
Is this booked in a public document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Is there a scientific basis for this?
Did you expect something like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?

I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
It's been seven or eight years.
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one or two more things left to put in the suitcase.
I have to have some more breakfast.
I still think it's the best choice.
Tom Christian?
Is Tom well cooked?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?

Tamás is still sick?
I've got it.
I stopped by to see you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I'm studying about two hours every day.
I'm studying busy in school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've already packed up, and you're ready to go.
I'm sure I heard that voice somewhere.
I swear to God, I'm gonna make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we get over it.
I'm taking his place.
I work with a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's all up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It involves the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It could be a problem.
You must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work done.
I'm clearly freaked out.
It didn't break.
I wasn't sick.
It didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
It's cool to let you come.
He's not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I found out I misunderstood him.
It's been a day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That's exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be some reason to do this.
It happened suddenly.
That's what happened when she was out there.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I've got your own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should die.
I think everybody's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you're gonna be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's been a couple of cinematographic cubes out.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think we have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It was like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better this way.
I think it's right.
It's a very low probability, I think you're going to be able to do that yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think that's right.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think you'd better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you're gonna be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find the spiders cute.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point trying to convince him.
I think they've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tomi's exciting.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all clamoring now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tamás's girlfriend's name is.
I think you're going to approve it.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in private.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your work is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't very persuasive.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with her.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was going to explode.
I've reconsidered my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under control.
I was very impressed.
It's accidental!
It's a historic scene.
It's hard to put it into practice that we were talking about.
It's hard for everyone to think about.
It's hard for everyone.
I have doubts about whether it's going to work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in all possible ways.
Actually, it's your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke signal cannot be turned off.
It's not the best way to do this.
It's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 18th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It doesn't work.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not right to talk full of mouth.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's a really bad time today.
Goddamn it!
Thirty-six feet long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's on you.
It's useful information.
There's a lot of heat in the night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark before we get home.
It'll be ready for when.
He'll be ready for when he needs to.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It will work if I replace polarities.
As a result, it seems bigger.
Looks good.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
We need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
I'm sure they stole it.
It's got to be fixed.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
Even though I lied to him, I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like it, Tomi.
I have a question for you.
I was bathing for a long time.
I've been in the bath for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I'm on the 58th road.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
Last morning, the rain broke.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining.
I train two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I traveled to the United States cross and cross.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big bunny cat.
It's a little early for the drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, paper at least.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a housekeeper.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen late.
It's all dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's a nice and good theory, but will this work?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's 10 o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same thing.
Environmental disaster.
This is a ugly business, Watson, a ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
That's a big, big, big, big babble.
It's a terrible news.
It's ice cold.
It's just as art as science.
That's the past.
He's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This day is exhausting.
It's a tough day.
It happened before.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since you left me.
That's better.
It's a better night to sniff the garden.
Fire hot.
Goodbye.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
It's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's known that the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's totally normal.
Now it's okay.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's delicious.
It's ready!
It's even easier to start than to stop.
It's easy from far away to be brave.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
It seemed like the bus was late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like you're lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work out for me.
Looks like you're honest to me.
You seem wrong to me.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Darling.
It's fair to have the same salary for the same job.
It's not even perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's starting to become a fool.
We'll have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see the star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
I'm so glad you could come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to get to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe this whole time was clean and day-to-day.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town that can sleep on.
It's hard to put in words.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's very nice.
He's got a big head.
He's tall.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop making money!
It's hotter than usual tonight.
This is illegal.
This is important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when children are raised.
It's important to help people get in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to comply with your terms.
We don't know what tomorrow brings.
Unbelievable, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just an instinct.
Just step away.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
I'm glad you say that.
It's late.
It's a wash today.
It's like a submarine field, and turtles above them and sharks like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
Not as watchful as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This isn't gonna happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 18th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't show repentance.
It doesn't make any sense to be in the past.
It's snowing.
Obviously it's broken.
Obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
Obviously, it's very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
“ It took three months, and Tomi says that he speaks the French fluidly. ” — Yes, he is at the top of his stupid man. — What peak? — Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
It's the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring you out of bats.
She opened her wings.
It's quite amazing.
Quite convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of this mysantrope theory is to manifest itself in the evaluation of the class of work, relieving imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars he has provoked, and to believe in the core of the thought that the causes of infinite wars are the causes of man’s congenital aggressive tendencies.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a big number.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much he earns.
They say Czech girls are pretty.
They say they'll soon leave Tokyo.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
Boston's snowing now.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time we took our tent trees.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have cut my hair off.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time for us to do something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for this now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn time.
It sucks to get cold.
It's ugly, shaking yellow, and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't run away in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe not as stupid as you think.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you to go there or not.
It's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very fun.
It's a lot of money to live here.
That's very nice of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
A thorough learning of a language requires about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
He was all unexpected.
He took just an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a few shoes.
It took a long time, but finally we found it.
I went to a little alley.
I laped.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
That was a tragic accident.
It was a really great food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully strange.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
She was a loser.
Obviously, it was very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the time was tingling.
It was just a snatch.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of the seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy to keep my promise.
That was a swing under the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
