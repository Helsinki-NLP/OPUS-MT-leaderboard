In Estonia and Spain four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested
According to the mailman, the police in Spain held the so-called Kemerovo group leader in the Estonian world, Slava Gulevich, known as Slava Kemerovski, in a criminal world.
Gulevich arrested in Spain under the authority of the court.
Yesterday, three suspects arrested in Estonia were also arrested by the court.
It is doubtful that the so-called "Kemerovo criminal community" is a lifetime of 27-57 years, which is mainly committed to drug crimes.
In Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested in Mijas, Malaga province.
In Estonia, three men were suspected, one of which was collected according to the information collected by the leader of a criminal community and two were members of a criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles clearly shared in the criminal community were clearly shared.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal income," commented the prosecutor, Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude the increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
This has been the case with people who have previously had an interest in law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that a pre-examinement of nearly a year and a half had taken place before detention.
"In the first half of this area, long-term work was realised, and we held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officials were assisted in detention in Spain.
For many years, we have a good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and civilian cards.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecution requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure seizure.
The pre-trial proceedings are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Organisation Office and is run by the Public Prosecutor.
In 2005, Slava Gulevich was convicted by the Tallinn City Court for extortion and sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered a second man in the Estonian criminal world after the underworld leader in Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerov was raised in the Estonian world in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortions in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating in different hotels and demanded a monthly tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal income and the judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight in the field of organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accusants of the so-called Dikajev criminal offences, who were confiscated with a criminal income of EUR 80 000, or a judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov established in 2006 a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade in salary cigarettes and the execution of crimes relating to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruina and South Estonia.
The confiscated criminal income is around EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, progress has been made to ensure that police officers exchange information and evidence with external colleges every day and, if necessary, take action together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns you about traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned the black people traveling to Missouri against discrimination and racist attacks in the state.
The report of the group states: "The NAACP Passenger note issued for the state of Missour, which is valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly careful and extremely cautious, taking into account the suspicious events of the entire race, which have recently taken place throughout the State and have been highlighted here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missour law which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as by the fact that the targets of regularists of the state are inequalityly minorities.
"The citizens' rights are being violated.
They are pulled on the road because of their skin color, beaten or killed," said the president of the NAACP Missouri branch Rod Chapel to the newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so close complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults in the direction of black students at Missour University and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died half the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got gased through the state and Missouri's police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the observation refers to the recent report of the Chief Prosecutor of Missour, which shows that black drivers' cars are suspended in the State by 75% more probability than white-skin cars.
"Something is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues for what could happen in Missouris," said Chapel.
"People must be ready, whether this means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are passing through to the state."
Based on the latest data of the F.B.I. programme on information on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which place the number of violations similar to the state in the 16th section of the country.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to appeal to the company's court for housing or work in search of discrimination.
The United States of America’s Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after the adoption of the Immigration Acts which oblige the local ability to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said this increases the racial profile.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides warnings about other countries, but recently, stakeholders have started to use this measure as a response to certain domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could everyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver corticus and cancer.
Epidemiology consultant Kuulo Kuzar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are similar for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray faeces, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.
The last symptoms of liver inflammation also originate from the national name of yellow disease.
Paediatric patients may experience hepatitis without signs of disease.
Various types of hepatic inflammation can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can go over to chronic hepatitis for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-injurious disease.
Kuulo Kusar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
A hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating or drinking water, by drinking water, by having sex, from the faeces of the infected person to food, surfaces, objects, in the mouth, and from the use of drugs.
The family members and caregivers of patients with chronic liver disease, people with infectious sex, men sexing with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting high-speed hepatitis countries.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people with a large number of travellers and a hepatitis risk group.
In addition, it is important that the daily sanitation requirements be fulfilled: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before taking food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spreading in patients with human blood exposure, injecting drugs, tattooing, acceleration, use of blood contaminated living grains (hams, shavings), donor blood, sex with a hepatitis susceptible person, and hepatitis-infected mother to foetus/resynthesis.
B The risk group of hepatitis infection includes injecting drugs, infected human sex partners, males sexing with men, newborn mothers, sick family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting high-hepatitis countries.
B In order to prevent hepatitis it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group and in addition to those suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
B Other preventive measures for hepatitis include: avoidance of the use, tattooing and acceleration of foreign hygiene and manicure devices, other sharp tools and syringe needles, and the use of a condom in the event of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spreading in human blood contact, injecting drugs, tattooing, acceleration, use of contaminated olanzapine grains, donor blood, sex with a suspected person of hepatitis, and from a hepatitis-infected mother to a foetus/reversity.
The risk group of hepatitis C infection includes injecting drugs, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborn mothers, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers, HIV-infected persons, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis disease.
C Hepatitis prevention measures include: avoidance of the use of alien hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and syringe needles, tattooing and Augusting, and use of a condom in the event of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis causes hepatitis D virus, which is multiplied by hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D Hepatitis viruses spread from exposure to blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexual routes and rarely infected mothers to foetus.
D The risk group of hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people not immune to hepatitis B.
Effective prevention measures are vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D virus infection.
E hepatitis viruses spread by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-heated animal meat, fish and carcases, donor blood, jointly used syringes and infected mothers to foetus.
Travellers may infect E high-hepatitis in countries with disease.
E Hepatitis prevention measures are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after being in the bathroom, before cooking and eating, after being treated.
Fruits and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoiding the eating of hot-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drinking only safe drinking water and avoiding drug consumption.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to squeeze a four-fold Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won at 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling his wife, Tania and children along the track after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on their tracks was amazing," told Farah to journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title competition in London for a golden double of 5000 and 10 000 metres.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori "Daam in gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer's extraordinary portrait" is far deeper from the history of a work of art at the end of the 19th century and from the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna's culture.
But even more thoroughly, history.
The spectacular amount of information, the harder flea, the narrower theme, would have been used to allow more effect on the extraordinary story of the portrait.
At present, there would be two books between one cover: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in gold" described Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more volatile and wider history book of respectable Jewish families and German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the dazzling, and who entered the capital of Austria himself, it may be hard to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was in the Ringstra area or how all the heads were turned in in the Central Café when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural people was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see a known name in the book, you feel like a gram of culture.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the swamp was in an untreated syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if nothing was added to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, however, each pair-worded pinch also adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth Vienna resident was Jewish.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married himself twice to Ferdinand Bloch, the Czech sugar Magnate, and Klimt, for his famous paintings, his father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But the whole glamorous life that he belonged to was not drawn from Adele.
If you look at "Dama's gold", it's hard to believe that the end of your life, this great lady infected from socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The order of Klimt paid 4,000 kroons at that time, a quarter of the good location of the land house.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of a master's love story with a model did not throw sugar magnets.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist in the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in gold.
Gustav Klimt masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Baueri portrae extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, English-translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had been to the Basilica in Ravenna, San Vitale, and the researchers believe that the glorious mosaics of the Emperor Theodora just there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait in Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dama's gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (in the years 1907-1908), another golden land "Course".
The similarity of two women was not ignored by artistic historians.
What about Hitler?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt I owe him to make his handwork available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished their family Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before the death, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
In his will, too (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt’s landscape to the Austrian gallery.
She inherited her jewelry to her niece Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to reach the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, Adolf Hitler, a 17-year-old, but failed to draw.
Although, sometimes Hitler’s later antisemitism is considered to be the reason why the Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examers were actually Jewish.
However, the Austrian Galerii, mentioned in the will, had become a significant task by 1939, which had become important to the Nazi parties in Vienna’s rich Jewish art collections.
Hitler’s personal art property was also suited by some of the work that had been at Adele’s home, but not the Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year trial between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
It should be noted here that if the "Greatness" is seen in the Belvedere castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer in the "Dama's gold" must be visited in the New York Neue Gallery.
And before you go to Vienna, you will also read the above book.
Even if you don't want to go to Klimt's work because at least my emotions were spinning after the book closed more Nazi and Jewish themes than $ 135 million sold for painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
So not as much a portrait as a family story of fate - and a very touching story.
Bauer’s family tree at the beginning of the book was markedly facilitating the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m backslifting, swimming at 2.16.62.
The Tippmark comes from the 17-year-old glimpse of a week ago when the Canadian junior championships had a time of 2.16.58, the Priit mediates the Aavik Swimming Blog.
Gold got into the A-final on the last tenth, maybe.
In the final, he passed the distance at 2.15.76 and achieved a great seventh place with a new powerful peak.
From the Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2.15.13), Gold remained separated for a little more than half a second.
In the Estonian table of all times, Gold was third, and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting at the Canadian adult championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freelance and 200 m and 400 m complexity.
Last week, Toronto took place at the junior Championships in Canada, and Gold also made successful launches there.
He won 200 metres in a free-time silver medal with 2.03.22.
This was the last time the Estonian distant was floated so quickly in 2008.
The only Estonian recordinaine Elina Partõka has swimn this distant in Estonia faster than gold.
The Estonian resident in Canada won the pronksmedali 100 m freely with an excellent personal record and the top brand of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, the year-old Kertu Ly Alnek has swimn this distance by only one century.
He arrived at the top of the personal record in the opening of the time of the twisting in the time of 100 metres when he was floating.
At half a long distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swims at the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently in charge of the Estonian season's progress table on four different distances.
President Trump's on vacation, critics sharpening teeth.
It's time for holidays - that means relaxation to the President of the United States Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took out the most holidays, the critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president is planning to spend a 17-day vacation at a so-called golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's vacation began yesterday, the opponents of Trumpi have already spoken on vacation for a week.
They're throwing too frequent rest for Trump.
In particular, the president has the habit of spending weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump isn't in his 196 days of office the rest of the president.
For example, George W. Bush was able to leave for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after the president came to say "60 minutes", Trump said that no time will be left for long holidays during his trader, because very much is necessary to do.
He also made Barack Obama’s leave three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, plays golf, gos on parties and juzz concerts, ISIS cuts up the heads of journalists."
According to the White House officials, the 17-day visit to the golf club is not quite a relaxation.
It is officially called a job leave where Trump does not have time for reading or other entertainment.
In addition, leave had to have another reason.
In the western area of the White House, the conditioning system is replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
Ovaalkabine and other offices of the President are also located in the west wing.
"I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the west of August if there were 38 degrees and no conditioner," said the White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the President would continue working during vacation.
From where President Trump's next 17 days, you'll get a clue on the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the State Agency if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew a few things about the unfavourable media invention.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to squeeze him for everything from internal policy to political principles.
Critics, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't force his critics to silence.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Free freedom can be taken away from us and we can be led to slaughter by sheep when we are dark and quiet."
This brings me to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts of people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU appealed to the court.
The Governor's officials stamped the action to nothing and the web communications of the anti-responsive style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is amazingly popular Republic governor in a democratic state.
His percentage of discharge is the second priority of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan isn't an unthinkable responsive pussy.
He has led the state with certain hands and remained firmly determined to his principles.
In addition, he has used it as a key tool to communicate with his electorates quite vividly with Facebook, showing, for example, for the first time following chemistry treatment, his bald head.
Thus, the Governor’s paper is a public forum with official labels, which is managed by taxpayers’ salaries of dollars by blocking people who visit and ultimately dangerous.
Amelia Chasse, the Hogan Press Officer, defended the conduct of the Governor in the interview to The Washington Post, claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing but moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of web-linking online roles, spatters, or anger full of people.
The Post had a conversation with a number of real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet roles.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and none of them.
In his post, the priest quoted the Bible by pressing Hogan’s Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not inspire anger, but actually anger crimes.
"I was politely compromising that I was disappointed because he has not responded to anger crimes or any other recent news," he wrote in the The Post news story comment heading.
"I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject, some call it no matter what, as a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the Governor's official called "directed spam attack" would probably call others "open support".
The Facebook Time allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than the old days when workers had to be sent out to collect and burn or arrest the Protestants and make them silence.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for decaying Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trumpi has sued Twitter users who are blocked from the Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments on this matter, which were marked in Virginia last week.
In the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacher, Alexandria, the president of the Loudouni County Supervisory Board infringed the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the electorate from his Facebook page.
After using ACLU Facebook and Twitter, Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect than Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers squeezed his way of control.
And even then, Washington had to put the breast with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions down.
According to historic documents gathered in the context of George Washington's collection of messages, he buryed the office under petitions which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to silence.
Freedom of speech, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes at the Renaissance Club for the comfort of home territory
Former European premier Ronan Rafferty will hope for the comfort of the home territory within the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open will take place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irish, who was leading the last round of Archerfield Links in the neighborhood last year before Paul Eales was given rise, is fond of the new scene and performs the role of a tournament ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and executive director of the club.
"I saw the building of the Renaissance Club, and now we see the club sparking with this event in full glory," said Rafferty.
"Makers see the track in their best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what he's accomplished here.
It allows you to present the track excellently."
English Eales is looking forward to protecting the championship for the first time, although he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said a pedestrian player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off my winning calendar a year later.
It's magic to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember memories last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in the heart."
On the surface of the home country, Gary Orr will return to the competition, who joined the Senior Tour in Europe when he got 50.
It is his first event in Scotland after Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"In the home play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel an extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've shown a fairly decent golf game.
I'm pleased with the way things are going so far."
The former Masters tournament winner, Ian Woosnam, and the Senior Tour champions, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, join Trio.
Orphan and former Ryder's cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race light, the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and car parking pays 10 pounds for a car with one passenger and two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s golden grassland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he won't use a stick.
He even rarely uses the pot.
In the building of the wooden house in Enarota, the Indonesian retarded Papua province, in the Panian regent, places the homemaker directly to the firehouse, in local language nota.
After half an hour, the coaled mug is taken from the light and stabbed with unwashed hands with an enthusiastic skin.
Degei is sitting on a mud floor, he has no furniture, and there he also does his daily household work, for example, washs the cloudy water from the closest sex of laundry.
The role of the cellar is performed by the spider in the roofless room.
Since he is the youngest of four women in his husband, he has not been appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamia is normal here.
But late work can be dangerous for most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit me after 5:00 a.m.," he says.
This is a rare glimpse to life in the mountain of Papua. It is the former Dutch colony, which was combined in Indonesia in 1969 after the controversy caused a referendum that forced only 1026 old men to vote under the eyes of the occupant troops.
The movement of the Dutch people's supremacy in the direction of their wrath quickly against the Government of Jakarta, which is still under strong control of the region by keeping out of foreign journalists and human rights guards.
In 2003, the province was officially allocated to Papua and Western Papua, so that the eastern part of the island was left to the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is an equally remote and abandoned place. In order to reach this area, you have to fly 90 minutes from the capital of Jayapura to Nabre and then go through a five-hour journey to get sick with the rental car.
There's no public transport.
The city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tars and covered with wavelated iron roofs, with rusts transformed into yellow browns of different tones.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuad of Mee Pago worshiped God called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to our paint-sleeve handwritten turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Event we only wore it on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and literacy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a golden land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountain province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is located in the world's largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, which belongs to the company of Freeport McMoran in Phoenix.
Only in 2015, Freeport mined around USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be boasted with consumer tree stocks estimated to be worth 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of paputa suffering because they result in the suppressive presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
The Study of The New York Times 2005 showed that Freeport paid between 1998 and 2004 to local military and military units $20 million, including $150,000 for one officer.
The paputas’ efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden sharks and they are being ruthlessly surrounded.
According to human rights activists, more than 50,000 paputas have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian military forces.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of genocide in the mountainlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s was measured.
Last year alone, more than 3900 peaceful protestors were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the Birsbane Archbishop, "We Lose All", contains evidence of the cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (in the second report, particularly common rape and electric hits) and the harsh depression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is hard to read, because such incidents take place every week," says the organization Human Rights Watch Indonesian investigator Andreas Harsono.
The screws have been closed even more, because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of newly populated people from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million residents of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing because Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Muslim islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes from Indonesia.
The Javani family meals sell the gado-gado with crustaceans and mixed vegetables, which is served together with the peanut level.
Locals can't compete with them.
"The Migrants began selling chickens and vegetables more cheaply on the traditional market than local papucs," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"Womans of oil cellanic papua mama will therefore lose their market share."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 electoral campaign to deal with their inequality and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won the presidential palace of Jakarta in Papua 29 in the election district 27, including Pania.
But Papua has changed very little, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, Pania was depressed only two months after Jokowi’s October resignation.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang at Enarotal at the fire on Christmas songs when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from the darkness.
The children of the past told them that they should turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was insulted to their voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot into the children.
One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was set on fire, and the next day things began to escalate.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered to demand justice to a football field in front of the local police station and military control centre.
They wore ceremonial yachts and presented a waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, which ran around and imitated bird songs.
Some protesters started throwing stones on the police and military.
In the event of an agitation, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio. "If the mass shows more than three times the resistance, shoot them down," they said, according to the official document that the magazine has seen in Tim, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
In Yeremia, Kayame (56), the older of the town of Kego Koto, Enarotali, identified a threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"With turning around, I was shot suddenly into a left wrist," he said to the magazine TIM in his bright colors on a tree house veranda.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says that the bullet came from the rows of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot of money, a lot of shots," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw got hit three times by his cousin's shooting.
"I drove to him and studied his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, the magazine TIME, who uses only one name, like many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that he'd come back only to his station's security because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, the Papua Police Press Officer.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi, Jayapura, gave a passionate speech in which he expressed compassion for the families of the victims and allowed him to deal with abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never repeat in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an external mechanism for the resolution of the crimes committed against human rights.
But almost immediately the apologies followed.
"Modern crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
By talking to Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdraws his words, saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "all are settled by law."
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of offences against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody Independent Referencing, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including Pania.
The families of the victims in Pania accepted such claims with a dark suspicion.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people in Pania were afraid to dismantle this incident.
He said he was beaten from the army after he had helped bury four victims.
"After the burying of the bodies, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniaan neighbourhood of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when he went into a conversation between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing catching a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers threw the police with stones that the last responded with warning shots.
But locally, the mobile brigade (Indonesia military police) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we fear revenge," said Times 29 Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured entry.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the detention of police officers and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the region.
Paniaia has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, many, dani and damali tribes living in Papua’s hallowing midweekland.
Many of them have joined the Army of the Free Papua Movement (VPL), which defends the rights of the Papua, according to their own, by randomly organising attacks and assaults among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL drivers come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has arrested thousands of people in Pania during the last few years and held unresponsively.
Some of them never come out again.
Among the Papua people, Paniah is known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds unsatisfactory.
The less rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy the locals.
The bread is the same.
People grow their entire food themselves primarily with batates, in addition to some fruits and peanuts.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five battalions.
They usually keep most of the yields for the family, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten batates only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have been deepened between indigenous papuds and new migrants, who have arrived a great deal since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.
These few jobs, which exist, go better for educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuaes often lack capital or skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying, because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of the Pania tribes.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition to external media, strict restrictions remain.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out from Papua because "they were not following appropriate practices", although they had been given a rare filming authorisation.
According to Vice-President Phelim Kine, Jokowi's electoral promises for promoting transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists attempting to report from the most peaceful provinces in the eastern part of Papua and from Western Papua are threatening new threats of visa rejection and black listing," he said in the statement.
The lack of a cagey view of journalism means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate the shooting in Papua, including the United Nations Human Rights Council.
These same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia dismissed the accusations of the group, saying to journalists Jakartas: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so that evidence of anti-human cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more attention to foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation came to visit Kees Van Bar with the country's human rights ambassador, on 4 May, Jayapura, the local people interrupted the meeting, but anonymous, according to the source that wanted to remain, asking for their silence, "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, the new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popees do not believe that they will vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of the tribes.
He wants to understand to Jokowi that, in addition to the constant threat of a predatory army, the people of Pania are suffering from misery due to the education and health services of the Nigels.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other papuds, hold their voice to Jokow as a debt he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and fears, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania managed to bury one of the victims on the ground against the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice will never be put on the ground, at least the responsible will not let them forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a fallen head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed Dubai Torch's cloud blower for the second time.
Fire on Friday through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 337 metres and 79-story building.
It's another fire that's only been destroyed in two years by a high-built building that happens to be called Torch, Tork Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were presented.
"We slept and woke up on the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and we took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to the civilian defence officers in Dubai, the firefighters erased the flame by local time at about 4 a.m. (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to secure the shelter.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-built buildings around the world.
The investigation carried out by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire found that the most damage suffered by the fasque panels and isolations of the external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that London’s isolation of Grenfell Tower and the Fasate panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that took place in June, where around 80 people died.
See: these phones will probably be sold in autumn
In spring and autumn there is a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring came to sell Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, also in the autumn there are new hit phones for poelettes.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, today's flagship is characterised by an innovative design, an eyelid scanner, a screen and a super-speed processor with a resolution of 4K to the edge.
In the technology world, Samsung Galaxy S8, a great excitement was created, which has also reached the front part of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In the autumn, it allows smart people to avoid even more speedy downloads, more resistant battery, more quality cameras and greater water and dust security.
He added that, on the basis of the news, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that are probably conquesting the sales tables of the year.
These four top models of smartphones will reach poets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poets already in the middle of September.
The rumors of what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do with it are spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not produce significant differences on the iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to have a new model completely differentiated from earlier.
It's about four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the whole phone's front panel, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader has been built in the screen.
The Apple Design Manager JonyIve requires the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
It has also been about the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the optic scanner, wireless loading, and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's a year's expecting smartphones.
Preliminary delivery of the Uhi New Model Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
There's been a lot of hearings about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is heard that even more business users are designed and S Pen offers even greater functionalities.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a broadband and the other is a telescope with a narrower viewpoint.
At present, no one knows what two back cameras are capable of, but in any case this is the first Samsung test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 in quality.
But we look forward to August 23st.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in the front of Nokia 6 this year, their flagship - Nokia 8 is still missing, which is already presented on 16 August.
We wait for the screen from Nokia to the edge of 5,3 chairs and the superspeed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and more resistant battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also an indication of aluminium body weight and a significant level of water and dust security IP68.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia model has two back cameras that the optic produces the company Zeiss.
If Sony's fixed flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functions.
We look forward to a smart phone that is a little less modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
For Sony's new model, it's speculated that its screen is at least six-foot.
As a reality comes, we will be able to see the right point because Sony has traditionally published its autumn flagship on the international technology theme IFA, which will take place this year until 1-6 September.
According to the transkripts that have leaked the phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published the transkriptes between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the telephone calls between Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On 27 January Trump called the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop public preaching so that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States was shaking with him for the public judgment of the wall, saying, "You must not say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and swear that Mexico will pay for this project.
Transkriptes were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a intense exchange of thought.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on Australia's refugees is "smart", "smart" and "fun". He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would leave him a "smart" impression because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump finished the call by informing Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Tribunal did not consider the MRP City Liins of OÜ in the case in which the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order by rejecting OÜ MRP City Liinid's offer in Tartu's bus contract, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, the director of the municipality of Tartu.
This is a public bus transport contract within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Liins appealed to the Court of Justice of Tartu to the judgment of the District Court.
The Tribunal did not take this procedure.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their nighttime and the whole city is full of drunken parties, there are many people who do not have any bad words to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any darkness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the genus Laine.
"It's great to be come, be and rejoice in Pärn, which is in winter as a winter sleep," he adds joyfully.
The stubborn wave from the beach doesn't bother you.
When he lived in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not reached his homelife.
"But I hope to hear it," he says gladly.
Agnes also tells us that the big festival is more good for Pärnu -- that is a great contribution to the local traders.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The party noise won't interfere with the woman.
Even though I'm no longer on the beach, it's great that the beach has revived.
And it's nice that the people are moving, and it's been three times this way," says the woman.
I think it was a little worse for the first time.
"So maybe there were complaints," she meditates.
However, the noise at the beach is normal for the summer leaders.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri in the park.
Noise and noise haven't hit his life rhythm either.
What do you mean?
We should all stay together.
Thinking about how it would be better to communicate between nations.
The man in loud music won't be ruined.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live near that.
"Good people can hold together and no trouble," he speaks.
He said the guests to the Pärnu are polite.
"Of course, they have exaggerated a little bit, but young people are young and the Lord God - go on, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
By this time, residents on the beach have traveled away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively, people like this noise", says Pärnus children walking with Tiina.
His family’s dream festival music is not disturbed either, although last year it went even further than this.
Last summer there was a different stage, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that it actually goes far from the Pärnu River quite well," he says.
Pearson cuts 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut 3000 jobs and reduce its intermediate figures by 72% by launching another restructuring programme to solve the risk of business.
According to John Fallon, lost jobs are likely to be combined with 4000 posts lost in the previous restructuring process at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced the plan of May to cut costs in the third cost reduction programme by GBP 300 million (394 million U.S. dollars) to try to revive the business that has been gained due to the transition to rapid digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell the shareholding in the Penguin Random House company last month to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales was reported at GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Assault in Kabul: Nato soldiers were killed in a suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one of the NATO soldiers and injuring several of you.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and translators were injured.
According to unauthorised local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of acts of violence that have been hit by Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in Herat's mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, the suicide bomber killed two people near the embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
The NATO statement said a Thursday night explosion took place when the Afghan army was attacked by a "man-made explosion body".
According to the statement, they are all injured in a stable state and are treated at the US Military Hospital at the Bagram airport.
According to the correspondent, the Taliban and the group known as the “Islamic State” (ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabaghh in NATO Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the shiit area.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people killed a massive bombing in the city of Central - this is the most involved in the military assault in the country since the U.S. forces rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States of America Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of military forces in the country and police aiding US forces.
According to the correspondent, suicide attacks in Kabul have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan in recent weeks.
EPA revoked the decision to postpone the order
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has revoked its decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-time regulation, which obliges the States to limit the emissions of gases caused by gases, one day after the 15 State states have complained about this visit to the court.
The EPA announced the decision to continue with the Ozone Determination Operations 2015 late on Wednesday, saying that this demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to negotiate and listen to our partners," said the EPA leader Scott Pruitt in the statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the intention of rejecting the determinations of ozone in the different parts of the country to determine where the level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
15 mostly democratic states, together with the Columbia District, were brought up on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to draw back a number of environmental regulations introduced by the former President Barack Obama, which Trumpi said is part of a more broad economic growth market plan.
But these efforts have led to counteracting among democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of getting sick in respiratory diseases", such as as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
The German pigs and cattle may have a party, as strong rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it can be said that the hundreds of weeks before harvesting the harvest can mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
In this year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be fed to animal feed, which is double compared to normal, predicted in Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfalls, which have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to Northern Germany, where the rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
In most areas, the harvest has not yet started, the local harvest buyer in Ceravi reported it.
"There are quite difficult days," said the Ceravis senior dealer Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in all or Finnish inner design stunts
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairy homes, because the magnificent views of the Saimaa fish are reached in many (life) rooms through large windows.
Every step, our northern neighbours will see their efforts to create both harsh and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
The use of Finnish wood in construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products is also worth admiration and observance.
A builder and a (house) designer can find refreshing techniques and smart solutions in the fairhouses.
It shows that black, white and grey coatings, if these additional wooden tones and rooms, can be very moody.
Good ideas can come up for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
The accessories and pearpots suggest that there is often cooking in this kitchen.
The night against today, a line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Balticu, and Martin Garrix gave himself everything to keep in mind as the last performer.
During Garrix's performance, the people were really turning -- singing, singing, singing -- dancing.
When Garrix was finished, the mass of Pärnu was dispersed from the beach to the city.
We'll bring you to a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught in Weeken for three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision rate to meet for the first time on Thursday, met in the most fascinating boxing match in the near future, up to 66.7 kg weight category.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, an invincible World Boxing Council Champion, walking the other end of the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's feathering champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision, the winning of the former four-fold world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime will be included in the predecessor of the scale table.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects her belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple posed for photographs, manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas noted that there was a "perfect dimension".
"I'm ex-guaranteed," recalled Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner for [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move downwards, lightweight.
And he needs to move upwards to lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what the fans have wanted.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Pox World needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be worth looking at it, which is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenkol debütate at the end of this year at 61.2 kg in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts), who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's fight after their lightweight tits on the Forum on 23 September.
"Beholding this fight could be worthwhile because the fans have wished to do so," Garcia said later, saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the principals.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko's a "powerful fighter" and he can go see his Saturday game.
But Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought that the master of the three divisions from Riverside saw "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this noodle."
According to Garcia, the aim was to show the strength of the impact and then to fight.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension for prosperity between them.
"It's a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation causes so much attention and sumina.
I'm more than ready to work for it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly this.
This will be a good fight."
What are the world angles moving to Estonia?
More than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or visit the family were recorded by the police and border authorities (PPA).
For example, if the soil was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the tuna bull was 4928.
The agencies do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be drawn up at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, this number will be near 2000 in recent years.
The number of residence permit applicants increased jumpingly during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a fixed residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistics Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia - the bubble arrived in Estonia by 850 Ukrainian citizens more than left.
"Ukrainan community has been great in Estonia all the time, and because of the complex circumstances of the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already ahead", mentioned Kristin Rammus, the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians authorised for a fixed-term residence was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years, the number of permanent residence permits has been issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here mostly to work, then the Russian citizens for their family.
"In view of this historic Russian community, they are likely to have the most family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, the Migrationist of the Academy of Internal Defence.
"If you see where the Russian citizens who have received the residence permit of Estonia have moved to live, then after Harjumaa it is immediately East-Virumaa," she added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married the European Union citizen.
The soil received a fixed-term residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits decreased.
"The hypothesis is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to enter Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia may be applied for by foreigners living here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
For example, a residence permit for a long-term resident is required for five years.
As a result of a new residence permit, the renewal of the old residence permit is likely to be reduced.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer give the impression whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants for the soil still gray passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese people, received residence permits for the purpose of moving to Estonia.
By the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years it is a surprise to become a country from Nigeria, whose citizens are one of the more active applicants for Estonia's residence permits.
When three residence permits were granted to Nigerians in 2007, then 200 bucks.
Nigeria comes to colleges here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgian, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning migration.
The rule also applies to those where the community has emerged, and there will be more easily others", added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If some 6000 third-country nationals receive an annual residence permit, this is about 0.46 per cent of the population as a whole.
Even if the citizens of the European Union think about a percentage of migration," Maasing commented that the figures actually are small.
According to the Statistics Office, 14 822 people traveled to Estonia, and 13 792 out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year's emigration.
Most of the outsourcing and intruders are Estonian citizens, but more are among the departing people.
Therefore, the migration of Estonian citizens was in a mine of 2,000 people.
Estonians travel especially between Finland and Estonia.

That's the point of thinking that put a rolling plan to bring a high fashion in Estonia into rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often unable to reach the mood.
For example, the Mammu collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvis and Pärnu fashions, where the royal defile of 45 models filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, they are often taken in a store, stabbed with dignity, but other emotions are more - crying braavo, rising up, wanting to thank you.
A large part of the audience came to news, but now they're Mammu Couture's fans.
If you cross people's expectations, they're excited!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my manners like a summer trip.
We had a 50-foot red carpet in the Pärn, full of beautiful dresses, seemed like they weren't going to end!
Maria does not recognize the fashionable that the creation must be presented to the supersale supermodel, he will gladly bring on the stage of normal women.
Often I invite my own clients on the stage, they're always happy.
It's such a lovely experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show, but I'm always behind the stage to give the last simplicity as a hopeless perfectionist to things.
My nervousness wouldn't let you watch the hall slowly.
Maria is this kind of fashion runner who wants to be not only in the representation role, but in the hands of all things.
I have my seaming machine in the studio, most of the collections I do.
I like the whole process you play with the details, you find out.
I'm never far from being created, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited, including stylists, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit into a temperamental woman's day.
You know, these hours of work are going to come to the fanatians.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I've still been very lucky - it's like an incontinuous happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliment.
How many times has it been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
Mammu Couture has remained the signatories until today.
Martin Müürsepp of the boys U18: the Estonian subgroup tournament's weapon was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale's over.
The first thing I missed was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's so much difference in the table, there's nothing to do", said Eesti U18 basketball boys 61:75 of our only NBA-played basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assist coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the assault table and got so much more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive protection or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
In defense, they could hold between hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
That's what hit the team.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to Müürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical errors to take the momentum of the opponents down.
In the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and a tight entrance, which was on the subgroup tournament, our weapon, now all turned against us.
Today, we had no strength to resist their aggression.
The mushroom remained in Calev, Matthias Tass, with his care.
On the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, so far, there is a single fist.
It's a pity that you've already met such an aggressive opponent.
The cab has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he's been carrying quite a load.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen before in my workouts," he added the instructor.
Horrible numbers: in the young girls' basketball box, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points at three quarters...
In the U18 age class, there is not only a basketball tournament for young men in EM B division in Tallinn, and the girls started overnight in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was certainly in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took off the gas pedal, and that period was 16:16.
In the first and second quarter, Estonia threw 4, on the third 1 points...
In the beginning, the Estonians hit two of the first four whiskeys in two minutes, and then 25 of the game, then one in three, and then another in 21 shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 whiskeys were hit.
In addition, 2 points came from the four free visions.
There was a reasonable number of extinguishments in this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had the visketabavus 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day it had to be acknowledged that Portugal 83:56 was better.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Tonight, NATO 1 permanent mining team arrived for a scheduled port visit to Tallinn for the weekend, to complement the stocks of ships and prepare for the forthcoming exercises.
During the visit, ships are preparing to return to the sea, giving crew members the opportunity to take a couple-day leave.
After a visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and to be ready for future operations for historic explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters is well reflected in our integration with alliance forces," said Commander General Arto Reinmaa, the commander of the Operation and Planning Department of the Navy.
With effect from 29 June, NATO's 1st permanent mining group is led by the Latvian naval captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the group commander's duties in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elia, Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is assigned to the Latvian Maritime Support Ship of LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates a group management station.
This semester also includes the composition of the international unit of the Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under the NATO Marine Command is NATO 1 permanent mine control group of primary high-speed reactors, which can be sent to different world places within five days of the Alliance.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will become a place where 13 years ago the Birgitta Festival of the Maestro Eri Klas was called.
The Birgitta Festival of this year, according to Risto Joost (36), can be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented by the artistic director of the Philharmony in Tallinn.
Risto Joost: The classic of the opera world includes "Travita" and "Tosca", balletry responses from the luxurious "Bolerost" to "Karlssonin", and there is no plan for their own production, which this time is Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorial "Ages" stage by the same international creative team that brought Pirital to the stage in 2015, Haydn's second masterpiece "Looming".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre feasts.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival that entices power and never really lets go again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this super and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touch human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maestro Eri Class shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Class, it has been very helpful.
He directed me through my student career and also supported me at the beginning of the governing career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
The different class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much goodness and, of course, it will carry all over me.
It was great to join the team who knows how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at the festival this year, which you offer specially?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet written in the Astrid Lindgren story will be presented.
"Karlsson is flying."
And there's one malignant clue that this ballet is the author of the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a wish to write this work.
He's probably had Karlsson's character in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive life mate, I'm sure.
Such a work requires support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't so much dependent on other people as far as I'm concerned, how I'm going to resist every new day.
And such consciousness of voice, keeping positiveness and actually smiling to himself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I've been working on it particularly delicately and it works.
Smiling itself activates the brain and raises the voice.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know half the things that the universe offers to them yet, but everyone finds it even.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you enter the driver's remote?
It's true, you need to change your clothes for more comfortable.
This is the moment for yourself.
But generally, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before I do a big show, or make a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before they step into the control unit.
But all of you come to Birgitta Festival, here's what you can find, not to a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the moodful video with Risto Joosti!
New results of the age assessment tests of Swedish asyl seekers were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asyl seekers in which medically evaluated their age with a new approach. The latest results of the test indicate that more than 80 percent of the graduates were evaluated older than 18, but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Medicine Institute (Rättsm Medicine Verket) started with the tests on the beginning of this year.
The tests were established for a more accurate assessment of the age during the application for acyl after the Swedish Migration Verket was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged minor refugees.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Institute of Justice has issued 2481 results from mid-March 2017 to 31 July.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years old or older, and in 25 more cases, the Institute of Justice assessed that the testable "may be 18 years old or older".
In the case of 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18".
Tests shall be used only if the age of a person is under the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, the judiciary at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent in comparison with previous months.
"We do not see a large difference compared to the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to the The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asyl seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 results in May and said that in 442 cases, there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older.
But when Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test, it turned out that in 243 cases, man had said directly that he would be in this year 18.
This medical age assessment method in which smart-hamed X-ray images and knee-ign MRT are performed, followed by dentists and radiographs, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinoologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose duties include an assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed the puberty before or later.
"I have had a reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement method that is currently being used.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for certain, then we should not make a face that we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests in the Institute of Justice: "In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurate adultisation is low.
The highest, maybe about 10%, is a risk if a person is a little less than 18."

The 20 - year - old left - gratifier Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London MM, receiving a good 18th place in 67.37.
Orel was M.M.'s youngest female-leader, and a happy woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well, and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel MMi's debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall didn't interfere with Orel because he trains through the winter on the Twentieth stadium.
"I'm karized," he said with a little dick.
The Olympics of London had almost a whole house of people, or did Orel perceive people around him, or could he turn themselves off?
I get it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more - that's right!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel assured me that the MMi will remain in peace with the debut and there will be many good competitions: "I came here with the 32th season of this year, or the last result, I ended up at 18th.
It's a very good result.
I'm 20 and MM-- that's the only thing that matters.
I take a good experience with you, and some days I want to compete for the medals.
The Governor of Western Virgina announced the party exchange
Governor Jim Justice, of the Western Virginia Democrat, announced on Thursday night a meeting with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"Thank you or not, but the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you, having prayed a lot and thought about it... today I will tell you, the Western Virginias, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the gathering, joy gained.
"This will make me a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"A coach I would tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won at 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he owns coal business from his father.
His value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the exchange of the governor of Justice is another strike to democratic parties, which would rather prevent the country from becoming better than working for it".
"For the 15 kubernarian places and control of the lowest number of states in history - the Governor Justice announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the parties which have been run for the end, and cannot find a positive and interconnecting message," said RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel in the CBS News statement.
There's no surprise where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured.
Last night, Urmet in the medical tent of the week said that they had to share a lot of patches.
Wilds and wrenches are fundamental, out of torque and light falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false footsteps and so come the problems.
Medics have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - have had some panic attacks and one leg fracture.
We have also made sewings when a man has broken his hand or his finger.
Smaller seams are done here, bigger ones are sending you to the hospital.

Coe congratulated the Russians' honest apologies for the doping channel.
According to her, the international noseman of light force, Sebastian Coe, praised for the Doping Candal of the Russian Thursday, but repeated that it is not time for the country to return to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian mild force noseman, said at the IAAF Congress on the vicinity of the lightweight world championships, that his country's ban on competition is correct and he has a firm aim to fight the doping.
He apologized to "all light-powered stylists from whom the gold and silver medals have been consumed in the races."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining a ban on competition, which was introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dogping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of the state's supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, with a very honest presentation," said President Coe of IAAF to journalists.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian subconfederation itself acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and that they will make everything possible to reorganise the federal union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its renewal.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but the Congress supports the group's proposal that it is not the time for Russia to be withdrawn," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been on the basis of the principle that we want clean athletes to be separated from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweightists who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete on Friday in the light power world championship competitions in London as neutral sports kids.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Group, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of improvement criteria.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control is still inadequate and that coachs who have received a ban are still free to work.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
The fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining guns like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
Glencore is currently serving coal and oil, but in the electric car age, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will grow.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norwegian Governments have increased their contribution to the spread of electric cars, which allow for the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
For that reason, Volvo has already known that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring on a cheaper model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that over two decades more electricity cars are sold than those used by oil fuels.
"For some of the metals it changes everything," said the raw materials analyst of Capital Economics to Simona Gambranin Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium with increased demand for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in the normal car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed in loading stations, and Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by 2025 by about five percent.
The increase in demand for battery electric cars is an additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore receives income from the trend of growing electric cars from copper price increases and from the fact that he is the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are the other winners of the race for electric cars.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the cobalt on the London metal exchange has cost 70 percent.
The price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also been expensive by 14 percent this year, mainly due to growth.
Glencore's share in London increased by 20 per cent, overcoming the rival of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine need to adapt to the new age.
The main end use of the lead is battery supplying gasoline and diesel-powered car launchers.
Electric cars use litium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk for lead demand unless it is found to have another purpose to overcome the decline in demand," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the analyst director of the metal market Michael Widmer.
The impact of the sliding trend is not yet observed in the form of a lead price movement.
Lead has grown by 17 percent in this year, which is the best metal in London as price rises among the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems for metal in the long future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps normal cars in competition," said the metal broker company Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand for lead falls, it will be slow.
It could happen in about ten years.
To date, however, the stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depends on advanced lead-based accumulators in the run of frequent engines, is increasing by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel because the lighter car can drive further by less electricity.
This is explained by an additional 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for the period 2013-2016.
It represents 2.7% of total aluminium production in the world.
Probably this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficiency.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of stunning car frames.
Also ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop lighter alloys of steel to resist aluminium.
"The saturated steel should be a response to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
It took about half of this precious metal for diesel-powered car catalysts, announced by the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Most currently high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have a high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but they become important within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe that there is an ongoing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, the leader of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025.
In the 10 years' perspective of platinum producers, Toyota Motor and Hyundai Moto are developed hydrogen-based cars, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, until now, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Dissel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers received a major retaliation because Stuttgart’s court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unlimited spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the Governing Body, which runs the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the Prestigious Masters League tournament, Paris is still waiting for Saint-Germain.
The financial rules on fair game established in UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that the PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) alone for buying out the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's salary is going to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to use such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-to-the-art series, given that the team is funded by the family in charge of Katar’s energy crime.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on players to recruit, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that the clubs that succeeded in searching for large debts actually deal with fraud and risk deterioration when banks or owners should give up their support.
Since 2011, FFP focuses on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of the FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make high costs to make the team better and create a global trademark - is more difficult to implement.
FFP may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million during the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018.
And despite the disgrace of Platin in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said last week to the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is an FFP supervisor in UEFA.
While the PSG paid for Neymar’s overpurchase clause as a single full outlet, it is possible for them to distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which is why it is possible to show the transitional fee in the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year.
As regards the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with the Manchester City of Abu Dhabi, was punished most severely.
A fine of EUR 60 million (this time 82 million) was imposed on the PSG, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club required to limit the Championship team during the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is searching for clubs that can try to overshadow regulatory financial institutions by blowing their incomes up through companies related to club owners.
The Katari company may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority’s PSG contribution was recovered.
It has been reported that a certain part of Neymar’s PSG may come from Catarina through payments by the 2022 World Championship Management Committee.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymarist could become a World Championship, and claim that UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in respect of any attempt to ignore rules.
The people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed Neymar’s switchover with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports indicate that the PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in the period 2015-2016 at around EUR 542,4 million in turnover.
Data have not yet been published for the last financial year.
The PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects at least 30 % increase in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish League, having clearly irritated the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that the PSG would infringe the FFP.
"This is a clear "money doping" case with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Katari.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares the view that the state finances the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights and has completely changed the whole football landscape for the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent the country of such a great player."
The Norwegian low cost airline has a nice tradition to put on the airplane board pictures of those who have moved borders in their own area and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee
In conjunction with the expansion of Norwegian action geography, the circle of people who have earned a place in the airplane has also expanded.
Among the individuals selected are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo and Miguel de Cervantes.
But in the near future, Freddie Mercury's legendary singer will be decorating an airplane.
50 years ago today: hurricane storm in Estonia, which ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The storm of the hundredth storm referred to the hurricane, which caused major damage to West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
In Northwest Estonia, the wind was more than 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran out of a carving tree in the garden to another and touched them with his hands to support them.
It was all dark and rageful, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalust recalled the interview of the Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw how his planted garden collapsed.
But what are you still supporting with wooden hands where you're gonna get against this storm?
The sea came under the window, sprayed into the water from the windows," said Mrs. Linda living on the Haapsalus Kalda street.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the railroad roof had flew 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of the slayers just like the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the loop, some completely down, some half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm went out of beautiful old trees as a rage and a rage like a war.
West Virumaa could not suffer particularly severely in the storm of August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damages were also great there, wrote Virumaa in 2007.
The Haapsalu Loss Park and Padise Park were wiped off the ground eggs, but the parks on our pool were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, no more than 35 metres of wind was measured per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, at the Maritime Field, a little girl cried at the evening of 6 a.m.: "Mama, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!", wrote Virumaa Journal.
During the storm, the Põll Mansion building in Viljandimaa destroyed so much that it was decided to detonate later.
Augusttorm was unable to cope with the designs of Tyr skiing mountain, which were no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from the fallen trees and their oxes is slowly progressing, and the inhabitants could take part in the cleaning work.
The feral crops were also severely affected in the Torm, and the newspaper reported that "partial organisations must be enthusiastic and guided both in the process and in the harvest".
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969 when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
The meter broke on the island of Onlydloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing beaches: night cleaning work and poor beach weather
Cold summer eyes also mean a smaller harvest in Tallinn bathing beaches.
"If there is no weather, there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people", the beach cleaner admits.
The guinea pigs cried at Strom's beach in North Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition on low turns with a drained tractor that squeezes the stripes on the patch.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep through the sand is sewed by collecting out of it the rafts of the sea and the left of people: bottle caps, cigarettes and others.
People are still coming to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, the Haberst Administration of the beach cleaning work manager.
It's 6:30 and there's a bit of a cleaning job on the beach, because at eight o'clock, the place has to be good for people.
Usov's already on the post at 4:00.
After Strom, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare on the Pikakar beach.
The volume of waste has decreased.
It was a lot more years ago.
People are already able to appreciate what they are doing," says Usov, who has cleaned the beach for 15 years.
Before anything new was set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea waste or adrug.
For example, at the Pirita beach, it must be transported to 400 000 tonnes at the sea season.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second large category is the waste of people, perhaps all that people leave behind.
There are eight large waste containers on a half-kilometre beach strip that need to be emptyed three times a week.
That's the amount of garbage.
However, the colder summer eyes have meant that garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species constitutes abandoned things.
Mostly, they're kids.
As a harvest this time, Usov has swept tens of model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for the owners on the beach.
Usuov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Disperse the waste
The representative of the Haberst Administrative Services, Erika Scholler, admits that the tractor screening work is disturbing the locals.
The noise that lasts from night to early morning mixs the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
It's impossible this day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't do this, the part of the city will punish us," says Scholler.
However, similarly to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get Strom's beach under the quality mark of the international bluewood.
"In spilling with Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are taken care of," says Scholler.
We have more grey and stones and harder to sew the sand.
However, there are less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near Strom's beach, will forcelessly enter into a discussion circle of journalist and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a terrible picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags out of their heads," Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviours, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with garbage boxes and put them on covers, for example, to prevent at least birds from being in progress.
Generally speaking, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Strom coast.
It is seen that the city will take care of it.
Children’s courts, lighted and freshly asphalted roads have become more enjoyable.
Once it was that rollers could only drive one way," says Martin.
Inventions of treasure hunters in Strom: coins, only coins
The morning season has come to be used by the 40-year-old Dimitri, who combets the beach with a metal detector.
He doesn't think that today or in the future anything precious will be found.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough to do that.
"I've been working on it for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobberry shell, some euro coins, bottle caps and dangerous pounds are in Dmitri's treasure shell, which will throw out the garbage box later.
Usually there are coins.
"Dude, rings and other things aren't usually there," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at the previous level, as the strong economic growth and inflation relieved speculation in relation to the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a spell because households' lace incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of holding at 6.2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened the support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the 2017 growth forecast by 1.7% and its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income remains, as inflation is still expected to rise near 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in the rates will be necessary to control inflation due to Brexit in the next few years and that the financial markets may need a higher increase in the expected loan costs.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economy-marketing mammoth package as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will terminate a fixed-term financing scheme, which will provide banks with low-cost funding, although said that it is now expected to offer GBP 15 billion higher in the framework of this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the protocols of the decision taken on the quantum, the bank says: "In the mid-term forecast of theMPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain inevitable in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household income will continue to affect consumption."
On the definitions, it was repeated that it is necessary to "financial policy to make some effort" in order to mitigate inflation, and to the extent that "more than" is expected in the markets.
The stock exchange now predicts the first rise in the third quarter of the following year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the Bank underlined that all jumps are gradual and limited.
Bank reduced growth forecasts for this year and for the next year are comparable to 1.9% and 1.7% in May forecasts.
The projection for growth of 1.8 % in 2018.
After that news, the GBP rate fell for the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to 0.5% 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointment growth indicators, which have suppressed growing hopes in relation to the increase in GDP in the second quarter, increased by 0.3% from 0.2% of the previous three months.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will be a little slow.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for rejoicing the households suffering from rising inflation and a slight increase in wages, saying that the situation will get a little worse before he recovers.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact on income in the next few years, but the end of the three-year forecast is expected to be a significant recovery of wages.
Due to the weak pound, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially compensate for smaller consumer costs.
The decision will come one year after the figures were passed by 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that four years will be spent to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the last decision of the Bank, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on households; in July three policy makers required an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the next few months.
The Bank said that over-increased growth compared to the 2-protective objective was entirely due to weak naela.
Coreco's manager of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become increasingly competitive because lenders want work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are to be completed, as refinancing, often without service and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is describing the anti-HIV medicine that inflicted 10,000 people
Patients will have access to preventive treatment of "transformative" HIV from September following the battle in the Supreme Court on whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England announced that national health care is now expected to make 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets available to humans during the initial three-year clinical trial, which are administered before the interim and which have shown a decrease in risk of infection by approximately 86% in people at high risk.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the previous year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
The NHS England Managing Director, Simon Stevens, welcomed the action published on Thursday as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National aid fund (NAT) described it as a "verse moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to register people. In October more clinics will be added before the program is launched everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-existence prevention (PrEP) is a surgeon of HIV medicinal products that is taken prior to intervening in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
The use of PrEP prior to intercourse means that there are sufficient amounts of medicinal products in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours prior to the interval.
Appropriate candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners have been infected with HIV and are not treated.
Clinics identify appropriate people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsole people and those whose HIV partner does not receive anti-retroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their participation in the local sexual health clinic in the programme.
The programme pays GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of whom the medicine is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen the fight against the wider and increasingly successful spread of HIV.
This is another verstapost in the fight of more than three decades with one of the greatest health problems of mankind."
Deborah Gold, NAT Managing Director, said, "This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if this is properly targeted for those who need it and belong to a risk group, it offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidaemia of England.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risks in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually managed and is not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
The Executive Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation Ian Green said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is rapidly delayed and that no member of the HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that PrEP's clinical trial has been obtained, we are on our way there to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of infecting HIV.
People's shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the pre-EP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the squeeze of the government's legs.
The evidence shows the extent to which this medicinal product can lead to the end of HIV prevention and its spread of life-changing infection.
This clinical trial leads us to a step closer to the full understanding of PrEP's benefits.
It is now important that the clinical attempt will be taken into force as soon as possible in order to protect people with HIV exposure and bring us closer to a step towards stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity in Estonia rose by 12%, however, in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in exchange price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania’s prices decreased to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main cause of price differentiation is the failures of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average stock price of electricity was 34.33 euros of megavat-hour last month and the price was up by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to EUR 36.27 from the megavat-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price for Nord Pool was EUR 26.37 per megavatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved from 75% of the previous month’s hours in Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours used the whole transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the last trading day of July, the OMX market of Nasdaq may result in a stock price of about EUR 34 and EUR 37 from the megavat-hour in August.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity rose last month and the transaction took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Higher living - half-store and clever designs have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a roomy home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate renovator, changed his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 to Earls Court apartment.
It is located on Queen Anne Terrace's first floor, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed up his bags and sold the apartments is a respect for the new design.
"Before I lived on a much larger surface with a former partner in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equal to the price I offered.
I was shown to have this Earls Court apartment, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, the 93 square metre apartment has passed a complete innovation curve.
At first, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired the architectural and design studio of Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to make use of 3.8 m heights of ceilings and create a home that is not just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-store where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the spaces so that they would be on each other's side without supposed to be dizzy.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure so that the height of both the upper and the lower space would be right."
This regulation allowed Erfan to create two rooms of full heights in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the half floor, the old copper light opens from the Retrouvius window to the glamorous living room.
The golden furniture, silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille lighting highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and the luminous abundance.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor are attached so that it appears longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with the mirror leaves the look of the window opening into the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage room for all Joanne's dishes and glassware.
The living room adds charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen section, if not used, creating a vision of a more glamorous space.
The kitchens clinging together are nothing new.
At this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a garage-type door to be raised.
"There's a bit of a projection shortage," explains Erfan the door from the MDF with steel stiffness.
"It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily if it rejects it."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and storage room, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"In the end, the floor surface is what you sell - or the one that gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker comes into the room in an obsolete form and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional connection with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart ring."
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area helps to make quite a normal apartment something amazing.
In fact, they could cause a wish not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Headmaster Dane Jensen is a Chicago Cloud Hunter who is competing with a colleague for promotion.
It is not counted as a sum of money earned, with which all ethics are forgotten.
His wife and three children will only see a man in the early morning and late night.
In the first half of the film, I'm thinking that it's a "Card House" business world version - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech machine are similar.
What the film continues to do, the less the cladical element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers is becoming more and more likely.
A life-changing experience for the main person, the son’s disease becomes cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between working life and family life.
The son who dreams of the Architect's Office makes his father walk to the large buildings of Chicago think about real important things such as faith, goodness, love... and not touching even the twins disaster.
After the third scene in which the son opens his eyes, it appears that the filmmakers have made the goal of the audience surely crying, because even the most expensive viewer with his heart cannot keep tears back from seeing the suffering of the lovely cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma, and his situation seems to be hopeless, his father will finally understand his work of morality and do a good work for an old man who is looking for work.
Now I'm betting on myself - if the movie has a happy feeling, I'll reward my vision after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the scener may be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'll never miss the coffee when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man's sneaking through the hallway.
The son, however, is miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, is positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama pretty well!
When giving truth, the film is well constructed, there are all the elements needed for it.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie brings you in well.
Trump's new staff manager is planning to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do that.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new staff manager of the White House intends to limit the information flow of President Trumpin, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the boss evener in water.
Here's the interruption from reporter Josh Dawseyl:
"When John F. Kelly, the new staff chief of the White House, first working day, met with the high officials, he identified the key issue of President Donald Trump in the White House, which he was planning to solve the lack of information in the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information must move through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if they shared good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it and they have failed to control Trump's media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes beyond decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits are not missing.
"If the candidate Trump was mad about an unfair media projection, it was worth showing him that he was also genuinely reflected in the impressive publications," said former campaign counselor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "the six former campaign workers said Trumpi was the key to controlling Twitter-traditional practices by ensuring that its personal media consumption also contains stable praise songs".
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trumpi Twitter have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don't know would have been even more flammable without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the twists Trump didn't mail.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble for a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from continually causing a problem.
Some of the problem is that people in the White House competing with each other's competing clicks are trying to promote their own interests exclusively by transmitting to Trump the material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote in May the advisers’ tendency to feed the President with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Previous and former Trump say that Trump may respond to a negative press, especially injurious information leaks, explosively, obsessing their source of identification.
This is also the case at the end of February when someone gave the President a copy of the printed copy of the web projector Charles C. Johnson’s website GotNews.com, which accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a source of the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of smiling, or that he has not provided any concrete evidence, or that he has made false charges in the past and has withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking for Walsh from the subordinates."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter " has attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that can reach Trumpin".
How'd that work?
Kelly's trying to do the exact same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll be more effective than Priebus, but Trump's still impulsive and his assistants will still compete for the impact.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The street musicians from the capital are not allowed to perform bitterly.
In the city centre of Tallinn many foreigners go to music.
The ones that the Dinner had spoken to, they admitted to play in the old town without permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with racial taps and broken clothing were backpackers who could use a shower for berries.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm on acorion, while a man next to him in a jungleer with three balls and called the passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a screw-up himself in his heart.
Their three dogs didn't let the passing people disturb themselves.
Bob, who played the Akordion, told me that they were kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the Society's performance was to collect ticket money on a ship flying to Finland on the same night.
The question is, did they ask the city permission to play in the old town, shake Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city more than a day or a couple, and mostly permits will be granted for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for that," Bob explained.
When we got back to Viru's gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and drive them away.
The Society moved to the Viru Centre intersection with the backpacks and dogs.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other clarnet, and the third of them had brought in an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living", explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the municipality must be authorised to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million in the framework of the euro area central banks’ public asset purchase programme, the central bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase plan includes three different purchasing programmes: bonds covered by the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
In view of the effects of purchases, the return on less risk-adjusted assets falls and motivates investors to take higher risks.
In general, each central bank, under the public bond purchasing programme, buys debts from its government, no bonds from other countries are purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued debt securities, Eesti Pank will make the so-called substitution purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
The substitution purchases shall also be made by the central banks in the countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchasing plan is limited.
Eesti Pank is generally buying bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank purchases bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but from June 2016, the Eesti Pank no longer purchases Elering's bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish central bank purchases both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds from June.
The travelers ignore the drift and return to the "million divisions"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have been reintroduced by vicious opponents who have ignored the council's mining to win back the field from their villas.
The travellers have parked their 20 trailers in the field as a wealthy "million-division" baptized near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were fired out in May, without letting themselves be mixed with the dart that was dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place in the boundary of protection, squeezing their vehicles through the unprotected part that had been left on the foot.
The Solihull council has been squeezed by the Russians, saying that the council is "no useless to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were expelled from Bentley Heath, where they threw the passers with stones.
The Council must be embarrassed to act because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came to the house last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the council tax if the council can't even stop this."
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's ridiculous, but we just saw the last of these travellers leaving, and there's a new attack going on.
This time the number has grown, and the grass has even seen the horse ruining."
The representative of the Solihulli Council said: "We are aware that the land near Streetsbrook road is an unacceptable campsite, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible inform any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
Among others, the Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased to be able to bring true world top names to Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians is the island’s answer that it should be asked to all those who enjoy the festival three days in full.
However, he acknowledges that true men have come to Pärnu.
"With the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musician - that often does not happen in our corner", says the Minister of Culture.
But what are the artists at the festival most speaking?
I think I'm relatively old-fashioned, and for people like me, it's definitely one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren who came up last night.
Well, according to his recordings, we've all been swirling our legs at some point," he says.
But he will bring out a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian authors too: starting from NO
In reality, it is a very high concentration of known names," he says.
Look at the evening video longer!
The audit updates the criticism of car manufacturers in the middle of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said that it offers software supplements for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than passenger restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown in Munich, which has considered the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles to reduce diesel engine emissions in Europe.
None of the companies described these operations as being called back.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have been zealously promoting the use of diesel vehicles in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogen and may cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise diesel vehicles for automotive industries will be increased by making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, the Government of the Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of the heating of powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs that are referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen errors, which silenced the use of so-called defective devices that allowed the emission indicator to be adapted to the regulations at the time of the vehicle testing, but pulled back in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Head of the Thermodynamics Department of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi in Germany was withdrawn from the criminal investigation on Volkswagen when the authorities accused of the installation of the Audit System to circumvent the requirements of the European emissions by extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit into the investigation may be a major attack on Volkswagen by the luxury car manufacturer, which produces disproportionately a large proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union's flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy tickets to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union's flag of 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended for exhibiting indoors, they must be carried out in high-quality printing techniques in the inner spaces with tunnel fixing, the ERR newsportal.
The flagvarda label contains the following text: "Kingitus Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The expected cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000, i.e. one flag costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans for the most recent chaos of Sinalo state sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their security.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two older writers are discussing, which seems safer: whether children are brought to their office, which was the target of a grenades attack in 2009, or leaving them home.
Security experts have written three words on the board in the front of the room: "violence", "neutral", "literals".
They ask the reporters to provide no evidence in each column, enough impressions and inner feelings.
The presence of government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business men and journalists, who pose a risk to reflecting chaos in Mexico.
The majority of these journalists, according to the Defence Committee, are not breathtaking, and the more dead bodies are accumulated across the country, they have been reported to be at least 25,589 journalists in December 2012 since the detention of President Enrique Pena Nieto, after attacks and threats under national protection and, during this year, have still been killed by at least seven journalists in seven states.
The last dead include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, Riodoce’s co-operator.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," wrote Valdez, one of his many narcotics books.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived throughout the facade of the Riodoce building, there is a large picture of the middle finger displaying Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts with his smiled glasses or a typical panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecution was established for the case of journalists in 2010, only two cases have been filed by the Press Defence Committee.
As for most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, the number of thousands, the killers of journalists rarely reach the court.
Riodoce's activity continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the records of the murderers and justice, Ibarra said that the meeting on security is of little use.
"It's a little stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"So long as there's no reason to know, you're questioning everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan, a state capital in the morning of May 15th.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him from red Toyota Corolla, and he was forced out of the car and he was 12 times shot, and it was expected to be because of the name of the newspaper, which means "twelveth River" translated.
The gunman drove out of Valdez's car and accidented it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
The rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence is essentially the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, because the rivalry cliches are fighting for the execution of the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that Sinaloa streets are fired every day by one person or even several people, or that the graveyard is decorated with the mausoleums of the dual-drug queens, which are bigger than the homes of many living.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel leads the state of the sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce, the co-chairer and President Ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the tremendous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing has been promoted by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel that competed with Guzman's sons, and a cartel clicked at war in February.
This part of the letter may have upset the sons by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the interrogation took place in one of the newspapers reflecting the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would exist forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroes' newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said in Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with the press without dealing with the drug problem."
The newspaper gathered a lot of well - known and honest reflections and increased sales and advertising.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous studies without fear of the censorship and readers in a luxurious edition of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won its Latin American echoes for the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize.
The same year, Valdez, the Defence Committee of Journalists (AKK), won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican narcotics story wherever it leads.
He was openly acknowledged that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said to the AKK award.
Last October, he told the television channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the task that the journalist's office will have a second chance to play fools.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
Riodoce's collective misses Valdez, a funny man who rode like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the office to El Guayabo's bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became destined to him.
His death has also made them doubting how to do his job best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're stalking these women, their children, their legal business, the secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things shouldn't have been touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self - sensation and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
The editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, says the problem is, "the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or in other States that are home to the toxicity of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees were gathered for security training, mobile phones were not suddenly allowed; a few days before it it was revealed that only governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the tree.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters wondered if these police officers were part of the 50 percent of the police whose governor himself had sketched unreliable.
How many months have it been since the reporters have traveled to mountain lands where the de facto drug forces have control.
Riodoce this week's edition dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez's former boxing legend in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no formal announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the institutional Revolution Industry (IRP), which was dominated by all policy levels almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread envisionment in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write on previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, the name El Chapo, who bears it, escaped from military forces.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have searched for the Valdez Columbia to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressed bodybuilding has served him with the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all the communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they never expected on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West of Michoacan three days after the death of Valdez.
Found a burnt body, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
The journalists have become louder throughout the country and criticise the SOS press phrase as an organised protest for walking roads and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is in Washington trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, in meeting with Sinaloa's governor, Ramirez accused of sniffing journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked him to be directed to reflect the government’s activities elsewhere, worrying that his anger has affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have been "limited" by organised crime, co-cultural civil servants and any society.
In his last book "Narco journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also under the command of politicians and security forces who are organised in crime.
In the last year, more than half of the press attacks were dedicated to the police and public officials by the Media Channel Surveillance Group Articulo 19.
"A Mexican you'll die because you're wanted to silence," said Ramirez.
Murders are obviously bleeding.
No one forgets the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in the northern border state in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by the cartel in Los Zeta: "I'm here for my reports."
The computer keys and earplugs were lying next to his depressed head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the North Border State in Chihuahua following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo committed the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke with a headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from home countries or even from the country.
It's a nerve rash decision.
It's hard to find work in the exile and they still have to hide the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes, as likely happened to a photographer named Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after he escaped from Veracruz in 2015.
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that he's frightened by the narcotics business.
"Mexico is on his way to hell, and that's why I began to reporter," he said.
One recent Friday midnight, when the latest number was already locked, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and ripped a beer when all the phones suddenly started vibrating.
19 people were killed in the fire exchanges between the rival gangs and the security forces in Mazatlan, on the beachside.
The war continued to escalate, as the left messages of several cartels found in several regions.
On the side of the sidewalk, the reporters put the news on their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Next day's first place needed change.
Another fire exchange in the area was passed by the Sirens.
Bojorquez's hiding to the police guards to see if they're guarded.
If they were afraid, they didn't at least show it out.
Riodoce’s employees delivered his tracks under a massive portrait of the downstairs of the newspaper, where his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa.
"How can you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, asked an intern to send him to the streets to make a report?"
Dinosaurus used defense color to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it seems like a shape, though pretty scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings regarding the incredible nature of the size of the necrosis found by the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Dinosaurs Mona Lisa".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his heels was red brown color and his past had been somewhat "complicated".
The Current Biology report described the nature as "the best preserved soomusdinosaurus, which has never been found" and "the one of the best dinosaurs all over the world".
Fossil is a new type of nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the crystal age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival was taken by scientists who described it as "really significant".
This vegetarian covered with heels is the most preserved fossil that has ever been found in the National Geographic magazine.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he mined Suncor Millenium mine in Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
He hit something that didn't remind me of the surrounding stone, and he decided to examine further.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, the animal was working on digging out of 2500 kilograms (1100 kilos) of land.
After all this harsh effort, the final result is now finally ready to bring the public forward.
"If you kiss a bit of eyes, you can almost believe that he sleeps," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum where the being is exhibited.
"It's going to be the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur - as Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
When he studied his skin, scientists found that this vegetarian, who is covered with armours and resembles a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by the dinosaurs of meat.
This dinosaurus with a large number of heels used red and white shields to hide from predators, and applied a sheltering technique called contraception, which is also used by many animals today.
According to the experts, it allowed dinosaurs to integrate more closely and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110 million - year - old family of nodosaurs first came to the news in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The scientists have now investigated the nature and named it by Mark Mitchell, the Borealopelta Markmitchelli Museum, who was a team that spent more than 7000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Due to the incredibly good survival of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the animal in the body.
They discovered a contraception - a common protection method in the animal country, which means that the main side of being was darker than the bottom.
Although contraception is common, findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much greater than contraceptive animals today.
This implies that dinosaurs were sufficiently actively pursued by other muscle-eating dinosaurs that evolution preferred to be shadowed instead of survivors.
But most of the animals using contraceptive contraception, such as deer, sebras or scaradillies, are much smaller and more vulnerable as a yield, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The strong hunting of dinosaurus, coated with sproutedly large and large armours, shows how dangerous the dinosaurs might have been robbers," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the inferior organic compounds also revealed that the skin of dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal in order to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of the intestine, to find out what the animal had eaten for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaurus fell into the river, thus reaching the sea with a flow, where he fell in front of the ocean floor.
At this time Albertas was as warm as currently in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were probably much further inland than currently.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is fully covered with preserved sexy skin, while it has remained three dimensions, maintaining the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the critic era.
You don't have to use very much imagination to reconstruct this - it's just enough to kiss your eyes and it seems like she's sleeping."
The time of the crisis was the time when the earth flooded with huge dinosaurs of muscle eaters on two feet.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his terrifying predecessors could hunt for the infamous dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weight.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was glorified after death to the sea and this mumifitseered mud.
The existence was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was digging the Millennium Mine in Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved soda dinosaurus in the world, including leather and warmth, and it is a complete conquest to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch squirrels broke out of this shoulder.
Scientists believe that this vegetarian covered with armours adventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river was blurred by this open sea.
However, the underground burial site of dinosaur helped to preserve its warmth incredibly detailed terms.
The stoned residues of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the bones of the dinosaur continue to cover the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine: "This level of survival is as rare as the lottery winner.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The stoned leather residues still cover the noisy skulls on the animal's skull.
The right front foot lies next to him and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count his armies on his plate."
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Who the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell became a complete shock.
Only the day after traveling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat in a room rented through Airbnb on a bed on the phone on Facebook.
After his former schoolmate posted him.
It said, "The police just killed a 18-year-old and he's still on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his flow, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The posts of the Pidemega @TheePharoah user were repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis region forwarded in real time the unarmed 18-year-old blackman's death of Michael Brown, who killed a white cop in Missouri in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell meant himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put away his phone, but later on the night he saw a reset that this time told me about the people gathering at Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of the police and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a note in the letter "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched the flow in real time where the police stood in front of the protestors' group with a dead dog.
In the second video, another cop snatched a gun and yelled, "I kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself by thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not a murder like this that we're used to, and what we could call a typical."
I felt the dreads at the moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a flight back and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, he went to see his father for his six - year - old daughter and decided to drive alone next morning to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (Whose Streets?), which will appear in the movies on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and intensity from the viewpoint of the people living in this community and fulfilling the answers in demand of the streets.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and headed for the proper crown - Ferguson, again discussed the subject that they had spoken repeatedly before this morning - about the black experience and the living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for his rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening right now is... the culmination that has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time know the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we must do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not experience personal racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd punish him if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florisant, in a place beyond the police station, which had become a certain kind of campsite where the activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who were not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put the bags together and helped them share to the Protestants.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism began to take the shape slowly.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at Missouri-St. At Louis University, he was the President of the Union of minorities Students and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It all just worked out."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a film co-chairman named Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, were just trying to document the events.
The question came up to Ferrelli's head: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was caused by countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to cut it off from pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already begun his hands with co-chair Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activism in connection with deceased prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and six other locals who were watching the movie "Whose Streets" after Brown was shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were pictured, because that's how they picture me."
Although it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was possible to show that the movement is not a "cleaner guide, but a community gathering", as Folayan said, he was the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is surprisingly documenting personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage with his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the lina.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, the Ferrelli story highlights and reassigns the central role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought in social media in 2012 after the killing of the black teen Trayvon Martin, the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"In the leading role of the black homosexual women have maintained the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is because we have to fight on a constant number of fronts.
Black-skinded homosexual women have to carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is truly preserved by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "no way of creating equal opportunities" - Ferrelli did not choose to be the center point of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who blew the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was located directly on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living in such knots there is a lot of weight.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have long gone from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
During Ferrell's demonstration, the conditionality for blocking the road will last for 2,5 years.
He describes the social policy in the area he calls home, just "shoulderbohu."
Yet, he still considers the mantra he has embedded the memory since he went to Ferguson streets three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tips to get over the Week's party after the pohmel
Some mightier men find that, after a napshot party, that, of which trouble, that helps.
Or they're based on the saying "out of pom, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent phenomenon for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's trall or other party and to get through the pohmal as painfully as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid while drinking alcohol, it has to be returned somehow.
With the water, minerals are also being washed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach has often been irritated since the drink, it is especially good if it is vacuum-free or only lightly gased.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost you to go to my grandmother's house to break trees - it could be a fateful false decision.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive.
Landing in the tent and laying out of the bushes is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you're already throwing up last night, it's definitely not worth trying to load a big fat paddle.
For example, start with fresh juice containing fruit sugars that are found in your body to be quietly marketed.
If the health of the southern place is already suffering, you could try the broth, for example.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent the bangle tonight, your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and so loses performance.
So you're ruining your liver even more, and then there's a lot worse in the future.
In addition, painkiller is not in the body for a long time anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach, it'll piss you off as much as the stainy stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll be fine with yourself.
It affects about the same way as walking, but walking can't get an orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and crazier posing during the time of the posing should be moderate in physical effort.
You gotta be kidding me.
Tell your friends and associates a fool, make simple foolishness and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others.
A joke and a laugh may not get off the bushes, but I'm sure it's a lot more fun to take after them.
One time, the bucket's going to pass anyway!
The professor of Northwestern and Oxford University employees are being searched for suspects in murder.
According to the police, the professor of the University of Northwestern and the University of Oxford are being searched for suspects after finding a deadly stabbing man's body in one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to Cook County court documents, no warrants for bail were issued on Monday for arrests of Wyndham Lathem, 42 years old, and Andrew Warren 56 years old, accused of the murder of the first degree because of their alleged connection to Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The cops got a phone call and found a victim in Grand Plaza's apartment when they arrived, whose body had multiple stab wounds.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was recognized dead and investigators were involved in stabbing as a murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Vice-President of Public Relations at the University Alan K. Cubbage said in the e-written statement that Lathem has now been temporarily withdrawn from work and has been prohibited to enter the urban offices of the University of Northwestern.
"It is now the case of criminal investigations by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is an elder in the financial department of the University of Oxford.
In an e-written statement from the University and Somerville College: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research institutes in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself out.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department Communications, urges suspects to give up themselves to the authorities.
"The police have a clue where they are, but we are working on defining the exact location more and more," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, suspects are helped by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a cryptical clue that there was something going on in the apartment No. 1008.
According to the police descriptions, it was a vicious sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Plaza Governor sent a letter to the people: "The police are currently working to clarify the history of the events and the history of the victims and examines various motives, including the possibility that it was a family ridge."
Idu firms that help your company to avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in his e-commerce start company, but the surveys were profitless.
The answers were often unclear, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed selling hair maintenance products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he invited outsiders to help.
There are new types of human resources start-ups that help companies to identify what their employees feel.
In developing and licensing software that is determined to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints on a hot line and, in some cases, allow their language holders to pass through C-level leaders and turn directly to the Board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-operator and executive manager of Redwood City, Glint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Erretti, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel for three years when he has used Glint.
In addition to the surveys carried out by the sudden investigations and specific teams, it provides a company's heating map, which provides an overview of the most complaints in which departments and which drivers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have started to understand that they have to remain familiar with their work culture so that they do not become the next Uber, who has been rebelled into scandals since the former employee published a blog mailing that described an awkward environment in which the people who were brave to speak were punished.
For start-up companies such as Glint, the desire for an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and conformity may be worth more than USD 118.7 billion in the Let's Talk Payments website by 2020.
In Denver, Colorado, a start-up company in Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour, observed this year in the background of Uber's suspicious reputation in the background of interest and activity growth.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
As with Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat cards in problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous communication line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the Executive Director is concerned, the complaints will go straight to the Board.
"The opinion is announced by regulatory authorities," said Convercent's founder and Managing Director Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees inappropriately or acts unethically, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boikots, dismissals and cases, even if regulators do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters.
When an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address at the headquarters of the company, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a discomfort and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which have not reached the leaders previously who operated in other cities or offices located in State States, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after Arthur Andersen's audit firm collapsed due to ethical violations in relation to Enron's scandal.
But only when "social media became mature", companies realized that they could not prevent their black washing publicly online.
"For example, before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity for the approval of venture capital investors, which has been supported by both start-up companies.
Convercent financed $10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing its capital worth of USD 47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing its total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise if they take into account the link between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More studies show that workers today expect more than before from their workplace.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the contributions on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time on a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are listened and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President of the Department of General Benefits and Workers' Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn revenues when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow workers to increase their commitment and inclusion, there is no wonder they will find support.
The involvement of workers is important, according to the professionals of the work culture.
However, these data are useless if company supervisors do not do anything with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will be expected.
And if the changes do not take place fast enough or at all, this may lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4000 interviews," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying on too much data collection.
"Because if you don't finish things, the employees will think, "Did you actually take me to hear?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why would I care?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed workers at the speed and quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to address the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collect new data on workers and it is expected that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, known as its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you'll lose companies."
The euro area’s bright star is the Baltic: income is rising rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes to the European Central Bank report.
According to the central bank, the total production of the economy per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
The success is a low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and a business- and free market-friendly policy.
"Balt countries with Slovakia are among few euro area countries where the real GDP per capita has been significantly closer to the EU average", the Central Bank announced.
Although the objective is to ensure that the total production of the economy per capita is equal to the richer Western Europe, the total production of the Baltic economies per capita in 2015 was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries which were members of the European Union before the enlargement cycle in 2004.
Low wages have led the Baltians to find better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies are doing very well or more well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was thought of a little less than half of the surveyed countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel the practice twice daily makes Bruins' days longer
It is almost 23 o'clock when the trobie of UCLA football players stops talking to the new gym in the university.
Some of them have chopped off a shirt by exposing the sweating back of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these teams offer noon breaks.
After three hours of training, the players in summer courses will go back to study for final examinations before returning to Wasserman's football centre next morning at 6:30 a.m..
"The next three days are a real trial for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora a little before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the exercises of players twice a day, has actually made their days longer - at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
For this reason, the first three trainings of UCLA were scheduled to start at 19.15 in order to suit players to a close schedule.
Transition from two training days means more than one workout days - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised in comparison to the previous season almost a week's period ahead and for the first time during the Mora six Westwood seasons during summer courses.
They have 18 exercises until 20 August before the formal preparation for the opening of Texas A&M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA change of the rule, although it adds another agenda item to the close schedules of the players.
"They have a tremendous burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break themselves through this trial; they will harden, they are fine young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really nice."
Once the camp is finished, the UCLA training will be closed, which is not quite a simple task, taking into account a clear view of these squares from the nearest parking site and the nearest Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by footballes that have already escaped from the gatepost's protective network.
Since this weekend, the players of the hotel Bruins are occupied, but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We are building security measures," said Mora.
"It's a real concern, and it's not too overly exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a recording of training, you can make a pretty good deal.
But we're using security teams on the parking lot and eight.
We make our best by using the existing.
I'm trying not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
For revenge, the Savi Saar-Ivanova Electoral Alliance, the Reformiers' Electoral Alliance of Our Tallinn and Participants, which was created to join the forces of Maria Kaljuste, who were forced to leave Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE from the Reformiers, appears to be as many of the political elections in this year.
But the chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the Edgar Savi Island support group has declined to a small age, the events that have been organised for his election union may nevertheless be honoured.
One member of the Riigikogu, some of the former and current central groups and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the Electoral Union?
And is there any reason why some of the faithful followers and friends of the Savi saare are deterrenced from candidateship in Tallinn, that the list of the proprietors of the Savi saare, whose front end is corruptionists and suspected of corruption crimes, being found to be real?
The music video filmed at the City Department's roof to the Russian pop song in which Lasnamäe's town is older; and, in every sense, a sublime computer game, where Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the votes of 16- and 17-year-old electorals for the first time.
We will wait for the idea of other political parties in a youth-like election campaign.
If the viewers of Channel 2 or TV3 are viewed by a black square from the beginning of August instead of entertainment broadcasts, there are two choices: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 will be able to deliver a tenth of each month to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who enjoy publicly the public experience of advertising-free telecoms at first, but at the end of the year, although they are reluctantly paying for TV and advertising.
The music, the noiseful people and the garbage left on the streets is almost unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don't want to get part of the melody, it's worth going home and leaving a place to sleep for a luxurious sum for the festival villages instead of paining your head.
Washington changes the green card rules.
The media publications quote President Donald Trump, who says there is a new U.S. immigration plan to change the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, more stringent rules for obtaining temporary working methods and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to the congress in two Chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way in which green cards are issued to citizens of other countries in the United States.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, the U.S. press releases.
Siberian seto young people move into town, pensioners back to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto of gold miners along the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometers away from home as a driver in a gold artelli, near the Earth River.
It's a rough job: two months a week without the holidays for 12 hours and then only ten days at home and again.
During the three years of Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There is a tough time: when you go in, you're thoroughly checking that you don't bring the vodka, and going out to not take the gold," says Anatol.
Mare Piho was talking to the village of Haida with local seto Jaan, who has told her a lot about her family memories in Siberia.
The archaeological culture of Siberian setoes will also affect home-setos, because it is just so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly remote setos researched by Piho Mare.
His first exploration to Siberia takes 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many sets did they still travel to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century to gain land here?
That's an unresolved question.
I'm saying 8000.
I counted it out by Siberian seto men's stories, who's thought about it.
It's hard to say exactly because there may have been up to 30 people in one group, but the passport was only given to a man.
The pass was only given to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times bigger than the history of Setoma.
I mean, it had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as farmers, but they changed their lives because here they entered areas not only related to agriculture but also to the river (palk farming), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petser, many of the sets later went to work in a classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (it was built by the Soviet power of uranium excavation plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets then form a majority of the population in this area?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition remained a long time to get married and a multichildren.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How different was the culture of Siberian setos and different from the setos of the motherland?
They're different, although what they brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of people's clothes.
They then did themselves (Grades), but they always did the difference that was brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the setos, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just sprinkled.
Where are the villages of Siberian setos and what lives there are? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The relationship with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto Delegation who came to visit Haida on the day of the Kingdom of Seto at the beginning of July and lived four days in the homes - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"Take it easy to come and go, too, because the city has a great location: railway intersection point and road crossing point," says Reigo Tamm, the opera opera-south from Kill.
The city is no longer a military leader, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultures, and the pizza is available in every corner.
Kill is a top-top town!
There's a small island across the city along the White River, where the slaughterers practice to have a Japanese party.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo is.
Whoever does not fear cold water can swim in that river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can keep a picnic on the river and just make romance - you can see the river flow and think about life in front and back.
I've been walking with my bridesmaids there too.
The Operian Tamm has been on the riverside except for the rest of it, practicing his treasures between the three bridges: "Because this place is near the city, no one may come back if their stories are cramped."
"A wonderful view of the Mansion Mountain is open to the Tapa, but there are also health tracks where you can run, winter ski and now, for example, discgolf play - golf track is made, disks can be borrowed from the sports center", runs Reigo.
The old pros are there, of course, with their disks, but I haven't made it yet.
It is probably necessary to invite Mr Rasmus Kull to visit the Kill because he has experienced a discgolf player and he has disks.
That's how he's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männik Mountain were inseparable of the childhood of the present opera-solist.
At least during oral hours.
There's been a lot of tears, disappointments, and you win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleeves and shoes.
"The entire city is now full of construction works, everything changes to unknown," Reigo congratulates.
But the kill of the old and tired vaccination building is a very attractive place where summer responses are played.
I am pleased that in 2012, Mart Meos, the leader of R.A.A.A.A.A.M., accepted my idea and came to the theatre with his theater to make a summer theater.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" just ended, on 11 August, the railway station is "Electure" when the old vacant building is moving around in the 1980s.
"After August 11-13, the days of the City of Kill, where the vacant building has awaken open home cafés and there are various cultural events, including the public races," Reigo recommends to visit the city of 91 in those days.
In a small yellow house on the wooden road of May 1, the museum is already in 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and the information is enormous," praises Reigo, which is full of the history of the City of Kill, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo tells me that when Killl visits all the recommended places, it's going to be empty for a long time, but fortunately, there's a small town full of coffee.
"We have so good places to eat and sometimes when we sit in cafes, you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
The educated and young Death soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so sitting there is an odd feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international association around you.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Warriors, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camped people in the peninsula of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is happening.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already introducing tough fines for all who remain in a place of rest that is not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Kids teach wolves go to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have to give wolves the "training material" of their herd again after the year - probably puppies taught wolves have already broken a number of sheep.
In this year, wolves in the region of Hiiu have broken sheep on three occasions, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
The bubble was only three, a year earlier 124.
In the fractured synchrony, the environmental agency also has data that the soil Hiiumaal wolf was not born and the Hiiumaa hunting council information that this year two wolves have been fixed on the island.
On Monday night, wolves in Emmaste’s municipality broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
On Wednesday early morning, wolves broke a sheep in Reheselian village in the pasture and severely injured you who had to be killed.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent to the Coordination Circle a draft legislation on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and a draft amending plant protection law.
The amendment of the law will abandon the establishment of a separate database for both the locations of the genetically modified crops (GM) and for the operators, which will continue to be used in the plant health register.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in honey in the intended radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently cultivated in Estonia, we consider that there are clear rules to coexist genetically modified and unmodified crops.
This is at least until it has decided not to declare the GMO free of Estonia", said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden of both the private and public sectors", added the mouth.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection of sites and operators of GM crops and the training of operators in GMOVS, laying down requirements for the management of GM crops and the start of economic activity.
In particular with regard to honey, the obligation of the farmer of GM crops to inform the honeys of the start of the farming of GM crops shall be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with honey before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if you wish.
The proposed changes will, in particular, affect the persons, bees and the Farm Office in the field of plant production.
In the European Union, including Estonia, there is only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, none of the Estonian farmers are interested in growing GM crops.
The reason is that there is no corn damager in Estonia, a European stalker for which MON 810 is resistant.
The variety of this corn line is also developed for southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has ordered studies with possible GM organisms to detect contamination in the seeds of various suviraps, maize and soy species grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples taken showed that the seed did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, maize and soy varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia, genetically modified crops are not known and have also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu as a genius after the middle field player against Sampdoro on Wednesday night made his debut.
For 40 million pounds, the player who bought over from Chelsea started in the last seasonal game of United in Dublin before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 winnings, making an impression on the defence role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on assaults.
But having missed Blues' seasonal Asian Tour, Maticul was in need of a hardly needed model, and he only endured 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, it must be corrected before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genius thinking - he has a football entertainment," said Mourinho.
"We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to set up his other early men for the season quietly.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done the "great work" by signing contracts with three of its four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they could realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do the work of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another sausage son got to the foot of the GSM sender on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in the fingers, the first son of the hatchet was born in Sõrves with the escort, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and has joined the large number of nightscapes of the Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because Sõrves isn't a crop, the Sound of the islands is written.
On Tuesday, relatively late for the ringing of the cucumbers, another son of the escort and one on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A boy named Mati GSM sent to Sõrves Türjul was equipped with the bullfight.
"The work of him is on the Internet, everyone is watching: how he went to Spain to winter, coming back to Germany and Poland for a while, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor put a microchip in his body to get into the house and car.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which a microchip was installed so that he could only open his front, get to the office and even start the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip installed between his thumb and name fingers and now offers this service through its company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined the forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Royal Hospital of Hampshire County in Winchester Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure is compatible with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip installed on cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam also switches the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for a lock of 300 pounds.
This married father of a child has installed technology now both home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Exponator paid thousands to taxpayers
According to the military documents published in the magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy Helicopter last month was to pay the taxpayers in the southern yard for the American production event.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One on board during the president's flight, was the central draw number of the events that introduced American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, renewed industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was presented together with a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a coupling support made in Mississippi.
According to the documents responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the escater Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) required the attendance of the White House's military office with the helicopter, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the southern yard for the event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-responsive event," said commander HMX-1 in e-mail the day before the event to your commander, a submarine officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter will arrive at the southern yard at 7 a.m. in the morning of July 17th at 15 a.m. until the courtyard is cleaned between 18 and 21 a.m. on the same night.
It was added that if leaving the White House should be staying, the second ekipage due to the restrictions on working time will need a return flight.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the escader security team remained close to the aircraft throughout the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the magazine whether or not the other equipage finally needed.
The Hatch Law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 has investigated whether this event could be infringed.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and they told us not to violate," wrote the commander.
"It seems you don't have a choice," answered the deputy officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" for an official event, and the Hatch Law would not cover it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed at the senate at that time and commended the efforts to maintain government regulations.
The name Marine One or Air Force One is known as the use of the aircraft for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photo session is unusual.
Trump was noticed in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne in Florida took the background of a presidential plane, and his Twitter account was rumbling from messages that complain about the use of his predecessor's president's plane.
"Valgel House is very pleased with the presentation "in America" where the products were represented from all 50 states which have been made of American materials by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, the White House Press Officer.
HMX-1 teams often take a test flight around Washington and southern yard to train the White House of the President of the United States with a centimetre acceleration.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 at the White House held 58 probations.
According to the officials, the flight was considered as part of the standard of the flight flights of the Air Force in America that month.
The eskader helicopters flew that day for 11 more hours for non-presidency support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other candidates for this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of exhibits on the southern yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 will not maintain the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event will be difficult to identify.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's annual hourly prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The Eskader documents indicated the length of the flight from its main base to the Quantico Navy Airport at both directions of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below that amount.
"The calculation of the costs of the payers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"The estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocable costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence does not cover staff costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former White House Press Officer, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the event at that time.
"The idea is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It's not clear whether Trump was touched in the southern yard in the course of the event by circulating the helicopter, but he sat behind the fire truck steering.
In the White House, Trump turned to the representatives of Sikorsky, throwing jokes about company products in his own aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m ran a foot ramp, and the stadium was taken away with a pie with a candle.
Just before that, he had received zero in the distance jump in the universe held in China.
In 2012, Helsinki EM infringed the injuries in the cheap, but at the debutolympies held in London, he received a position of 6013 points 23.
Still, bad luck continued.
On the 2013 Moscow MM, after the opening day, the Estonian record was scheduled for the distance of the Estonian archipelago.
Two years later, he received position 15 at Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic Standard, but this was more than disappointing the athlete.
The hardest catalyst was not passed by Šadeiko until the result was not received from the Amsterdam EM in the distance jump.
I'd just like to put together a decent multicompetition once.
One time," she confessed.
The worse one was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted because of the thighs in Rio.
It's time to take off, is it going on with seven races?
Is two days of effort still worth all of this?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to cure and think clean.
"I knew I wasn't gonna put the pills in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean page and move on again.
According to coach Anne Mäg, it was very difficult to watch the suffering under care, but he realized that the athlete must, in particular, be made clear.
He was so devastated by all of them.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mountain.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll do it for his own good.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 points at the Götzis multi-competition.
During a high-level competition, he improved the personal high-speed bullet drill by about metres (13.89) and ran in a record-time barrier.
Then the multicompetitor felt that it wasn't the ceiling of power, but it was only the first star of competition.
The mountain instructed for his years says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete. He's good to train.
If something's going to be wrong, or it's wrong, he's gonna say it right now.
He knows his body and trusts his knowledge.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and follow it.
The new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.

One alcohol that drinks is equal to "training" in the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neurological scientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the process of "very active" wine taste.
By sniffing the glass, rotating in the mouth of wine, enjoying it and feeling after taste, we make our brain work to make wine taste.
According to Sheperd, the wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the colors of the brain.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine flavor," says Sheperd.
Things that affect the formation of wine are, for example, our age, our sex and even the number of spits that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, warns that wine isn't to be drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you're taking too big a leash, the system's overdrive.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain instead of benefiting from the brain - people who drink more than three glasses of wine, with memory loss, loss of balance, and with reduced spiritual capacity, according to the 2004 survey.

According to the United Nations, the role of women in politics in the Afghan democracy depends on:
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN Afghan mission said that elections can represent the people only if all members of the society, including women, play a role in them.
Mr Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Aid Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidate for local Soviet elections, three women are candidate for vice-presidents and more than 30 percent of recently registered electorates are women.
"The emphasis on the importance of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in the statement of Wednesday.
The elections can really represent and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the election process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local Soviet Councils in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened on its own the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year's elections celebrate the first time that the power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, the strong role of women in democracy will increase progress in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Electoral Committee, 3,6 million women are registered with 1.2 million voters.

The common time is always too little, but the exercise with the sponge gives a good opportunity to connect together, the game, the proximity and the load.
And what a comfortable solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, the living gloves will always be with you and remind you of your tiny noise, "We'll work out now too!"
Start with warming - very good is the usual golden game or along the beach strip.
The mountain is a platform for stretching legs and ash - who would then like to take the shape of a sandcake that was shredded from the waves during the summer?
Wonderful is to use children instead of the cangie!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the trainer's power.
The progressive can also make a real big deal with the kids.
The child trains balance, reads repeats, and feels good about the opportunity to twist and be important.
At the same time, older children can make themselves a fight.
The extent of the movement sets place by touching the earth and stretching the hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the miniabel to hold them properly.
The child can read repeats and feel like a coach.
Plank is extremely useful, but for the child, hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game Plank: Take a long plank column from which you can run through.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to do when you can hand a friend in the meantime.
To add the load, you can stay in the plank, the tiny place, and you can walk around in this position.

Make sure your back stays in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun to do with a pair and a clap.

All children's favorite and big fun!
At the same time, the parent is truly effective throughout the body's exercise.

From the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, or a Balcony trip to the Mophens
The sacks of shoulders are a summer class, which has become a separate hit product in recent years, which must hang at the top of the hand on one right souvenir and which traders have been able to weld the price label appropriate for the hit.
A bag of shoulder is probably one of the things that have existed once in a lifetime and which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags have made a real race, and the movies have changed their fine design bags for the summer months, instead, for simple shoulders to poured bags.
It's not just a beach bag, but it's as popular as a street bag as well as a brave woman walks into the office.
However, it should be made clear before you see whether a summer look like this is still sitting or paying for a wet computer and a little more officially pushed into a sumadan.
The richness of the shoulder bags has made a woman’s true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing is that the moulds are towed to the local market as the first thing in the holiday trip, and to buy some shoulder bags to which the rest of the holiday is to be true, and which goes along with the beach, the market, and also with friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that among the readers the demand for bags is so high that women (and men!) in the real world are probably being held on each other to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some respects, this madness is also understandable, because these are rare times when some things that have risen into the castle in the fashion world can be bought for just a few ten euros.
True, clever traders have also discovered a simple access to money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for some hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably still to make richer clients feel dead, promoting themselves with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros of shoulder bags.
However, the interpretation of the Chanel’s shoulder bag can amount to EUR 6000.
Unlike most of the molds, shoulder bags are not from some of the great fashions, but their story began farther.
It is said that shoulder bags originate from far from the Philippines, from where they are widely carried.
The blushing of the shoulders is primarily an exporary and the local ones who are walking around them are not seen very often.
It is allegedly from the 14th century shoulder driping technique and is quite vulnerable with normal basket dusting.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be so strong as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded into them that make the bag more personal and more active.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with bruised colored bands or leather strips.
Thanksgiving bags may, in particular, belt bags, send an actor to Jane Birkin, who had never been seen before by the biggest twisted shoulder bag.
He specifically suited the shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing sets and didn't think much of it to even go to the Cannes movie festival.
At the popularity of the bags today, it is not a minor role, but also the fact that care for them is a cushionhead and, unlike any other sumadan, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also the water and wet towel.
As in the case of trends, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretation after classical appearance.
For example, if you want to, you can buy yourself a ribbon of shoulders or a tiny shoulder.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but it does.
But, what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of shoulders, which reminds of their style of baskets, has been considered classical, is open and short, as well as shoulders, sangs.

GMB is concerned about investments in the McVitie's Glasgow factory
The Agency expects a confirmation from the directors of the cookie manufacturer McVitie on long-term production plans in the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the investment of the Tollcross object on the future.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces cookies for Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products.
The owner of McVitie's Pladis said they've invested the object in the last few years with over 5 million pounds.
There were employees and Chairpersons of the trade union "be the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
By letter to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie’s request to "resolve concerns regarding the fact that the funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot be clear from the head of the object regarding the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families working here, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and of the people of the Glasgow region, being essential in order to ensure more well-efficient employment in the area where there is high unemployment and social deficiency.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a company with high productivity growth in McVitie in the light of jobs, wages and wellbeing in the eastern part, and Brexit, the increase in the cost of living and the chronic decline of production."
The representative of the Pladis said: "The Target Manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to it because we appreciate active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we are examining our activities - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested the Tollcross object more than £5 million, most of it has gone into production lines and operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as the heritage of the production object and if any change in the activity of the object occurs, the employees and representatives of the trade union are the first to hear it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up attempts to attract Neymar into its lines by offering 189 million pounds to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this recording trip?
This smooth approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the present world record of overpurchase, which was set up in the previous season by the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
After the transition has been completed, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete who will receive over 500 000 pounds per week from the PSG after payment.
Barcelona is known to be angry as a result of both the approach and the break-off of Neymar, although the source close to the Catalans Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser warned against the karm of all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll meet them and contact these players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border because the Spanish club previously showed interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratt this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona would be able to receive a rebound as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a rope between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar at his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to the asset locker, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not possible, to remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
Another opportunity to make UK absent would be the creation of the European Union and the United Kingdom Customs Union, explained by the Prime Minister of Ireland.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could have this kind of agreement with Britain."
Alternatively, it would be a return to customs posts that would declare historic division and political failure.
"Trust to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its result could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met Belfast by visiting the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
His first half-long triatlon has passed March Avandi: Ironman is able to pass everyone.
Today, in the winter capital of Otepää, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held when half-long Ironman’s competitions took place about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triatlon of his life also ended Mart Avandi.
"I thought it would be complicated and it was finally complicated," said Avandi in the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi realized that, in fact, triatlon is a powerful head for everyone.
"Not the distance kills, but the pace kills," he said, saying that with a strong pace, everyone gets to the finish.
Except Ott Sepp: "Once the physical system, it's okay, but he doesn't know how to swim."
The Avandi had been working hard since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, but later ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached 270 in general account.
Although the Avandi lost both Raio to the Rajoja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won others in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, a good example of the person, lost Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times according to 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the Otepää stage men of the Ironman series was crowned by John Moldan at 3:58:27, the Estonians were the best Ivo in the Great Time at 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danube Helle Frederiksen won at 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Rabbi, who lost Frederiks in nearly half an hour and became at 04:58:58.
The opening went through a 1,9 km long swimway in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at position 410.
