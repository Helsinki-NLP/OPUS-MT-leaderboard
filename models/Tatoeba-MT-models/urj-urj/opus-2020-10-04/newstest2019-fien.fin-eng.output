Emili Kouki led Hurricane's home profit in the opening of Savo Volley's second victory.
Following seven times a succession in the men's balloon Championship medals of Hurricane Loimaa started the season 2018-19 at home victory when the Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Emeli Kouki, the returning player from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective Hurricane.
There were some insults abroad, but they were not realised, and then the call came from Loma.
It was pretty fast that we had a deal, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen also played in Loimus at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the match-by-measure country planner Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the medal pipe is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley when the team fell by the Viere Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was stubborn, especially in the head of the attack, but fortunately we got a squeezed victory.
At least I didn't have any information about a different download when I was playing against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3-series, made 12 points in the Aerial Ball next to the 2000-01 series.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small, or atmosphere on the roof all the time.
The good fiilis was left in the house opening.
Miro was a king. He played a good game, too.
The last season in the league was 2006-07, and then he won silver in the Sammo of Pielave, while Tuovise was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective 14 points in Ducks.
Mikkonen again, the star of Aka-Volley
During the period 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league point exchange, has also started this season vigorously.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening win after the Kokkolan Tigers 3-2 fell.
The season has begun very well on its own.
Today, of course, the loss was close, because we had one fourth of the 17-21 losses.
We've been digging a victory somewhere, and the fifth set came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few months ago still in the final matches of Tigers the most effective was 28 points made by hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
I didn't get much on the guy's hacker, Mikkonen praised.
In comparison with human capital, Finland is the world's number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland.
Later, Holland was located on one higher and instead of Canada, it was found on the list in Taiwan.
In 2016, the worst comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population will be examined.
The World Bank has set human capital links with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, the local game ended as a painting.
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled into the glorious fights, and the local game of Madrid teams ended up in a fictionless match late Saturday in the Spanish football League.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played atletico through three times when he was a Chelsea player.
In the first week, Fifa, the International League of Football, selected him for the year's goalkeeper.
In the real world, the best goal place was given to Gareth Bale, but his shot was headed over at the end of the opening half of the goal.
After a break, Bale was switched for a thigh injury.
According to the ESPN, the disappointed Realists screamed in the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo.
The United States is now attacking the right to abortion - a powerful document tells us why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by Mr Donald Trump's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that, by the decisive vote, Kavanaugh could be revoked by a decision known as Roe against Wade, which made an abortion in the US in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various support from the majority of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of a powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left as the only doctor who has aborted in the state of Missour.
The armed guard of the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind you of the killing terrorist attacks that have been done to the clinics.
Let's move on at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran churchmen's association guided women to adherence to abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but they don't even need them, a photo of the woman who died for abortion.
Death in the United States was about 5,000 a year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Even in California in 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion law.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, started to confuse religion with political constituent.
His abortion stock also twisted his successor, George Bush's parents.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
To the deepest core of the matter, a documentary documented at the top of the search for the basis for the politicalisation of abortion.
When tax exemption was banned from religious organisations that benefited from racial separation, they became politically active.
They picked an abortion for a boob horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
When writing this in the United States, there is a situation in which the President, who has captured the voices of religious right, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can have a vast power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, on the border of great demonstrations.
Approximately 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the 12 and 14-year-olds.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
These are the 89 bullets that were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened the fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the demonstrators threw the troops of Israel with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has started the use of force to prevent demonstrators from breaking down the border or attempting to move on to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in demonstrations in Gaza since March, when the Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12 000 are wounded.
The demonstrators demanded access to the Palestinian families, from which the Palestinian people had to leave when the Israeli state was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
The explosives detonated by lions and helium balls from the Palestinian side have lit forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
The fact is, Santa's got a hit of punishment, and he couldn't shoot himself.
The top pair of Wigan, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have knocked him down in the penitentiary area behind him.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to go on.
According to his interpretation, the tactic was clean.
Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation stayed to bother Judge Ward, who convicted Norwich for the fivety-five minutes after Santa fell.
Ward showed me a glimpse of punishment, and Mario Vrancic squeezed a 1-0 winning painting.
Santa's done five paints for Norwich in the Championship.
Last Saturday, the last one was born with a stylish breast muscle against QPR.
Working tasted for Puk again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended without tiredness.
The fight for Norwich was five in two weeks.
The team continues in the liigacup.
There's five winning tubes behind.
Auxiliary Pedophile Service was immediately completed by reservations - in Finland about 40,000 experiments with children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small number of women experience at least some sexual interest in premier ages.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Children or young people who are sexually interested have so far been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Assistance Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in spring, the Sexpo, which provides counselling and therapy, started an e-mail e-mail and the meeting hours were very quickly completed, Yle reports.
These are promised, however, in autumn of liberation.
Sexual preference for children causes many shame.
Most of the pedophilic emotions in themselves have not performed their fantasies and thus did no criminal.
However, satisfaction is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that trouble them and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Ylelle sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
I think it's worth the job if a child saves sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The Korean leaders or the Congoan Gynecologist?
The United States President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the prize.
The background is Trump's role in obtaining North Korea, at least at speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The largest favourites for peace to be received by Nobel are the coincidences of the South Korean President Moon Jae and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-u, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the rings is significant, because the gaps were good last year.
Yet, for years, the reward of Kim, which leads to nuclear threats and land with iron extract, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The beneficiaries of Nobel Prizes will be made public since Monday, and on Friday it will be the most remarkable, i.e. peace prize.
If a prize is not awarded to those involved in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congo doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the valued gynecologist has taken care of thousands of women who were victims of mass destruction and have become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there are 331 candidates to receive the prize.
The names of candidates will not be reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel could.
In May, the journalist asked him at the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said smiling.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee on Prize has often given recognition to people and organisations representing liberal democracy and the multi-state world order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have received the prize, all of which have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require a ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire declaration in tunnel: Drivers acted like soups and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred on September 8th took place on the 1st Dragon.
As a result of the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out it was a system failure, the fire department sought to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road with a silk shock and they're driving how it hurts, the vigilante fireman Pasi Kääriainen told STT that she was fresh at that time.
At that time, the motorway was left even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the rules of transport, a few others are often followed, the contact manager of traffic security Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
According to transport rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for forced reasons.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, transport can not be jeopardised by emerging solutions.
The alarm vehicles shall always provide as unacceptable as possible.
In the opposite direction, driving on the motorway is in particular prohibited, as well as making and withdrawing the U translation.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlamps must always be switched on.
Even stopping without compulsive cause is prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
In recent cases, even the driver has stopped at the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Communication.
Ilves would have wanted to continue their party even if the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake.
Inland waterway ship M/S The Ilves fans transported in Tampere would have wanted to stay on board to continue the victory party, even though the ship had been caught on the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the leader of the ship at the time of the event.
The M/S Tampere, travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, took off the road late Saturday night and stuck on the bottom of his bow in Vanajavede in Aka.
19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was injured.
Ilves would have wanted to continue their party in the ship until morning, but, of course, it was more reasonable to send them to the fire department on a ride to the port and home by the bus, said Syrjä to STT.
Ilves had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK fight, which ended with the 4-3 wins of Ilves.
According to the margin, Saturday's friend was due to the fact that the surface of the water on the Old Yave was about a half-metre lower than normal.
According to Syrje, the fact that the nearest track mark was covered by the blocks of the trailers also made it difficult to navigate, as a result of which its reflectors were not normally seen in the dark autumn.
No more collision
Haveri happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalm shortly after the shipping route had undermined the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The higher dramatics of the case were not associated with the Syrjä, as the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground did not result in a more significant collision.
According to the margin, catching on the ground has not caused leakage or pressing on the ship, and with these visions the cruises of the ship will continue normally.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning to check the properness of the ship before the ship was towed off the mattress.
For the sake of certainty, we still go to the dock to check that there was no damage, says Syrjä.
The margin believes that the next cruise busted in M/S Tampere next weekend can be handled in a consensus.
According to him, the ship's cruise season will continue until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility received an alert on Saturday night after a little after twelve.
The violin port was alerted for ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
In the late evening, a modern fireman, Matti Willman, told us that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult for darkness and pretty bad wind.
Pirkanmaa's rescue facility announced half after three on the night before Sunday that all the onboard were evacuated and passengers were transferred to Tampere by bus.
The cruiser built in 1957, has been enriched in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Tribunal of Trump, accused of harassment and drinking, may not be high-level.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain unwilling for the work pursued, evaluated by Mika Aaltola, Director of the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person.
In the United States, in the past, the candidate of the President to judge the Supreme Court has raised a great deal of contradictions.
In this case, the candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
Name would be a hundred for the Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to be brought to the Laar of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming mid-elections of the Congress.
It would raise the vote among young people and women, who are more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term profit for the Republicans.
There is no chance for every presidential period, as the judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70-80 years of age.
Even some of the Republicans hesitate to name
The candidates of the Supreme Court of the United States are normally subject to a background review, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set up a week's deadline for the F.B.I.A.'s further investigation, Aaltola may still bring up something essential.
Yeah, it might be.
rarely there's smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness to the office will be discussed vigorously before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate, with 51-49 votes, but at least two female republicators are considered to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the appointment to be voted and the Republicans would lose.
The woman identified the Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has told BBC that she has identified Salisbury's poisoning as an agent for Russian military intelligence.
According to the photographs, the woman said it was a military intelligence with Anatoli Tshepiga working at GRU.
Net community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they exposed another poisoning of suspected men to Czechia.
Already earlier, they said they found evidence that the current identity of men is covert personalities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near a village in Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman in the village recognized the pictures published by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the pictures of the British police, where Ruslan was a man who called himself Boshiro today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent, Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Novitshok nerve poisoning in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's award mark in 2014.
Russia is still denying the GRU connection of the suspect.
The men suspected of poisoning said that they were tourists in Salisbury at the Russian TV interview earlier in September.
Old people throwing bags in war reform
There is now a living example of what the change limit for the reform of war defined by the Sipila Government in practice means.
My Syntymy Valala war services produce Oulunkaaren municipality, the former Regional Director of Attendo was elected as the head of health services in 2016.
The Heads of the municipality are warning the delegation from the change limiter.
If the cost of war is now rising, the state aid will be cut in the future.
The central heads of the municipality are terrified, and most of them are prepared for a major structural change in the care of old people, which would stop the institutional care of the health centre in bed department and the small memorabilia.
House sickness treatment would be increased, which means the long distances in the White of long distances that older people living in the outskirts are stripped from the roots of the health centre to take care of the home.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay it to customers.
The left side of the election did not undermine poor preparation, but organised a good public meeting with many family, closest spouses and also with other parties.
I presented the Sote County Preparatory Work on how old people are already being treated in the Valala municipality at home at the most at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Western councilman was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the opportunity, and it lifted the Oulunkare manufacturers on its back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any papers the fact that Attendo has built a new nursing home in the Vala, which is now waiting for people who are empty.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service banknotes, but do not tell what level of treatment Attendo will receive or with what staff structure will treat old people up to congestion.
Without a nurse?
The locations of the health centre will be terminated because there is no medical nightcare.
Attendo will also be relied on the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the light shows how central officials are running the authorised inadequate information and the authorised will be given back against the wall by means of a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party clears out the people of Valal, for who will remain unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one electoral clause in the centre that the whole country should be kept inhabited?
Turkey's President Erdogan opened a big mosque in Cologne.
In the city of Cologne, Germany, thousands of people showed their view when the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened the biggest European mosque.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the Rhine Beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the demonstrators, and the attack sentences condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, a number of demonstrations have been organised, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were waiting for the streets to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan's supporters were also gathered near the big mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the successful success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it confirmed relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel sworn to rebuild the relations of countries that have deteriorated considerably since the 2016 reign of the Turkish reign.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including human rights issues.
Review is surrounded by visits
Both the Mayor of Köln Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Armin Laschet, renounced their participation in the openings when the evaluation of Erdogan’s visit was accelerated.
The 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he came to the protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, murdered and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of the German journey of Erdogan in Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three prosecutions for the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been prosecuted for the murder of journalist Jan Kucia.
The prosecutor told me on Friday that three people are accused of the pearly murder of Kuciak and this fiancée and other crimes.
Previously on this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected murders related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concern about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
The distribution of the cattle may be problematic on Sunday in the sharks
Due to the error of the print, the Sunday Karjalainen must also be posted without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in decentralised areas where the distribution of joint boxes is required from the outer memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post will put extra press bouquets in the county.
Other Finnish subscribers’ magazines will be sent separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is profoundly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing directly today in his forthcoming debate programme, including Vesa Heilalala.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about his coming space trip, which he reserved for Virgi Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was needed to pay a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been delayed one year.
Now it seems that after the experimental flight, which was unlucky, in 2014, and the death victim, things are going to be messed up.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or at the latest in the next year.
The number of water flights is 300, i.e. his journey is about one year from the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and in the unweighted state will be 5 minutes at 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut will tell you about its future homepage.
At the same address, he also backs up his longing for space.
When I was a child, I read a comic booklet called Space Travel, and I saw the Star Trek series on television.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's the idea...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued its lossless journey in Valioliiga when it fell on Saturday at its homeland with Brighton paintings 2-0.
The power of the Championship of the sixth season is the guaranteed goal injections of Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to control the fourth hit of the season from close to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the back of Brighton's goal 30 minutes.
Agüero lifted his own stock to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling to pieces with 65th game minutes.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 ends of the penitentiary at the point of the penalty ease.
Six winners and one match of the season started by City leads Valioligaa 19 points by catches.
However, the less-played Liverpool is stalking only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his own seventh round in Chelsea.
Youth clubs chose new leaders in Joensuu
At its Sunday meeting, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year period for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected Chairman of Upper Savo and Vice-President of Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
40 actual members and 40 alternates were elected by the Board, Finland's Youth Associations are announced on Sunday.
The youth congregation meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensue will therefore make three promises in its three-year policy objectives: we will keep the doors open to everyone, and we will organise equal recreational activities regardless of the habitat and background, and we will support volunteering and people in their own way of growth, Finland’s Youth Society will report in the course of communication.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "Forgoes a very important driver"
In the interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu's British Kit asked, he believes that the release of Kim Räikköse from Ferrar would help Hamilton in the end of the year.
Hamilton leads the second driver of Ferrar at MM points at 40 points Sebastian Vetti.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't believe that the Räikkönen would hit gloves in the dish.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorite drivers and I'm convinced Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton's told me earlier that Räikkönen has been one of his foreheads.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played F1 with PlayStation all day.
I was always Kim, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian competition.
To the race at 14 p.m., Mercedes' Valter Bottas will go.
The evening magazine's following the race for the moment.
Football A SM championship became a full fart: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top of the football boys ends the serial level on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Prior to the turn from 13 a.m., the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: the FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to get a point against the Left IFK.
In order to turn the situation on the last round, Ilves, secondly in the championship campaign, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the lattes.
However, the Gulf Championship was established practically before the beginning of the booklet, since Vasa IFK had arrived in the Gulf with only seven players.
If there had been one less vase, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the ladders led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Balkans player roof is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-SM series, the P20 series, and the second block of men.
The left IFK has played in the second in practice against the fall of the entire season.
On Saturday, on the second round of decisions, the Left IFK has to win the JBK guest match and hope that Tampere United will lose its own visit to KuFua in the Silill Lake Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof of Eno, according to the rescue department, the luck was involved.
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up in the street of Eno on Sunday at 9:00 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department reported.
Good luck with that. The press release says it.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol went to the scene of an accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways of inquiry: equipment purchases and recruitments already made, non-sweeting operations for foreign planning
According to Antti Pelttar, Supo's commander, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As the law of intelligence enters into force, a permanent increase of EUR 10 million should be made.
In the offices of the Helsinki Ratakadu Defence Police (supon), a complete decision is already being prepared for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Pelttari, Supo's council manager, tells the West Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shaking on a video where he's singing in the topless... campaigning for chest cancer information.
Serena Williams, the Tennis Superstar, will strike again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of the chest, by publishing his Instagram account a video where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The Paragraph is Australian The Divinyls 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports the activities of Australia's breast cancer group.
"I voted the Divinyls global hit to remind women to regularly carry out self-acting [breeds] audits," Williams writes the Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the skin colors around the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it plays a lot of lives.
The second writer of the Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us a hell of a song to remind the women to give priority to his health," Williams says.

The alley of the corpel ends today: this ends all
Everything good ends in good time.
Today, that is what happens to the domestic land drama in the Corpela alley, which has been quite respected.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week, the episode looked at 722 000 Finns as a first presentation on television.
The summits in itself have no practical significance, because the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkise series are not going on.
During the final period with regard to Jaska and Mirku, the aim is to move forward, and I think the mother of Jaska is the first to know what to come.
Even between Anssi and Misa are warm, especially romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho appears again in the patterns.
The police are also in a position to be suspicious about a man.
But none of you know how to figure out the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita's got to hear some amazing news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which will bring a woman’s tears to the edge.

Is it worth working tomorrow in a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of lots of lots of lots stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go intofecting, because the disease can be contagious even if their symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the wings.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says the Prevention publication.
So it's worth staying home?
Prevention says that flu is infected even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected by a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can get back to work when the cough is slowing down and there's no more fever, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
It's too fast to get back to the gym to slow down recovery.
Remember to wash your hands, get your knitting, and throw your stain papers into the garbage.
As a matter of fact, when you're sick, you're going to move?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
And the stunts are also limited to the mask.
Then how can the infections be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missile tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the miss are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The puppies of the Finnish crown of Miss 2018 have received Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
She lives in Lahde now, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an inker and father is a Russian.
The Russian father, Voronkova, was harassed at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was harassed because of my Russianism.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina explains in the publicity of the Semifinalists of Miss Finland.
After high school, Alina decided to start on a clean table and move to Lahte to go to high school.
Soon, the missile lady found new friends, and the ark went to roll like he hoped.
When he was 15, he thinks he's a grown-up, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonah Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
Since the SM-Liiga career, the hockey hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team in the 18-year-old MM races.
In the early days of dating, a couple lived almost a year away, but later, Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner's triangle and, as a result, I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have good trust, and the good part of the distance is that it will remain up to the whole time, Alina reluctant in May.

Sustainable options are being sought for sustained growth, but even the theory of a reasonable economy faces major problems.
During a few generations, economic growth has brought to normal people, especially in the north side of the ball, a standard of living, which used to have only dreams.
However, the long-term crossing of the world's capacity and climate change will cause this market economy to be at risk.

The police have captured one person who is able to find out how much part of the stabbing is possible.
The police are also looking for another suspect in the event.
Events are being investigated as a attempt to kill and a serious assault.

Now they are transferred by bus to Tampere, told Jari Nieminen, the specialist chief, after 1 noon.

According to the rescue facility, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently, the ship doesn't leak.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check out what's at the bottom.

Ex-managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius.
The fight against Erkan Teper, the boxer Robert Helenius's evening, is being spearheaded by the conflict of money.
Night-Sanomat today reported the boxing manager Jaakko Helmis and Vice-Chairman Jussi Kokkila's application for an application for a total amount of managerial fees that Helenius has paid for over 80 000 euros.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to reconcile, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, the Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent the evening magazine in exchange for the events of the boxer's view.
Helenius denys that he is obligatory to pay the amount required.
In response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically indispensable situation to Helenius and promised to be able to organise him matches and sponsor incomes.
In a word, it was agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay only a percentage of its matches.
Once again, it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay for anything but to receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The work has never been agreed and this would have been insane in Helenius' situation, Sundman will find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to its response, Helenius would have liked to agree the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman had only received the draft early at the end of 2014.
On his own hand, he pointed out the proposal and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helm.
Helenius never fought with Kokkila and Helm.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "unidentified but massive" bill from the manager's work.
This year, the same arguments have been raised.
Helenius thinks that afterwards of Helm and Kokkila's activities are poor, and that's the answer.
Helenius meets today at the seventh of the IBF heavy-series challenger list of Erkan Teper in Stuttgart.
A Heart Man and a Good Supplier
Fun artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt a deadly radio drinker and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line radio runner and supplier Erkki Pälli died at 83 years of age with unrepentant liver cancer.
The host's death declaration was published at the Helsinki News on Sunday.
The report says Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, which was mourned by knowledge of a familiar’s fate.
Ile Vainio says he left it on Facebook earlier than he said goodbye.
Persecution considers Erkki Pälli as a multi-sponsored expert, who became a brilliant journalist.
He recalls that Päll was a kept person with fast hoksotts and fun stuff.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finn's plate when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
That's when we met with Erk.
Ile Vainio remembers that when he was a Finnlevy reporter, and he was in different positions.
When I proceeded to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor in all parties making stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got to the skin of his interviews.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
Many of him were known as a highly respected radio runner, but he also wrote brilliant magazine stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was good at talking, the Vainio says.
During the decade, Pälli worked in addition to the supplier's work in Fazer's disc company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work where he had a custom style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became acquainted with numerous listeners at Yle's ether.
The Pälli retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Skiing Union announced that the financial year ended by the Union in May resulted in some EUR 450 000 profits.
The Union describes the experienced "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy, of course, is burdening "the significant debt in the balance sheet".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala commends rapid reaction and strict economic discipline.
We reacted to the situation as soon as possible last autumn, taking adaptation measures.
Operating careful planning and economic management has been struck through our entire organisation, Kulmaala tells us in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement, and in addition, the return on world cubes was the maximum in the past period of competition.
However, the cost management must also continue to be precise and at the same time we must continue looking for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was a silence.

Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many Please residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house is somehow capable, possible afterquakes could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
There were probably about 560 prisoners, so there might be about 300 fugitives.
Also, some of Donggala's prison prisoners have escaped, says The Jakarta Post.

Svetlana is an inkertial and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks a smooth Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than the career of Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio runner.
Only later, Alina was excited about the beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to go to college before she took part in Miss Finland.
This was the case, and finally, Alina wanted to do the course of the candle before the missiles.
We were already asking last year why he wasn't involved, but he wanted to finish the box.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, it's showing up.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and started to be a homemade in Finland - remembered the idea of the cartoon: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The monastery left my husband's revelation, in which he proposed it to the story I developed, reports the espoolan cartoon blogger, the mother of the home and the former EU translator, Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that he was in Brussels as an EU translator for economic and legal matters until after the fourth child, the family became a returner ten years ago.
I've been very enjoyable as a homemade.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point, it came to mind what he would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then 2014 came a cartoon.
Piippo says he never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix since he was a little.
When I was a child, I had drawn, but when these manuscripts of the Beastman began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made some dozen scripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skillful painter, but I couldn't attract her until the summer of 2016, when I donated Vivia with a drawing disc.
His passion lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells me the drawing plate was a great stimulator for him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, tell you Piippo about drawing his relationship, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts keep pops into mind, but I usually don't make it ready at the same time.
One of the three screen stripes will take even more hours.
I might make a screen at once, and I'm happy to play with the colors.
Start drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the modern series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The natural man is a carrot-footed mother with a salad hair belt in the L themes.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of the wild beast, man is what he eats.
The ideas of a series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a compulsive ball, even though Luomuhuppä invades it.
The Piippo tells us that he's reading his series with his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon that you're looking at, and you're telling me that I've done this today.
And there's a lot of challenges for my mother!

In Indonesia's earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself did not leave the cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old airline leader, has become a hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung stayed alone in the flight control tower until hundreds of passengers were safely escorted from the groundquake on the island.
The young man was in charge of the City of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport when the earthquake hit on Friday.
When others fled from the flight tower, Agung refused to leave his place before he was able to steer Batik Air's passenger plane off the airline.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, and the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after earthquake.
The airline tower sparkled and broke.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he was severely injured.
Agung was banished to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported to a better equipped facility with a helicopter, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the airline representative told the Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to increase when the flight was airborne, and its strength was finally measured by 7.5 magnets.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected the heroism of Agung in social media.
Rehn considered the end of Europe in the trade war: "We should look at the next twit"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Olli Rehn, President-in-Office, said at Yle's first check that, although the tension in the tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which, in turn, reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is so far very good for leisure.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be floating into the legs of the trade war.
We'll have to look at the next twitter and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner on the road of Washington, but he said at the interview with Yle.
There are also own risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Last night, the market reacted vigorously to a clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of national production.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan ratio is problem credits and the unorganized loans account for more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public finances are in weaknesses, and the country seems to regain its commitment in relation to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises yet, and Rehn answered when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn was hoping it would be settled.
A sufficient distinction would have a much more negative impact.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will retire in a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikase's name have been sloppy in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if there are Finnish names involved, and Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on this further.
The HS's superfavoured Black box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black box presentations organised by the Helsingin Sanoms will continue again in the beginning week.
The other presentations will be presented at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23, the Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere presentation has been sold out.
Tickets will sell the flag.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers report a long story that they have prepared, which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's another thing that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the world and a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the editors and photographers of the HS and to continue the debate.
The Sanomat of Helsinki has been organizing the evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular and often finished from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the spectator.
The black box was rewarded in the Bonnier gala for the year as a journalist act.
The rewarders thanked a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come near their readers.
In the spring season 2019, the black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The presentation also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has different content than in the autumn evenings.
The missing mushroomer was found because of "an unprecedented experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is the top of the world: "We are asked for training"
According to the Director of the Police College, the police may use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in criminal investigations and inquiries.
On Tuesday, Oulun police managed to find the missing fungi drone in Rahahe only within a few minutes.
Principal Kimmo Himberg of the Police College was televising the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with unconscious experimentation and effective training, we are the top of the world here too".
Drone's quite new, and even more new in police duties.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There's so much interest in that, Himberg says.
It would be a hell of a storm of visitors to see the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more common.
Himberg reminds us that finding missing in Finnish winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As it has been said, in the case of Raahe, the deceased was found with the drone in only a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're meant to be trained more.
There is already a lot of use of drone for police tasks, and their use is becoming common and growing in the future.
That's what I dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, according to Himberg, for example, in the case of accidental or crime scene investigations and in some forms of inquiry.
For example, we need to check out some area a little further, where there may be fears that violence is being encountered.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby rose to the first divergent.
Karjalan Rugby's party in Kuopia on Saturday, the winning of two-division divisions.
The Joensuus were still in the middle of the match with 7-12 losses for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but during the second period they found a plan and sanded the guests of the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelia Rugby had a historic rise in his 1-division.
The club has played in the first place, but then the Finnish Rugby serial activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and its multisectoral 1-division.
The Society intends to accept the serial scene, but it will know a great job next winter.
The current stash of less than 20 players must be raised to 25.
1.Division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the acquisition of funds must also be consistent with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the main coach
On the Twitter account, the Montreal Canadiens chief coach, who plays in the Ice Hockey NHL, confirmed the company that the Finnish player Jesperi Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super promise for Kotkaniemen, 18, on the first round of the three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal’s rehearsal strength from the end of summer and has made strong picks in September’s training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to make a goal in his first training match.
Principal Coach Julien complimented the Finn to take large development steps after his arrival to the camp.
The NHL frame series begins next week in the night before Thursday, Finland's time.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening round.
What's a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In his interview with the HS, President Risto Siilasmaa, the Nokia Government, an optimist of Paranoid, in which he enlightens leadership in his philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollia.
Ollila strongly disputed the accusations, but even the previous Nokia reports have mentioned the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and nonsense, which caused the collapse of mobile traffic.
The risk-taking and agitation of the company's uptake phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, Nordic Business Forum, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Fair Center, was also organised in Helsinki.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars of business rose up to the stage.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
The legend of the guide guides Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are most mentally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the whole foods chain known as a wide variety of organics, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can not be simply the purpose of making profits to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the success book, told me that the most successful leaders are researchedly humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodar of the financial sector reminded me that the characteristics of a good leader should be one of the stages of the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A grown-up company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
At the Nordic Business Forum, 7 500 visitors listened to these lessons - mostly Finnish leaders.
When they were at risk, they had information.
A lot is required from a good leader.
That is why leadership is so often misleading, including at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the cults.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to assess outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrived in a brilliant red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifinal in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss in the Finnish dress was also a pitch of lace.
A little Jet Lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's famous.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles.
He's done ads, among other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, and also as in Finland.
Although he says that work must be done even more harder, it is easy to find a substitute for the model to work.
I've got to be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a great Volvo searched for the operation: "We can't tell you what"
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the Juditerrauma and the Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Sjännin was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police searched for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the Deputy Head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We found the car we found.
We still can't tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm, about the report from the Copenhagen police, tells Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo you're looking for has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told me about the police press conference on Saturday.
Inspector Jørgen Bergen Skov was in the middle of the silence operation.
He didn't want to tell you what criminal code he was investigating.
But Skov said it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the STT states that there is no longer any concern for the public, because there was a threat to certain people.
For decades, Macedonia's name has caused a breakdown... now the people are voting on the matter in controversial elections.
The proposal for a new name of the country is currently being voted in Macedonia in the Balkans.
According to the Agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the North Macedonian Republic would be named.
Greece has so far blocked the efforts of Macedonia to become a NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern county.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports the membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
The vote began at least at a school in the centre of Skopje in the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse, called for support for the agreement.
The referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contact with independent Macedonia.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has been campaigning for the adoption of the agreement.
The National Opposition of Rights, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has also called for a referendum to be boikotoed.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to stress whether the volume of vote increases by more than 50 %.
The referendum is not binding, but the winning of yes would allow the mandate to amend the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also adopt the agreement.
The voting sites will be closed from 8 p.m. in Finland.
That's a handsome victory!

Canada is fighting the time to reach the agreement with the United States of Nafta
Time threatens to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a rear limit on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
On President Donald Trump's demand, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement for Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but Canada has not yet reached agreement.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force the agreement before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador enter into office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that the plans are to sign the agreement at the end of November were either with Canada or not.
In view of these schedules, the text of the US-Canada contract should be ready on Sunday so that the United States Congress will have sufficient time to assess it.

The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.

Students act as a rare delicious: an ancient tragedy - aggravated Oresteia affects their visuality
Ancient tragedy is rarely delicious on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought to the National Theatre tour the only whole of an ancient play trilogy, Orestheia of Aiskhylos.
In the Lavat Open! projects started in 2015, the theatre High School's actor students work internationally with a professional instructor.
This fourth project, as was the first, is the director of Mikko Roiha, a resident in Berlin.
His international premiere night, Oresteia was awarded in Berlin in April.
The reconciliation of Roiha from Orestheia summarises the report of the end of the family of the destroyed Athreus and the birth of the rule of law in an hourly manner to twenty minutes, particularly by compiling the chorus sections.
The work will succeed in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon, a great Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre pages reveal an exhibit highlight a mere and bright stage thinking.
Its centre is interchangeable with the dynamics between the performers who leave the choir, who play the name roles, and the choir.
The show uses both double-and-three seats for name roles.
The actors are not leaving the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returned from the Trojan war, and this battle Hall of war are shown on the scene, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the presentation does not highlight being loyal to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, which is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in raising up a group of artistic students, directly as a single organism, a group of rhythms.
Particularly in the chorus sections, very expressive, sculpture-like group designs, actors who tend to be able to access their rights on the ground, only by decorating the white front line, on the stage.
Impressive.
Orestheia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer prepares his first hydrogen loader

We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanking network, In Cheol Lee, Deputy Managing Director of Hyundai Motor, said the agreement in the field of publicity.
The fists swinged on several occasions in Kajaan
A little over thirty - year - old man assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal.
In the outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when a third man was in a position, the assassin hit him.
The police caught the assassin.
At the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another policeman into his leg.
He also threatened the police by assassination and killing.
He was taken into prison to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three assaults and as a violent opposition of the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, another assault on the Mid street occurred Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kayan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down, and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assassins away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the authors had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking the witnesses to contact Kajani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail of the investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio runner Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term supplier, died of cancer when he was 83 years old.
Radio runner Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unparalleled liver cancer, reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, we're on our way.
Even the doctor has said it, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of trade in adults and sediments must be ensured
For the first time, I was hired in 1984.
When these tyres surprise some topic, it is usually about the big news.
When I wrote (Caryan, 27.9.) about the safety of retailers, I was amazed and even a bit angry.
I also talked to the matter about the Working Environment Expert Erika Kähärä.
He says that criminal statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of the cases which have been clearly serious and many of the real violence situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to statistically close their situation on the basis of the Working Safety Act, but these statistics remain in the internal use and not to collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
The problem of violence has always been that they do not always have physical injuries.
However, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the situation of violence that threatens it is difficult to draw away when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence - even if there is no access to it.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even though there is no real act.
Some areas of residence are unrest.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours were released, the media also had a rather high steaming effect on the safety of sellers.
"Sometimes, many employers arranged security services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone", Sparrow commented.
If nothing happens, we'll make the wrong conclusion.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
In view of the security, when the disturbances remained well under control, an imagination was made that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
A mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who had been assaulted does not want to make an inquiry on a criminal who usually lives near the trade.
However, according to the same paragraph of the law provided for in 2011, a mild assault will become subject to the prosecution if it takes place at work.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time the trade aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should be investigated and accused by the prosecutor.
If the court put a few assassins in jail, and the punishment from the hard end of the punishment scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society where food stores must be open to small municipalities for almost nights should ensure the safety of workers in the market.
Heidi Sohlberg signed Miss before the start of the direct shipment - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
It is not the traditional way to see Miss chubby this year on TV, but it is the Viafree website of the broadcast.
The shipment is scheduled by former Miss Heidi Sohlberg and master of Viasat and Viaplayn NHL and KHL Studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red rug are the runner of Janni Hussi.
Before a direct broadcast, the host triangle told the visitors and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula the brutal applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this one of our men's drinkers, Sohlberg sparked his colleagues in the hurrage of the audience.
Preliminary races are followed by many of the previous years, Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to them and sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iro's married!
Sohlberg was blocking towards Sarok.
What more sohlberg was more likely referring to the just divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though at first it seemed confused.
The Sieppi spoke for the first time in the Ilta-Sanations journal.
Missikaunotar told me that he did not want to open the reasons for the distinction in public, because it is between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't busy with a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and in particular, I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The status of Harjula’s marriage came up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The clerk three laughed at me.
Iirohan was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed a mistake.
The Northman tortured his tied up by cutting, burning and feeding a powerful sauce
The North-West Court of Justice has condemned a man of the age of 34 who lived in Kokkola for a period of three years in prison for several offences committed by his open-ended spouses.
The tool for committing crime was, among other things, a belt, a cable, and a cable.
The court condemned these items to be lost to the State.
The accusation of the suspect was a serious rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected.
Four assaults, gross assaults, forced forced, illegal threats, violations of freedom, gross freedom violations, and two acts of harm.
Crime occurred between 26 March last and 24 May.
At the end of the last actions, the man was captured and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday of the last week, the Arctic Court of Northwest issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two gross freedom violations and the gross rape that took place on 22 May.
However, these accusations were rejected by the court as unprecedented.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the Court of Justice issued a public report on the judgment.
According to the circumstantial judge, the accused had been subject to violence, threats, and forced in situations where this had been committed.
The defendant sliced his victim with a knife, burned a cigarette, fed a potent sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to be lost criminal instruments: the belt and cable, the ties, the bathing jacket belt, the knife and the vest.
Four Witnesses
According to the court of law, the parties continued to live together between acts.
It is noted in the resolution that a large part of the most serious actions occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A person aged 34 should pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary disadvantages of EUR 5800.
He hardly has that money, because he already has debts in his possession.
Prison is not the man's first.
The evening magazine doesn't mention a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case when you write this.
Europe in charge of four points to Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe leads to the Ryder Cupi play in Paris at 10-6 points when the twelve twelve games are still in front of us on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon, the winnings were equal to 2-2.
Europe's leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four of the games they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European couples had reached the same.
On Sunday, the twin seeks more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and the Americans have only reached three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the harsh disruption of its supporters in the Honka match: "The violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, the Football League HJK published a notice condemning the disruption of its supporters at a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologise for events after the Honka-HJK match for our supporters," says the press release.
After the fight ended, about 50 HJK supporters jumped into the field and some appeared to be seeking to challenge a dispute with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
Arrangers did not calm the situation down, but police and horse police were needed there.
When HJK announces that the players and employees of the team are shocked by what has happened.
After the fight, the events are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We are strongly departing from all the activities that jeopardise the security of the battle events," says the press release.
The HJK allows authorities and organisers to assist in identifying and removing the mitigation effects of the security.
The supporter culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We all support positive, happy and encouraging activities in the football surveys.
"It's not part of violence," says the press.
A Philippines inventor flys a drone car, thus avoiding traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Philippines inventor, a hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group in the world who swears he's invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to the reports from the world, a man has used a large proportion of his property to build his dream.
Six years ago, he started the development of his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he's done the first successful test flight... he's flagged on his machine at seven feet.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope the device raises positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Working activities will begin tomorrow in children’s day care and social and health services
In public and well-being sectors, overtime and shift bans start tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and in children’s day care, will be assessed by the President of the JHL Day Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone's going to have to think about how to get their children.
The employer's task is now to ensure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when the members of JHL were banned from overworking and shifting due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff has not been hired, but that workers have left overtime or have changed their shifts.
This isn't a work fight yet.
It is a standard standard job-protection that every employee will be kept concerned about regular working hours and only do so.
JHL objects to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of redundancy for small companies.
Mr Markku Jalonen, the Director of Municipal Employers' Labour Markets, does not in advance assess the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very transformative, even though services can be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what can be done.
The area is so wide, so difficult to say, social and health measures and the technical sector.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employers, and Jalonen said to STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week, experience was already gained, among other things, from the three-day activities of the Super and the Social and Health Professional Organization.
Their effects were rather limited.
The prohibition on overtime and exchange of shifts in JHL concerns, inter alia, workers in municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
At this stage, the fight concerns almost 100 000 members of JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may last for a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other work fighting activities if the drafting of the dismissal Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is running into the wall and hard.
Mr. Jelosen believes that both the ay movement and the government must come up against it.
It's special that the hard ones are already on the beep, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen will update.
The great coral ritual is born in the fitness circles of children and adults, studying the gestures of crustaceans and sea horses.
In the other premises, the Great Coralties received their first night last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was presented second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coralition is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end with the public.
However, this time a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallise the findings of the initial practice.
In the theater games, there's plenty of saddle magic for children's participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase.
However, large coral ritualism is not a child performance, but a performance performed by adults and children in collaboration.
It gives adults information and observations about children's way of receiving information and making art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint cuts also slides the distance between adults and children.
The great coral ritual resembles some satubaletic, fitness circles and nature-related information attacks, but ultimately it comes around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The great coral ritual begins with access to the business lines of corals and coral rituals and living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness circles teach, among other things, the gestures of raspberry and sea horses.
Finally, a little hour long show is made where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes help us get to know the life of the coral rive.
There are both diving people in the Great Corallyriuta who observe the life of the coral rites and the corals that are examined.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
The sights and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life dense.
Whether to be a landscape of an organism, to look at the landscape, and to look at another organism or landscape, and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem that hard.
In other premises, the group is trying to pursue the limit of thinking and action to which access when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, child involvement makes it more important.
After a workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitrator for the endangered corals.
It should not be allowed to harden the destruction of man’s understanding, even though it could be difficult to understand the importance of exercising his own sympathy in the face of destructive prospects.
In other premises, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life with a political gesture.
There are other generations, other kinds of knowledge, other species, and future generations of generations, whose wonders and plays it clean up.
Children grow up too fast. I'm glad there were no smartphones when I was a kid.
Today, children and young people are increasingly responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking while you are younger and younger.
I think that children should be children all the time of their childhood and not mess with their lives because of drug and sex, because others say that they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in the fifth grade at the "boyfriend" weekend.
When she came to pick up her humiliated sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned about all of our childhood that we should not touch dope and sex is a adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a proper childhood, and they do not need to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing in Instagram the younger girls who are in their faces with makeup and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send images to reveal at night.
It's harder for girls to know how old they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was about playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: The authorities told the Government that the Airisto Pearl case was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva’s interview, the defence police and defence forces visited to inform the defence and foreign committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that the Airiston Helme investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to the Canary, the defence and defence officers visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily regarded as economic crime.
They were very tight that they did not speculate that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented on the Yle interview.
According to the above information, no evidence has been found in confiscated material to date on the link to national security, but the investigation is only underway.
There is no way yet to know what can be revealed from there, one of the people who interviewed Yle tells us.
A week ago, large home searches in Turku's island and continent have raised the question of whether it is a matter of economic crime or of a threat to Finland's internal security.
The evening magazine used to compile this week a case that goes through both sides and against the arguments.
Video: The dream Maal saved a series lost by Liverpool
Liverpool’s 100 percent start was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 team on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be the same year after Manchester City arrived at the Stamford Bridge and escaped the 1-0 guest victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Valioliga signal that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûrgen Klopp, arrived with the same idea in Western London.
The Reds had started with six consecutive wins of Valioliiga.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone in his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had under Wednesday's fine liquor pickup from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the match with a fantastic individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the beginning.
For 25 minutes, he first balled in a small state with a tribute with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard exploding and sent him a fully weighted pass feed.
Hazard fell a bit on the edge of the punishment area, but he bombed a perfectly left foot bet in the back of the bottom of the bet.
The pool's brass guard, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger head in the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss station lightly unjustly because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger put Mo Salah's guidance on the goal line.
In the second episode, the Chelsea Vessel Kepa also got into real action.
The Basque guard reacted rapidly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the dust to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson threw zero on his way through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino at the center.
However, the blossom of the brass star was heading towards the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts’ leadership.
That didn't last for the 89th minute when the changer Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 yards.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to the top of an unresponsive bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league started with 1 1, but it's still in the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea also has two points behind the tip strictly involved in the championship.
In the clock transfer debate, the pothers are deep
I remember a decade ago, when a magazine asked various Finnish actors, which shares the Finnish people.
The answer of Juice Lesk was the only one that remembered: Nen end.
Some have a nen-head and some aren't.
There's no way you're going to have divisions anywhere, and there's one offer.
Finland in the EU has achieved the abandonment of the annual clock transplant.
Many agree that clock transplantation twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide which time will end at the end of the current summer or winter or some other time zone.
This is also a way for the people to say their opinion on the sampling position.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open to Friday on 12 October.
The debate is intensely held on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
With the impact of the morning light on the wellbeing of people and the summer time, those defend the impact of the evening light on people's outdoor desire and thus on their well-being.
Both views have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to the research, morning light causes a rash of human day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives you more opportunities, for example, for the autumn yards.
The number of extra lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I'd rather take both of them, but badly, we can't do anything in the north collar of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers are too light for many anyway.
A typical debate on the subject is to drive our own view, and the second is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the counterparty are not much listened, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn another head.
It's burning up the quartets.
The subject is very easy to argue, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and it is sufficient to justify a mutual feeling.
In general, it is the most rigorous and fruitless issue.
Well, it'll be a shame if the wrong choice becomes chosen, but you'll fit it too.
And it always offers a suitable sinshoe if life feels underground.
Josba fought the odds of the odds.
Josba's first guest game in the Salibandy Divar produced Nurmon Jymy against full three serial points.
Josba left the Seinäjoki on his way home with a cheerful victory of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
The Nurmo still led the paint at the beginning of the third set, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Front and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted in the 6-5 winning paintings.
In both teams, critical minutes were played on the balance.
The most effective Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowered anyway when the Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenki (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of its goal.
After three series rounds, Josba has six points.
Next time, O2-Jyväskylä will come to visit us in two weeks.
In the church of Eno on Sunday, the 200th anniversary party
The 200th anniversary of the Enon Church will be celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the burning of the church at the excitement danger was a shock.
My uncle's church was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party place today.
Even if no one wants to, the church of Enon is now the oldest church in Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The family fair starts at Eno church today at 10:00.
Then we will move to the church house at the cattle’s table.
The program has all kinds of things inside and outside all day long.
For example, you can learn from the church building with the guidance of the retired, 37 years minister Ari Räsäs.
The Church's birthday also means the end of one era.
The church house already decommissioned in 1982 will open its doors today for the last time.
Now we're in creekhouses in the former colonial house, says Kappalainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed inner air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk is out of the chair of the Tesla Government's speech, and the charges of fraud were settled at $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the CEO Elon Musk have agreed their case with the SEC of the U.S. Securities Market Supervisor.
SEC suspected Musk had committed a securitisation, and Musk was in danger of being abandoned for the company he set up.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to avert the chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire the president of the external government.
Musk is also subject to stricter supervision.
According to the Agreement, Tesla must hire two independent leaders and continue to monitor Musk communication more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay both $20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the adverse effects of Tesla's shareholders", says Director Steven Peikin from SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The TV took up Tesla's stock rate for a moment.
SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a securitisation.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential donors.
In practice, the Agency accused Muskia of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that Musk was to be sentenced to fines and that he was banned from acting under the management of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong downturn.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami
In Indonesia, the number of dead in the earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country’s disaster agency, according to AFP.
It is believed that the number of victims of death will continue to increase because we are in the process of exterminating the destruction.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake lifted a tsunami that attacked a town in the island of Sulawes, please.
It was immediately after the earthquake, a warning that was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least so far the Remuneration.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala region near the center of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people already know they're dead.
Rare requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
The President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the devastation area today, called on soldiers to continue their rescues without exhausting their days and nights.
One of the rescues is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to have 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the Rescue Office, told us that one person was found alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, popular by business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaurg, a rapid excavator would be needed in the landing and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their closest people in the missing ones.
Help me, you in the Remuneration and in the vicinity.
My friend's family still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Political phone numbers leaked into the hands of disturbing people in Britain
Many British politicians were disrupted when their contact information leaked because of the deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The disruptions were accessed, among other things, by the telephone numbers of ministers.
This was an application used at the British Conservative Party meeting in the government.
For example, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, were being disturbed.
A number of parliamentary representatives received assault calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public has access to profiles using a politician’s e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who entered the profile was able to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson into a profile picture of a porn photo and a title for an offensive.
Michael Goven's profile photo was changed by the mediamogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian Colomnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows access to other people's profiles by e-mail addressing them.
Then you can view the profile person's contact details and, for example, send messages in this name.
The application of the meeting made a public criticism of each supplier, politician and participant’s telephone number, Foster.
The Conservative Party reporter apologized for the data leakage.
He said that technical problems have been solved and that the application now works safely.
The British Information Authority, ICO, supports data leakage.
The application was made by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland audience has a large number of penetration Polish people every week
The Watched Viewers drew attention to the reaction of the studio audience of the The Wall Finland programme.
The United States' rapidly spread in the world The Wall ran the Finnish version to Four last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's host game show is described in Poland in the same studio as other international productions in the format.
In the Polish studio, the description opportunities were exceptional, as the large 12 metres high in the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the programme’s studio audience, which was depicted as a Polish.
In Twitter, there was a debate on whether or not the Polish people in the studio would understand anything about the game to be played as Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, chief of four domestic programs, illustrates the issue for the evening magazine.
He tells us that there are close players in the studio audience, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international assaults in Finnish production, as are the audiences of the The Wall periods described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such people, so-called professional audiences, who are in various programmes, backs up the fingers.
He reminds me that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language with which it is played.
The red and green balls that fall from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for the foreign language who carry out the translation work.
There are two translators that interpret the events of the studio director as a simulant emblem.
And then the studio director will guide the audience and tell them what kind of laptop is thrown there, and what's going on, Sormunen says.
He compared the situation with David Hasselhoff in domestic production recently.
David Hasselhoff was in Talent Finland a few years ago.
He had all the time a simulated burst into his ears, and he knew everything in his illustrations that was spoken as Finnish, the sum of the ring.
The southern parts of Japan are broken orphan heading towards the main island, the authorities warn the land and the floods.
The authorities also warn possible land zones and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifun Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the death victims so far.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated in shelters and electricity has been cut off by over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in position because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka for six months in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also tough winds and rains.
The train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami will torture Japan until Monday.
The Heaven of the Aces went darker
The early days have been bad.
The sky blurred almost as long as the team lost on Saturday's homeland to Vaasa Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and six rounds of points are a total of two.
No Ace defender or two lower chain player has yet made the goal.
Pressure also increases all the time.
Sports against the audience were disregarded even at the time of almost half of the game left.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that much we played weakly.
Especially the presentation of the second set was shamefully bad, the Ace power of 1+2 made Jarno Kärki.
Of course, it tasted a sport's victory.
The team had a game underneath Friday, so I thought it would have been seen doing it.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Goodrinen, is wondering the number of events at the big gym.
Somehow, he thought that maybe this year there would not be so many people, Mr. Goodrinen, to think about this morning.
In the autumn 2017, together with the Leisure Day, the Tractorikünn SM contests were held at the same time, so maybe it would be expected that the audience could even decrease a little from the previous year.
On the other hand, however, the corridors were backed up quickly before ten, the sellers said the products were out, the news drum was sold more than 500 doses earlier, and even the number of cars Goodrine heard was rising.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, and Jórinen will tell you later in the afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, five hours were particularly suitable for children’s families, which must have attracted them to the record.
In addition, Hyrinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also go to Liper every year from a larger area.
In this year, the rapporteurs, the vendors of conceptual works, baking and harvesting products, had arrived at the breadkeeper almost 100.
The bread day mother, PIrkko Goodrinen, fascinated the audience from the hall view.
A harvest was blessed at the beginning of the bread day.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won a public vote.
11 different forms of bread came to the children's bread contest.
Marjatta Vepsälainen, the winner of the rustic bread contest, spent the day in the pie of the martyrs.
7 x the most beautiful light... here you recognize a good lamp.
Wake up the condition, create the right atmosphere for the decoration and read the book without being tired.
It's a good light. It's a good light.
We gathered three good reasons to bet on the light.
The tips were given by Innolux's sales and marketing director, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do me a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases the more ages are behind.
Sufficient light can help to deal with problems that come to many with age when vision accuracy decreases and aggravates more and more.
In the past, the need for light increases.
A 60-year-old needs a light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Thus, it is worth sausing for health reasons for the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
A good lighter gives enough light, but it does not shine, Jokiniemi's tip.
Create Beauty around you
Beautiful decoration can only be revealed with correct lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
The popularity is a Japanese style that combines gestureless, Scandinavian and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, modern and playing retrotyl with strong colours, with different metal tones or ice creams from the 70s have risen up to the bum.
The authenticity fascinates the same way as the home in other decorations.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more will be invested than before, and the decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to be tailored to their own home, a bold lighter with a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products, whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-intelligent, Jokiniemi says.
It is not necessarily the latest trend lighter, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewelry and elegant classics keep their feet one year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and see you!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian fighter after three games
Coco and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are broken.
The Canadian stunt played a total of three league games without power points in the orange black, KooKoo explains in its communication.
O'Donnell moved to Kookoo in August with a one-year agreement, which included a test period lasting until the end of September.
During the last year, the 26-year-old assault played at KHL in the Red Star lines of Kunlund and the KHL farm in VHL, RS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic switched to paper.
The game specialty game is now recycled in addition to the games, including packaging materials.
The products of the Kivifoot store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in recycled paper bags.
The products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in the packets from importers.
All the packages that come to us are going to be used again.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in the state that it can be used, Ville Puurula of Oulu tells us about the gameman.
As softening material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
The coupling doors are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move in envelopes to recycling material.
The business wants to set an example for others.
Turning around isn't supposed to cause any more trouble.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also be economic savings when, for example, cardboard packages are reused.
Circumvention is suitable for the gameman's activities, as along with new products, the key product selection of the movement includes the games and equipment used.
Each fashion-informed acquisition: One and the same shirt works in every costume
Classic clothes work from age to age in a costume.
They create the basis of a good garderobi in their multi-use, as it is easy to collect different costumes around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most classics used in the wardrobe are high-quality stitches.
This category also includes a black pool.
The black knit made of natural material with the pool crochets cannot be a defective supply.
The clothing can be combined with both straight pants, boring beans and jeans, and it can be surrounded by both a restrained costume and a blurred style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic fine-tuned style artist.
I saw you create a style.
Autumn trends are produced from gold brown and wide-coloured spices, black pools and grey ankles.
The classic poolonele, together with other classics, blue green scotch and wine-red loafers, constitutes a feminine and refined set of costumes.
It breaks in the black tub with it combining it with trendy clothing pieces: a jeans skirt, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that foreign intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelna and group: sabotage and intelligence group.
In the West of the Soviet Security Service of the KGB, the agents prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports the KGB's offensive archive manager Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century.
The targets included ports, docks, large dams, oil processing plants and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired uniforms and clothing for cover operations for the DRG groups for Bundeswehr, railways, castle guards and road workers.
This tricket was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established inspection stations from the peninsula to the leaders of Ukraine and separated from their mother of Crimea.
Cold Wartime agents hid supplies with mines, explosives, lighters and communication equipment in the sabotage groups.
In 1998 there was still a KGB's hiding place in Switzerland, which was exploded by the authorities injecting it with water tyres.
By the night, the police reached four steadfasts in the county.
The police got caught across the North Carelia four steering drinks between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the Contio Bay blew 1,57 proms.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaninines at mid-four o'clock.
On the knee lake, the car crashed at four o'clock, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 prom, according to the police.
He didn't get any serious injuries at the outlet.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old local man driving a passenger car blowing alkmeter of 1.33 proms.
The police suspected these male drivers of serious drinking and of endangering road safety in addition to the Knee Lake driver.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man transporting a local van in the crossing of the Oils and Hoikante was blowing up 0.52 prom.
He's being suspected of a steering drink.
The police are asking for observations about stabbing at the Turku Railway Station after midnight.
According to the police, a man was assaulted at the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
Black-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jacket immediately after stabbing a dark farmer car Railyard in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left the Humaliston street in the middle of the bike.
A pedestrian died freezing under a bus in Pori.
In the porch, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after the bus hit him.
An accident occurred after four in the morning in Raumant in the area of Soutumaa.
There's no doubt about the driver of the bus.

Real story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man’s own experience.
The movie of the evening was made on the basis of them.
Everest will now have his premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a destructive snow storm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormaker’s 2015 guidance reports about the survival struggle that has been dealt with in the field.
The tragedy has been filmed and documented before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
22 years ago, the world’s highest mountain took the life of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just Hall who worked as a Weathers guide.
Weathers could have saved his life before he left Nepal.
As a result of this pressure and air pressure, he lost his vision, so the summit had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on the road and didn't come back.
However, the struggle of Weathers from life and death had just begun.
When the storm got up, he got lost and found no more in the camp.
When they came to find him, they found him in such a bad state that they were not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
It's like a miracle store he got on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers was thought to still die, and once again he was left behind his own happiness.
Obviously, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even with the climbers began to believe in the possibility of helping him.
In the film, Beck Weathers is performing Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is a celebration of the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and the entire family’s feast was prepared for the anniversary of the Sunday.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. on Eno’s church hill, after which there was an offering of the cattle’s table at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.
517 people were involved in the family ministry.
The Iron Mountain of Enon was happy that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, the Iron Mountain (in the picture) says.
The fire of the church of excitement has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the church of Eno.
The church of Enon is now the oldest Facilities of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations of Joensuu after the church was destroyed in a fire.

In the event of an expedition there was an assault in the morning, where the church that was destroyed was slowed down and remembered in the fire.
Photos and videos: My medican flashed his power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane storm wandered from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medican is named Zorba.
The Greek Aviation Institute has given red weather warnings to the regions of Athika, Peloponnesos, the Ionian Islands, Kyklades and Crete.
There are plenty of floods all over Greece in the pictures taken from the region.
The video published in Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the territory of Korinthia instead of the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the southern part of the Peloponnecus peninsula, the wind caused a powerful sea trip.
The Ambassador of Finland instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for weather information and local authorities to be followed.
The Mediterranean hurricane, a medican, is bringing with it heavy fires and even the danger of flooding.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 indicates that medians occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on September-October roads when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm that is now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before going north and towards Europe.
The concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The storm is also undermined in the summer by the ruined areas of the terrestrial areas in the Athens environment.
In Greece, the medican was also riled last November.
There's no need to go to the sea now, but the flights are still scheduled in the Greek islands threatened by the storm are currently on vacation with thousands of Finns.
The trips to the sea are canceled and even walking should be careful not to flew on the storm of the pieces or other fragments.
These guidelines have been distributed to 3 500 guides in Greece through sun travels to a Finnish holiday weekend.
The instructions will be needed, for even the storm of Zorbas, which is abundant to the horror readings, has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the nearest island of Crete, the wind speed can rise to 45 metres per second.
Rain rains that increase the weather's viciousness.
All travellers from Finland who have reported their phone numbers have been warned about the winds by means of a text message through the solar trips and Tuin.
In the air, it's still sun and heat.
According to Inka Ikose, the specialist for solar travel communications has avoided the worst in holiday destinations by the beginning of Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and rose according to normal schedules.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
We're going ahead of security.
I supported the media inspector Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also travelled on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our personnel on the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early night on Saturday.
At present, the most popular Greek islands, Rodoks and Crete, have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm in the island will be reached on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodoks had mocked the sun and the temperature was at 27 degrees, says Ikonen of sun travels.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turkish prick, although a bit lessened.
In this case, we have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying in Antalya Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvise and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in the missile-- this is how they react to the situation.
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland's final Saturday in an open evening suit.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store, and I decided to trust the professionals who found me a beautiful suit for this night, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening suit had also been chosen by the manager Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself noticed the same costumes and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on a plane.
The Hussi works as the backstage and red carpet runner in the Missifinal, and he talks about the most incoming front stars.
Huss has a fresh move behind him because he moved from Kampi to Dump Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what's happening.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi's thinking.
Before he moved, Hussi was on her own in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel a week without leaving.
When I got stressed out, I got a flu, but otherwise I had a really successful holiday, Hussi will tell you.
Shirly Karvise's use on the plane attracted a lot of attention to collecting the curious eyes of the retired people.
The director and the 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told her that she had had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland films on the red carpet of Miss Finland.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair's flight, the speed has been sufficient.
I makeup and I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home for the nightdress, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he's pulled out his makeup in the middle of the retired people.
His preparation also attracted the attention of the travellers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people look at the mirror.
My makeup was a pleasure, at least in the opinion of others.
Karvinen flys to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that he enjoyed his detainees as the Finnish leader of Love Island.
He describes his experience as well as being stopping so far.
Karvinen tells me he's been to see you on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are human real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's singles.
How am I dressing overgeneration boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothes are clothing items that work from age to age in a costume.
Often, classics are decades old, but sometimes they can fit the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overgeneration boots have not gone anywhere.
According to his name, the boots above the knee are repeatedly stylish in the year and the season.
Seeming boots share user opinions, but a brave model should be tried, well - bravely.
In fact, the overgeneration boots actually fit in what kind of costumes.
It's about jeans, pigeons, chicks, or tricos, and the boots are simple leather or artificial leather surfaces.
Long boots look good in both the celebration cabinets and the ark costumes.
Black overgeneration boots are well suited to a bleak set of costumes.
They adequately balance the femaleity of a pink, flowered plyser and bleached, tiny needle.
Raikas, but autumn stylish coat for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited costume is produced from a long copper brown opalescent, overgeneration boots, showing earrings and twinklet bag.
Although there is a certain refinement in the overgeneration boots, they also perfectly fit together with a relaxed arkhole with a T-shirt, long shorts and a trendy box.
It's so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, Espoo city informs.
Otaniemi's robot cars play the role of the bus simulator, as next spring in the region is intended to launch transport by robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year-end robotic vehicles and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The test will find out how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars are automatically driven by other transport without special transport arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always responsible for an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their environment all the time with a number of different sensors and assess whether the route is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snow shaft, the Sensible 4 CEO Harri Santamala, responsible for the development of robot traffic.
Robot cars travel throughout the fall on three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10:15 and Thursdays at 10:15 a.m.
Robot cars stop by six stops along the way and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops identify the stop marks.
I'm sure you can get a ride from the stop in Otakaare, number 1.

Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The Itä-Suomen police department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Riistakeskus in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's bay crew reported on Saturday on social media.
The main focus of supervision was the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required in the state countries.
In addition, the authorisations for the possession of hunting weapons and the authorised volumes of self-charging weapons used for sewerage were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the inspection, and only one hunter was met during the inspection, missing the required hunting permit.
A 12-day fine was assigned to the hunter for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown by the police, and two of them were suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, the police.
Conclusion is that hunters respect the promise of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised to control.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Itä-Suomen police department will continue hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The silence goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (Kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
In Finland, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been decided this year.
Electoral trips are usually made a few times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey to conduct interviews.
Firstly, the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are deemed to be particularly indispensable in refugee camps, such as single care families, disabled persons and sick people, women and children.
In Finland, more people are selected than in the quota, because some of them are virtually not present for various reasons.
It also meets the non-governmental organisations operating on the borders of Syleyman Soylu and Syria, the Turkish Minister of Interior.
Ilkka Salmi, Secretary General of the Ministry of Interior, is also involved.
Quota lifted
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a few years, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen against the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently presented a gradual increase of quotas to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
A quiet visit is the first visit during this period of government to be carried out by the Minister of Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Ministers of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) were able to move to their new assignments before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 support from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now let's go to the barges, and we don't know if we're crying or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen was news of a bill to change the animal protection law.
The article came to the conclusion that the draft legislation in principle prohibits the holding of all animals which are not individually authorised by ministries’ regulations as production animals, pets or otherwise business activities.
Therefore, all other animals not specifically referred to in the Regulation are fundamentally prohibited.
If the legislative proposal comes to law, it is likely that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democrats that the law separately prohibits action that jeopardises the security of society or the good way of doing so.
It is now in principle that there is a ban on all the activities to which the law or regulation does not specifically authorise.
This change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else to do until the law or regulation adopted by it has been adopted.
The government's activities in law-making have generally been weak.
If we now go to the path that everything that is not allowed separately is prohibited in Finland, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the legal project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the constitution very well, but whether it accepts such a "all things are prohibited which are not individually permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope that there will be a wise minister who will stop the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: Autumn four trendiest skirts
This autumn trend is coming in snake tissues.
It looks particularly good in the skirts.
Combine a snake-shaped skirt with more controlled upper parts, such as a pool or a normal T-shirt, so that the costume remains stylish.
This autumn there is plenty of silk, and in particular the silk skirt is one of the most trendy pieces of clothing in the season.
Connect the magnificent silk skirt finely with the female upper part or relax with the knitting.
You can play with the Silk Hatch more bravely and throw into your legs, for example, the lenses or the trendy cowboy boots of the fall.
It doesn't matter if it's grey, brown or multi-thane, all the dresses of the square are now part of every woman's must have-like clothes.
Strongly connect different colors to each other and play with the rods of diamonds on a separate top.
For example, the combination of diamonds and sphere holes is beautiful.
Unsymmetrical pearls are a breeze of the lightness of the summer that can be taken with them to the autumn.
The unsymmetry pearl is also female and plays and fits greatly in both the ark and the feast.

Kim Räikkönen crystalized the cause of Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrar.
Ferrar's Kim Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too tough at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to fall into panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver will evaluate.
They were just faster than we are, but it's not about anything huge.
Our car was the best in time all weekend for now, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven, and with Sebastian Vettelin, the Mercedes speed that was clearly left on the Mercedes.
Ferrar had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
They asked him why the sudden fall of Mercedes was rightly due to the ride.
They seem to go faster than we do, so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
During time, rare deliciousness was seen for the Sauber, the Sauber of the future Stair of the Räikköse.
Charles Leclerc, the replacement of Ferrar for the next season, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson was also over for the last time driving session.
For the Swedish coach, the tenth destination is the best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers left all the way out in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging in view of the future of the Räiks?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early age, a step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's what Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper, "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed in even marks.
The German was more initiative in the ring, but he couldn't get the right hit.
Clearly more extensive, Helenius controls the match with its hard series that were well found.
Finn was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked up Teper on the left straight.
The hit was so hard that a concoccier who fought before the public even tried to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius flew quite moderately.
In a group interview, he initially praised the public’s good mood and opponent.
Then he switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you for all the audiences and the Finnish incentives.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius's career.
It might even be possible to get to the MM match, and Helenius commented to the Evening newspaper before the fight.
Instead, the loss might have decided the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
This isn't gonna be any younger, Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before Teper met.
The number of victims in Indonesia may be multiplied
According to the Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country urges you to prepare for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Saviors are searching for the trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please, the city of port and its neighbourhood in Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Pal, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been injured.
There are still people in the fragile buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, the hotel Roa Roa has fallen.
The saviors tell me that they have heard the screams of the people who were trapped in the ruins, but the lack of a cleaning body has delayed the beginning of the rescue.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has assigned the army to rescue and eradication.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communication links in the disaster area are broken across many locations.
The fuel reserves are also exhausting.
The suspicious response of Miss Finland’s finalist and long reflection caused a laughter remaka
In Billnäs Ruuk, new Miss Finland is currently being chosen.
At the interview round, a question was asked to each Miss Finalist.
The finalists asked me a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoske, 23, hesitant response was given in the audience at the time of sweet, but good-will laughter.
The question to the Anttikos had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer as good as before he started hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said to think.
In the public, the break of the report took the time of laughter until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After answering, Anttikoski received the public's grudges by laughing.
Anttikoski was attracted to the missile tour because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21 a.m. when the crown will be surrendered last year, Miss Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue by the time it comes.
This recipe is for you with good, acidified apples from your own back, as domestic apples are at a shocking price.

The status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes people popular, charismatic or admiring?
The researchers of Sydney University analysed the subject have identified two different types of "cololity", which are characteristic of a slightly different nature: generally attractive coolness and, in this respect, the contradiction of the contradiction-colity.
Appreciatively cool people, according to the description of researchers, had many socially desired features: they were outward, friendly, peaceful and qualified.
In contrast, there was a typical distance, independence, rebelism and a break.
They were thirsty with experience and only cared little about external evaluations.
Both types combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of harder is not cool longer: a high status in teen age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the United States survey published in 2014 in Child Development reports.
Young people who used to date early, celebrated, applied to good-looking crowds and pursued the favor of others, had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes as young adults.
In their human relationships, they managed less than they used to do with their most unreasonable age mates.
The high-state lock of wolf cars, bags or watches don't make a person cool, or at least genuinely attractive.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine in August, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their normal market shirt than with those dressed in their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a branding shirt.
If you're on a Greek holiday island, watch out!
There's a storm in there, a warning of the weather to shout red.
During the weekend, in southern Greece as much water as the average in Finland during the six months may be raining.
The Zorbas horror storm hits Greece during the weekend.
If you are in Peloponnesos, the Ionian islands, the Kyklate or the Crete region, you should be prepared to do so.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Ateenan Embassy will report it on its Facebook site.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has provided red weather warnings to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported by the weather service in Foreca blog.
According to this, the toughest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to comparison, from the early week, you punched the Kuisma storm with the hardest thighs of 31 metres per second.
According to the Blog, however, the greatest concern of the Storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
The weekend in South Greece may be more than 300 millimetres of water.
It corresponds about half of the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of a storm on its Facebook page.
The Storm of Zorbas has previously caused floods in Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the men drowned Love Island Finland -Ankun?

Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series a beautiful Anku drowned by several men is also present in strange Youtube videos published in 2010.
With videos, Anku advises ascendants, among other things, to prepare an old paperboard in the ink industry.
The anchor also shows his sympathetic style of how the stockings can be struck with a silk for which the real blinks grow.
Now we are making Easter grass grow, but we do it a little surprisingly, Anku suggests and presents the sawdust, panties and seeds of the grass, of which he makes a silk.
You can watch videos underneath or from Ankun Youtube here.
The Lord Bottas shaked and squeezed adrenaline in Sotsh... is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
The Valter Bottas shaked a little more ten minutes after Russia's gp swings when he was in front of the media.
A fine round left Lewis Hamilton, one by Mercedes, and he must have been mentally important even to the Finnish man who was gathering this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left a resolution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I've been on the stake only once this year, in Austria (medium), so the time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I've got a good turn again.
It's not easy to pass on Sotsh's track, so the departure is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to respond to the curiosity whether he was driving tomorrow from the victory or is there before the Jeesaing of Hamilton approaching the MM title.
My starting point for the race is definitely the fact that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the stake, Bottas staker.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettil is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it keeps in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas completed.
After driving, Hamilton was truly happy about Bottaksen’s success, and the Mercedes’ tallipomo toto Wolff also tasted it.
Lewis had a plan to win Valter, but he couldn't do it in the sec.
He knows he's gonna have to tear everything up to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline squeezed out of his ears, Wolff squeezed.
The question is whether the stable will allow Bottaksen and Hamilton to drive straight, Wolff answered in a way.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kristan Erno Kinnunen reached the rall Championship of Finland
The SM series on the racing ended rarely.
Hardly ever before, brothers have ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
It has now been done in the Turku and Salo's environment in the windulas Eerik and Henrik Peternen, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The Kitelainen Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him with the class of two-wheel cars in Finland.
The Kinnune, who competed with Honda Civic, and the manor reader Ville Mäkelä, started at the Turku Championship, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM account.
In the darkness of the Friday night, the twin had to provide an adjustment when some of the extra lights were cheated on another special experiment.
It's got to squeeze a third in a time of blindness.
In a situation like that, it's not a fool.
On Saturday, only one was followed at the speed of Jussi Tepo, said Kinnunen.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw its troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, over.
In his UN speech Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Angela Merkel said in Germany that there is an October meeting for Syria to be attended by the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court of Justice on TV.
The Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received exceptionally many people.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were given the nomination drama of the Supreme Court judge on Thursday.
At that time Kavanaugh, named Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the senate's judiciary to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, were followed by a total of 20,4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultation, several million more followed.
NBC reported that animal trimmeds followed 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they had made a record of 8.2 million live shipments in the year.
The number of CNNs will increase by more than 10 million when it is calculated by Youtube and Facebook who have followed the broadcast.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million.
Digital launches are channels own, TV surveys come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they're anyway dizzy.
It's rare to get to 20 million.
More than 20 million audiences in the United States are usually accessed only to sports games and the big Oscar and Grammy gala and random political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, the US's most prominent annual programme, the American football League for the NFL final match for Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on the NBC channel along the grids.
Last year, the first talk of Trump to Congress, Nielsen, said that the total number of 48 million and 30 million were viewed by officials.
It's the most important thing.
The appointment of the Supreme Court of Justice is an extremely important case in the United States, since offices are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died from early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the bridges of President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by President of the Republic, Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called "white language" on several issues, with the vote to resolve the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of the rights of abortion and sexual minorities and, for example, resolved in 2015 with a vote that the same sexes received the right to marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his people.
His choice in the Supreme Court may be locked in the court for decades of conservative overpower.
Children have the right to get their information to parents
Parents of children under 10 years of age only see the Kanta service of their children’s health information.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation in the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents were unable to even look at the health information or the recipes of the infants.
The situation was temporarily described as a correction in autumn 2016 for people under the age of 10 years.
Since then, the practices have been permitted to be corrected, but it has been astonishingly long time.
Now the correction is in place - in 2020.
As the problem is clear, the change of the legal base should not have been more than an auction.
Then the painting understands that the button is pressed: when the pipe is held, we open it.
Of course, the child can show his parents his information if he has a bank card or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is paid, and the banknotes are not even paid by 10 years old.
In practice, no one can see the data of the 4th grade school except by asking for it as printed.
It is not about the right of parents or the right of children.
It is extremely important for parents to be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right to privacy of teenagers must be cared for.
Even minors may have family situations in which they cannot be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is fundamentally relevant to human rights.
In the U.S., the FBI started to spoil the assault charges on Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will find out what at least two women are stalking.
One of the women had been consulted earlier this week by the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs.
Kavanaugh has disputed the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
The U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the senate's judiciary.
The investigation should not last for a week.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation of an unrestricted investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The attached smuggler continues to pull on the chamber.
The police say he's put a man in a police jail to "relax."
The police were attacked by the suspect on the night before Saturday in Kajaan.
The authorities will inform us of the case that started when a fair 30-sold man challenged a brutal fight at the central restaurant.
First, he was assaulted by another customer inside the nutrient movement.
This followed the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to step in, he hit him.
The trivial treatment led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police tell you.
The suspect still acted aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in his leg.
He threatened to kill and assassinate the cops.
The police say he's sent a man to the police jail to "relaunch."
The man is suspected of three assaults and of the violent opposition of the official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start working in Indonesia with Sulawes - "Fresh water is the most urgent"
The UN Children’s Organization Unicef and other international assistance organisations are ready to assist in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Finland’s information manager Unicef.
The local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activities, Unicef has always a full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please in Sulawes, rescue operations are under way, but the situation in the Donggala region is a little more inconclusive in the north.
There are still places to which connections do not work.
Assistance operations are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Buildings are often light-trained in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection, for example, for the first time, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are often able to offer water-cleaning tablets, which Unicef also has in storage.
Water systems are designed to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency case water is transported at first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Searching for family members and joining families is part of the Unicef mission field.
The World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN, is also organised by food assistance.
At the initial stage, emergency aid will be used with previously collected funds.
However, among other things, Unicef has already begun to collect money to assist the earthquake and the victims of tsunami in Indonesia.

Tesla's stock rate increased by more than ten per cent daily after twits, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his alleged financing.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock market with another management group or the company's government.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when the SEC declared a fraud prosecution.
It is expected to reinforcing the company's course in order to settle the news.
There is no reason for the last judgment
Of course, the watches of the Criminal Church do not ring when the wise ones do not move.
It's a technical defect.
The time of the Tower of the Principality of Helsinki has stopped.
The wise ones will show you at twelve.
It's like the average horror movie: even when the church crypta belongs to a maneuver and the urns spoil themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the time has stopped because of technical reasons: it has broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some of the parts have broken, and they're expecting a new part, says the suntio Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church is already mentioned in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence is not a reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church watches don't ring for fault.
