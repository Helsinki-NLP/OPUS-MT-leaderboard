The 28-year-old cook was found dead in the sanfranciscola shopping center
The 28-year-old cook just moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of the local shopping centre this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found in the Westfield Shopping Centre Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reported in San Francisco's Legal Medicine Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream work when he was released to San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant as a chef champion six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family, and we're sorry to be big," says the representative.
Our times are with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank first lived in hostels, but he finally had ordered his business.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was a nice, big-hearted one.
His way of being together with the family was to make food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the power.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was a grainless diamond that glorified every day," he says.
All of them are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department for a clue number 415-575-4444.
Insulting junior doctors demand new work fighting
The British junior doctors (which are mainly responsible for specialist doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new working activities in the dispute on the new employment contract.
The junior Medical Committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Union (BMA), is requesting support from the entire government for further combating activities from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA at the vote in July.
58% of the members who voted rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the Chairman of the Committee on Juniors, Ellen McCourt, published a letter sent to the members of the JDC in Twitter, where he says that the government has "speakingly" on the issues which McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter says: "In this light, the JDC Government has completely rejected the new proposal for a contract in its vote and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the Government of the BMA in which it asks permission to expand work since early September."
In view of the dispute, junior doctors have already been at strike six times this year, including the first complete recessions ever seen in the history of the UK public health system.
Mr Johann Malawana, head of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote, since he did not accept the negotiated terms recommended by the BMA.
Malawana told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be accepted, and 54 000 junior doctors and students of medicine were involved in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and that it would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: External Alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met in hand for reconciliation and to finalise the eight-month proverb and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish brothers in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties, yes, held hand,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't just squeeze the heat on his own defensive standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of Mr Putin, according to a report, five times.
I didn't keep the bills on my own.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
On the next day, one of our countries’ newspapers wrote Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm the opposite.
But the continuous grind of Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian battleplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was mad.
Putin attacked the hardest thing I said against Ankara and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was bigger than that because it came from the supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state took a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turkishs were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has forbidden the accusations.
However, the official message received from Peter was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only organised so that Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
So Russia could have some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a harsh truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled last month in a failure to take over the power.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as several million Russian tourists usually travel to the Turkish coast annually.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travel organisers and charter companies will certainly be relieved of relief when air transport can eventually be continued.
They're putting their faith in the explosion of the late season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And this week's state television has predicted the price of fruit and vegetables to fall when Turkey's imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"Turns there, tomatoes back here," was formulated by the Economic Journal of Vedemost in the article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
He's angry with the West because he thinks the West is silently responding to the attempt of the coup.
Without forgetting old anger about progressive Turkish EU membership negotiations and Putin's involvement in matters, Putin, who is eager to use cool spaces and crush Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coupling attempt.
This was self - clear to Moscow, who has been concerned about the exchange of power.
So Russia and Turkey could, at their top meeting in the pramean beach, pass on the picture described by an analyst as a "external alliance": two countries who experience becoming rejected and degraded, combine their powers.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major disagreements.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told us at a press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The Turkish President refusing to answer the question of disagreements in the countries, while Putin on the other hand stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State by Turkey in shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better, after months of open hostility, that these two Heads of State are again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland Banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Director-General of the RBS Bank, the bank’s activities outside Scotland are reduced in such a way that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the broadcaster BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the global objectives of the bank.
The bank had to retreat when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, brand-distrategics have used RBS to protect other consumer financial structures.
It sponsors millions of international sports, for example, the Six Nations Rugby and the Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to release more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but no RBS abbreviation will be used.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWests, with the exception of the main office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to the customers and staff in Inverness Shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS becomes an investment group and because of the work of our staff, because we are now becoming a much more bank of different brands.
Since the bank became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced its end to sponsoring the Six Nations Rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsoring.
"Now is the time to move into a bank containing different brands, because essentially the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's director.
"Three years ago, it would have been very choice if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put in place brands.
However, the work we have done and the focus on customer needs has changed a great deal rather than our own needs.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time."
Frankie Dettor was riding Predilection to win in the New Market and gaining 3,000.
After winning the champagne twice in a row in Newmarket, the dettor drove the champagne, which meant 3,000 to him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor secured its 3000 wins at the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This virstant column was achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this stadium on a flat track in competitions.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have been able to do the same.
The Triple Champion Jockey Dettori, who won earlier in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
It is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-life audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humiliation."
Dettor accepts the hurricanes with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a virstan barbecue competition, and they're the master jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-fold retired master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4 300 times his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4 493 winners
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys this time, and it's no surprise that he just reached this sausage, which has only few access to.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical prosperity is what distinguishes him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his cramp has brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that she would have won 6,000 races if she hadn't competed only during the weekends and just in big races!
In fact, Frankie's riding career in Great Britain has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been a great follow-up.
He's a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor flew his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping dripping down on his horse.
"Frankie Dettori has been an example of the British race for two decades.
There's been a lot of up and down.
He has won a number of major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the flight accident and has been in a competitive ban because of drug abuse.
When the ban of competition ended three years ago, he had difficulties to start, but he showed a marvelous strength of nature, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while, he is not going to end his career – Dettor has recently said that he wants to continue his race until he is at least 50 years old."
Putin was separated by Sergei Ivanov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, his Managing Director.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's credible interior for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin Communication, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no grounds for dismissal were stated.
Anton Vaino, Deputy Chief of Ivanov, since 2012.
Persecution, 44. He's a former diplomat.
In Tallinn, 1972, the persecution was completed from the Moscow National Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has worked in the Tokyo Embassy earlier.
Later, he led the president's protocol department and the government's office, reports the Russian website of Kremli.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making legislative drafts and monitoring the implementation of the instructions you have given."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusing in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and Putin has a KGB past.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state television, both said that Ivanov would retreat from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convincing only few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Has the result been fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the formal argument that a possible man praised as President would suddenly want to lead Russia's environmental policy.
On the Kremli website, Ivanov's words are presented to Putin, which says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult work for four years.
Now I have been the president's manager for four years and eight months."
Ivanov received the post in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB.
When Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replaced by the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
In time it was thought that Ivanovi might become President of Russia after Putin's second season, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another closest to Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became the Prime Minister, and then he returned to the president only three and a half years later.
The star of the Criminal Minds - FBI Researchers series Thomas Gibson was fired after the producer was fired.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, reported kicks in their joint communication.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened," she says in the press.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next FBI agents series, published later, is reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios newsletter.
Previously on the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54 years old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I hoped I'd see the show up to the end, but that's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the manuscripts, producers, actors, our great production group, and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped."
The 12th series of production period starts in the United States on 28 September.
Mysterious beaching of fish into the Banffin Garden
Kevin Bain, a resident in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish appearing in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have fallen into the earth as a storm.
Bain, living 500 metres from the seashore, published a picture material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five centimeters.
Queensferry's overflow is now connected to Fife.
A project of GBP 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have joined Queensferry's overseas on the north deck and on the bridge, which means that the bridge is now attached to Fife.
It is the first part of the four parts between the "national threats", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 cable ropes.
A project of GBP 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Mr Keith Brown, Minister of the House of Economics, visited the workplace today and was one of the first ones to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment for building Queensferry's bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and more than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used only to build this bridge.
Despite mass size and weight, building bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a discreet operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
There are now nearly 79% of the entire bridge, and the end of the deck is getting concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, Chief of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first bridge is always a significant urinary column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction sector.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and attached to the North Tower section, then we had to close the remainder of the northern (i.e. the countryside) block.
This was done by pulling 700 millimeters south of the north side of the bridge.
This was a massive operation and at the same time a major accuracy.
Massive because the ground is 222 metres long and weighing about 6 000 tonnes and was to be pulled up at a scale of about 3 per cent.
And a great precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — just a few millimeters.
It all went well fortunately."
Moelfre Bay's Rescue Department tells us about the surprise of three men.
Anglesey, in front of his fishing boat, three men on the water were saved like a miracle store.
Moelfre RNLI Maritime Rescue Station alerted on Friday at 13.20 a local time when the crew found an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued to go unreasonable without a director.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
By the time we got to the water, the strong winds were lucky to have transported a boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third one, 60 years old, was found exhausted with no lifeboats and no lifeboats.
They were all taken on board to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men on the water are still alive and perfectly fine.
There was an emergency shooter on the boat's engine, but for some reason, it had pulled off the boat when it crashed from the previous man.
"They were really lucky to be on their way."
Pokémon Go hunting brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but preferably stay inside to stare at their diamonds.
Pokémon Go makes people rise from the couch and move.
At first, the time of the screen was only taken by TV viewing, then came video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is great to note that technology and external movement do not exclude each other.
The Pokémon Go is a game application, the characters of which are from video games created in the 1990s (which were later made by drawing series, gambling cards and other accompanying products).
As many popular cultural phenomenons, this also stopped a little before the new game became available at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Lanseera in other countries was delayed because of the vast interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go went through Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for pokémons with their smartphones that are monitored by GPS. When you find the pokémon, it can be "lighted" (with a phone screening image) or "carbox".
It's been a sparkling generation who played video games when you were younger and raised the butts from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the average person per day.
Washington Post recently told us about the cardiogram application of the Apple Watch intelligence clock, which discovered within two days of the gambling, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know who the user plays Pokémon Go, sees only the raw data of the amount of exercises.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to rise from the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have emptied the deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have appeared to be unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
Regularly mobile patients are less likely to suffer from cancer or depression.
The exercise helps weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will bring about three basic things that support health — exercise, rait of air, and sun, and joy.
It is even possible to have new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes vicious cheerleaders.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
There's a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone applications such as Fitbit could have been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow the reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The news has disappeared, and the use is declining in time.
However, the success of the Pokémons will lead to more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise of people leaving and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a multiplayer match for women's tensions.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these people.
Dynamic jumps.
I don't want to be bothered.
The jaws are shaking on the butterfly.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympics winner.
On Thursday, an American 19 - year - old teline powerer won the championship of multi-game and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics lighthouse.
His total point 62.198 was clearly better than the "Final Five" teammate in Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze meitalist Aliya in Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the United States will be present at the end of the multi-competition of women's teline power competition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the summer Olympics on Thursday 2016.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time who won the championship of the multiplayer.
The party blew on tears when his financial's total points came to sight and his long path to this moment ended.
The achievement will take the species to the full new dimensions and raise him to the same class of sports other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
The party has been completely overwhelming in its species for the last three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes, that the 1984 Olympic winner, Mary Lou Retton, said he was "the greatest winner of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one last competition that took place, first and foremost, between the burden of Biles and his own and the overwhelming expectations, not even between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to the Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles in the United States (left) and Aly Raisman will hug after winning gold and silver in the individual competition of women's teline forces in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Rio 2016 in Summer Olympics. 11.8.2016
On Tuesday, the party won the first gold medal as a point on i, coordinating the country team and now retiring to Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles argued that he has never thought of anything in advance while he was at the top of his long time, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto programs, including his card-known voltage series, have been reconciled to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rion Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
As a child, his grandparents from adopting and finding his mother, Coach Aimee Boorman, have become a force character. Boorman found a girl when this was on a day care trip at the gymnastics hall where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe will probably continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two rounds, it was like a cloth.
There was a boom and a permanto, where Biles is a defending world champion.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points from the bottom, and he got the final result from the permano at 15.933 points.
Raisman gracefully hugged him when they waited for the final points — which was just formality — and the tears began to appear around the color of the red, white, and blue, sparkling color of Biles, when the dream that he once wrote in his clipbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rift for a four-year-old competition when he first shared a third place but then lost a bronze to Blackfina on a recurring round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call "Grandma" was clearly ahead of Blackfina.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto programme and thus became the winner of the loss position, which seemed unsure.
As for the party, this 19-year-old's earlier week and widespread tweet now has a whole new meaning:
The police say three music in the car as the victim of a serial killer who listened to it.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most destructive massacre for ten years, and the victims were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports the police report on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12th, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the streetside.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight guns and then escaped with another car, says the press release.
The police suspect that the third death was probably not a robbery because the attacker didn't take the bags and the 2,900 dollars were found in the second adult victim's hall.
Phoenix police reporter, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the death has been associated with four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been injured in nine attacks, mostly in Latin American areas within four months.
"It is common to the habits that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told CBS's subsidiary of the television and radio company KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where he later died because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died immediately at the scene of the event.
The eyewitness told the police that the triple was often sitting in the car to listen to music.
In addition, the police published a newsletter on the shooting on the open van empty, only half an hour before the triple death, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found shells and picked up a bullet from the car seat and a bullet in the engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old son with microchephalia: "Acts are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, their mother.
However, unlike most of the other age associates, Edmund has a microchephal, i.e. a congenital minority, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciutto’s genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I can't make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and his husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and may not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they suggested that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think such a practice was anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the roller.
Edmund rose up and started to sit up until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bike.
He's happy to play with his two brothers and love singing.
Elizabeth presents the sign that Edmund has invented, which means "laula to me."
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told the CBS News news.
However, it does not just mean a common sign language, but also includes the shorts that Edmund himself invented.
Microchephalia may have several different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund’s case, or congestive viral infections such as butterfly or zicavirus.
Symptoms and predictions vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the life of people with zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the insecure shock of the future.
"I kept taking care of what happens to us,
"what happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciut has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zikavirus.
"That's gonna make things better.
It's a habit of doing things.
"You love your child, and your child loves you."
Rainfalls and floods caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi States.
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana announced a state of emergency because of heavy fires and widespread floods, and more rains are expected to be in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East-Louisiana and South-Mississip flooded over their steams and spread to a wide area as a result of powerful heavy roads.
Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already on the way to flooding areas.
Reporter Mike Steele of the Governing Agency for National Security and Emergency reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only the Tangipahoa county has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday, most of the South Louisiana.
According to the Weather Service Communication, water may come further between 76 mm and 27 mm.
South Albania was given a flood warning on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite river near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weather predictor Alek Krautmann, many houses on the rivers can be flooded under the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding in the Ascension county constitutes a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly emptied into Lake Maurepas.
In Louisiana, Liverpool, the Tickfaw River flowing immediately south of the state of Mississippi, was already higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southern Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and granddaughter, were earlier on Friday close to the rescuers of Glosteria.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek river, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose fast during the night.
Another nephew near him had warned him.
"We rose up, and the water came with constant feed," Hansford says.
"It extended to my belt."
His wife had told Hansford that he had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years he lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he has himself and his family all injuries, and he himself is the only swim-skilled one of them.
Rescue workers had saved all three great military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were protected on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading to a wide extent when the heavy ignitions continue, and the authorities are already considering the evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information from the observer near Livingston, that it was almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was heavily watered after the rains that started Wednesday.
The authorities tell us that because of flooding heavy roads and streets, people in the Tangipahoa county had to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school circuits.
The member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told CBS’s subsidiary of the television and radio company WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
Robby Miller, director of the district, tells us that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained captives of the flood.
The evacuators have opened shelters for the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They can return to their homes when the water begins to retreat," he says.
In the town of Hammond, in the Tangipahoa county, nearly twenty streets were to be closed because of the flooding, and people were offered sand tacks to prevent water from entering their homes and their premises.
"For the last time, we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, member of the city government.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rain continued evenly on the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, Head of Rescue in Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that Thursday, there was a report of a large-scale house under the flood, but on Friday, no one had come to the record so far.
Keith Townson, Chief of Shopper Value Foods, tells me that he lived in Amite for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets in his body, 6 years of age, Mahaj Brown, survives the Philadelphia shooting scene
According to the police, Philadelphia has been shot by a 6-year-old boy who's already another 6-year-old who's been shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child said on the CBS Philadelphia channel the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several shooting wounds in the veins, legs, arms and stomachs, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his son's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in a critical state in the hospital, and he has had several surgery.
The family tells the television company that they think he's gonna make it.
He was in the first class at the local high school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown City.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted.
The second 29-year-old status was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found at the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical state.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are now examining whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Police scientists told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The site was full of assault-type shells, which originated from different assault weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing battle.
On the street, there were shells on both sides of the walk.
There have been several armed fighters in place, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," told the television station, Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the region.
There's no arrests, and the police have heard that they're going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was hit by a misguided bullet when he played on Tuesday at his home in the city of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I call the Olympic Team of Women's Winter Powers, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been as superfluous as it is now.
Secondly, three of this team's winners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have been inspired by many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisma and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female leader has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were located at 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner for the races, and the whole America hurried.
Now the world has been able to prove the unbelievable performances of the world champion Simone Biles, Douglasi and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and surprising works of art.
On Thursday, Simone became a fourth consecutive American who won gold in the multi-competition of women.
The teammate, Aly Raisman, won silver.
Such visions are at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be seen in teline power classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to make a Olympic team.
They are the last five (Final Five), because the next Olympic team will have only four victors, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that teline power is a precious sport and the gymnastics are mainly practiced in private teline powering euros that are maintained by their parents. The parents pay for training costs, facilities, travel, performance cost, competition fees, hotel fees (coachers, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The state of most teline powered euros is located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The teaching of the power stations takes place in these series, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Coach of Simone Biles Aimee Boorman and Coach of Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Haney, have both trained the sports enthusiasms since they started the rolling force.
We need to organise a cheaper and better available teline strength education for many of the young girls who have been attracted by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own teline power fund 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for over 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities in my hometown to Detroit to offer high quality teline power for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
The power, stiffness and body coordination are developed and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings the lasting benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has attracted the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start a teline force, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madiso for the real "girl power" you showed when you win the Olympic Gold, and for motiving so many young girls from their backgrounds to start on their roads as well, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for the new strikes.
Ministers wished to resolve the dispute on the changes to the remuneration and working conditions by accepting the renewed contract with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, voted against the proposal.
In July, Minister Hunt told us about the plans to make the agreement obligatory and said that the UK Public Health System (NHS) is "no one country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that includes changes to the practice of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in unsocial times.
Mr McCourt, chairman of the BMA’s junior veterinarian committee, gave yesterday an opinion saying: "Junior doctors continue to take a very prepared view of the proposed agreement, particularly as a fear that it is accelerating the current labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new treaty, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been unwilling to deal with the discussions, and sometimes not even reacting in any way.
I saw it even though Jeremy Hunt made last month a promise that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, revoke the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, the junior doctors are ready for the new fight measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to help strike doctors.
Ministers hoped that the dispute on the changes would be finalised by a renewed agreement with the staff of the British Medical Union.
The Association of Applied Sciences BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors that would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director of the NHS's employees, appealed to junior doctors so that they would not take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Working activities achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services that are already on the extreme borders and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances for patients, medical staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the junior committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the revealing of irregularities.
Employers were hoping that the continued commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility of education, further training from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, education and gender pay gaps in the treatment sector – was a sign of the seriousness of workers, health education in charge of health education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that pays approximately €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are receiving some €2.40 per day when the authorities recommended that they be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anticoagulant tikagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with cardiac disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after the heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to increase the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (NHS) is advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack annually, of whom a quarter of whom recur or get strokes.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance accumulating into the walls of the blood vessels that produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from getting into the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can pass along the bloodstream and prevent the blood flow into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have had a heart attack.
The British AstraZeneca produced by the ticagrelor, which is sold in the name of Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulps.
The draft NICE Guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, then reduce the dose to 60 mg and also administer aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson (NICE), Professor Carole Longson, says: "Even though there are effective methods to prevent disease progression and symptoms effectively, even a quarter of those who have had heart attacks, there is a new seizure or stroke – often fatal consequences.
Fear of recurring can have a very negative effect on the quality of human life.
We have received evidence that the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack will be effectively reduced in combination with aspirin.
The recommendation on the temporary use of tikagrelor will increase treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially for the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the vote banner in the Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes from a wide-ranging electoral villa in Muslim communities, revealing the government report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of the Government, strongly criticises the police, election observers and city delegations about their obsession with the electoral heritage 'for the sake of ethnicity and religion'.
According to Mr Pickles, as former Minister of Regional Administration and as the current anti-corruption force character, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to create guard chains outside the voting places to protect the feared voters.
He proposes that the electoral authorities present an identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At present, the voter should only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be baptized in an unsustainable posture after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says, more protection should take place.
He calls for suppliers to have access to the Council of State documents and to improve the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent elections, but also to combat fraud against corruption and economic interests and the popular culture in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal of the East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered Mayor Lutfur Rahman to resign from his duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman was “a misleading” the religious emotion of his Muslim community, and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rahman was said to use his campaign as the basis for the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questioned or given sincerely by making a vote to another person.
Sir Eric says that evidence of sincereness was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal electoral shell, where the Muslim community's senior members were told to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) has put forward a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the request for an identity certificate at the voting site.
The report says: "There is evidence that some members of the vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, in particular in the background communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the government institutions had closed their eyes from such activities because of the "politically sound" susceptibility to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to cool the system, including the prohibition of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'recording votes'.
Theresa May's report also calls for more stringent checks in relation to registration in order to prevent the use of the record of voting rights for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consideration of alternatives which would require voters to present a identity certificate before voting.
Baptizing fingers in an unsuccessful mushroom after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic audits to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal vote.
Prohibition of the processing of voices and mail mail envelopes sent by the completed mail from political activists.
The police have the right to set up security chains around the voting points.
Modification of the law by making it easier to raise intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at voting places.
Only allowing English in the voting places (except Wales).
Improvement of training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person at a time is allowed to go to the voting copy.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and thinks it's "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlet case, no criminal charges were raised.
"The Electoral Court distinguished Lutfur Rahman and his representative from the task of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without any suspicion, and the criminal evidence threshold was crossed on a number of grounds."
He also criticises the ineffective "criminatory checks" of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The decision taken by the Court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation threatens the worrying and hidden electoral wreckage of some people and its denial."
The Similarity of the Olympic Biker with Duchess Catherine and the other dual creatures in the Rio Olympics
The Rio 2016 Olympic fans were wild this week from a French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose similarity with the Princess of Cambridge is amazing.
But the discussions in the social media show that this 24-year-old Olympic Advocate is not the only athlete fighting the championship with a similarity with a well-known person.
In our sights of Rio's races and all the flirting well-known faces FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose similarity with Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: the US men's Flexible Team Brady Ellisonia (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Duchess Catherine's double being seen on bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one of them could be an actress Leonardo DiCaprio's double brother.
The U.S. Men's Fleet Team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm after the pictures of him published on Twitter, where he is strikingly resembled the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard of DiCaprio since he was a child.
"I don't see the likeness of the world that is so big, but maybe a beard and a mustache," said Brady Huffington to Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the London competitions in 2012, the British long-term jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were targeted, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these races.
Aliya Mustafina, a great-eyed Russian actor, has been called Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with Matthew Morrison from the Glee TV series for years.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is a "athetic version" of the Inception film actress.
Similarly, for a long time, the similarity between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actress Josh Hartnett has been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The silver amateur of the swimming, the Russian Yulia Efimova, reminds an actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of his beautiful brown skin and light hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian is a "athetic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt" according to his fans.
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (also), remind each other of their faces and eyes.
It is not only: this Twitter user was pleased when others also saw a similarity.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for a pair of similarities.
A tweeter recently expressed his delight in "other people on the Internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's coherence".
The U.S. football star and the Dexter-series actress really remind each other of their faces and faces.
Many have also noticed the likeness of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and an actress Laura Linney's smile and the winning winner of gold, Gabby Douglasi and Anna come back!
The Olympic Commander of the CBC asks for an apology after the Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
The analysis of Byron MacDonalds from the fourth Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, was shocked by the CBC’s direct Olympic Report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost scents" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to start launching his own opinions at the end of the final of the Women's 4 x 200 metre free swim message.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's explanatory panels to bring color, was said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went on speed and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 swims at the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1,61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, allowing the Canadians to swim China.
Viewers around Canada react rapidly after shocking the voice and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig??
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on the shipment."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the final of the 4 x 200 metres free swimming message: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with rageful Byron MacDonald's criticisms, and many demanded his dismissal.
Twitchers didn't arrest their words when they heard how irrelevant Byron Macdonald was.
"Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, hosting the CBC's mission, quickly apologised MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the floating order.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
In the end, CBC had to regret more than 90 times the people who tweeted the comment.
The commentary colleague, Scott Russel, had to apologise for MacDonald.
After this, the CBC copied and affirmed his apologies to more than 90 other tweeters’ comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly submitted a public apology request.
"We are sincerely sorry about these statements and that they have been sent.
We asked our viewers for an apology in yesterday's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not personally to him.
However, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald announced his apology in the broadcast and tried to defend his speeches by saying that it wasn't personal.
"I want to apologize for my comments that I made last night after women's communications," said MacDonald at the CBC Olympics.
"I put a swimmer on performance, not a person.
Not to mention, it is clear that I did not mean anything to be despised by my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, prevented underwear in the middle of trade, the woman shocked customers
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to make up her underpants.
He further worsened the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off his feet and putting them back in the shelf.
He continued to circumvent and eventually tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
Primark chain store at Folkestone Bouverie Place, where a woman tried panties in front of everyone and put them back in a shell.
At the same time in the store, two children's mothers Jenny Davidson tells us that after experimenting with underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says about what happened, "The people weren't gonna believe in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off her shelf, took her own trickets and her underwear and put them on.
He did not try to do it unacceptablely, but did it completely unsatisfactory.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he tested and apparently didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it again three times before he finally decided not to like them, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes — and he didn't think of a person who would finally buy his underpants that he had made."
The 33-year-old Davidson in Kent town continues, "How disgusting to think that someone takes his home underwear that someone else has used and has not been washed."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the trade staff sought to remove these pieces of clothing when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underpants home and notice that someone else has come to them without being washed afterwards," adds Davidson.
The reporter of Primark commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from the sale."
This is how you defend yourself against armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the New York Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Union and asked him how to cope with a robbery or assassin in the near future.
The video will show you how to defend yourself against the attacker, whether the attacker approaches you in front of or behind.
If the attacker approaches backwards, first, we have to turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
After this, grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and hit the attacker on your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knees, and when he goes from pain to double coefficients, slap him in the face with a gun pipe and retreat by keeping a gun directed to him.
The technology is similar if an armed assailant approaches the front, and you need to move away from the firing line, grab the gun and turn it around so that the attacker can't launch.
At the same time, put your pressure on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and hold the gun targeted to the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by handing out your cash — unless you are the Grand Master of Krav Maga.
World traveler Ian Wright, who makes a travel guide, licks the dirtyest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and reflex into the hard test by licking the dirtyest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk leader and traveller Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove their resistance by licking euro banknotes, handhelds in Piccadilly Circus, train toilet rinse and Russian public phone.
Before arrowing, Wright measured the targets with a luminary meter to see and show the viewers where the language was pushing.
The test was made by a documentary film Ian Wright – after the internal force, and its results were surprised.
The idea of rinseing the toilet can be disgusting, but in fact there are more bacteria in the kitchen.
Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals in various parts of Europe to strengthen the good intestine bacteria and to their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he arrowed did cause nothing but a bad taste of mouth.
Ian Wright was first known for his traveling program, where he tested the endurance of his bowel by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of the rinse barrels and the toilet washing sticker of the railway stations challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document, "I've been rather careless about my health since I was a child, and I've put in my mouth all kinds of things like soil, worms and torches."
In the movie, he really showed himself to be taxable to his reputation.
The border came against only in a fragile general bathroom in Russia.
The luminaire measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
Due to comparison, it should be reported that the number in the re-washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian general bathroom, where Wright refused to arrow when the luminaire measured 4000 units — the same number in retarded hands is less than 60.
Wright is adventured together with Valio in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright – an internal force where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4000 units, nothing dirtyer than that!
It's so disgusting that I'm definitely not licking anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film with Ian Wright – internal power in collaboration with Valio.
From the election Wright, she received a selecto Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacteria and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category of snack, juice and extraction products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something fascinating to look at and, at the same time, tells us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking something crazy, and finally we ended up in the idea of asking Ia."
The health of the salt has become a world-wide trend.
"We wanted to bring them in a broader context rather than just talking about products and tell them about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the salt has become a global trend, and the document enables us to provide more information to consumers in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, the director of the film, adds to this: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain objects we requested, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Of course, kissing some objects was easier for Ian, while some were rather bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In the 2015 Valio survey, 84% of respondents joined lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the abdominal and intestinal tissue and 58% reported that at least occasionally used products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The morgue family destroyed the rent house owned by the city in Saltash, Cornwall.
The disgrace family left the damage of GBP 50,000 in the rent house owned by the city after they had been expelled from the neighbourhood for terrorism.
Tanya Skeldo and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been expelled from his apartment in Cornwall Saltash, after complaints against many couples.
When the couple was forced to withdraw from the apartment, the dwelling company's representatives found that the apartment was shocked to be in renovation.
There were slamming holes in the walls, the floorboards had been torn off, the garbage was spread on the floors and the walls were graffitied.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing (Cornwall Housing), says he fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to tolerate this.
There is a lot to weigh, as the property is likely to be not so pleasing as part of Cornwall.
"Family is notorious, as is its name."
The Parish had three boys who lived in the apartment at times, and according to the police, the family had street fights in the field of baseball, the scare of neighbouring people, the use of drugs and the mediation of drugs, and loud screaming, fighting and cursed.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received an order for non-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the crash.
Drugs had been sold from the house before, and the floorboards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
Cornwall's office evicted the couple with forced forces this week after giving them 11 weeks of additional time to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the expulsion — they said their lives were earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living in their neighbor for 20 years, and the whole time has been hard.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It'll be wonderful now that they've finally been expelled."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Director of the Cornwall Living Office, says that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
Waste and old toys had been thrown on a wild wall in the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, because expelling is always the last measure that Cornwall's apartment agency is considering.
This case was extremely difficult because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my group, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and boldly offered us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the welfare of the neighbours and give a message that non-social behaviour is not accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment in different times, but they were already in twenty.
The filthy mattress found in one bedroom after the wedding
The residential workers now need to clean out the waste bags surrounding the house.
The police made an apartment in 2014 riding and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and in addition to weights and other supplies as well as 1 700 quid of cash.
Skeldon was punished when he was found guilty of the possession of class B drug in order to sell it.
He claimed that the money was his car accident in 2013 for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard to move into a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were wasted with graffiti.
The police say they need an expulsion for the tenants who violate the rules of the lease contracts.
From Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police, this expulsion is a clear warning for renters who are constantly undermining the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want to be without prosecutions, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," Crow says.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never accept criminal and social behaviour and continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beached military drill jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal's Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed to a blurring low.
According to the air forces, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced to escape when a low-flighted drill drill crashed across the full shore.
The dramatic images show how a military plane will be approaching almost the distance of a sandband from tourists taking sun in the Aveiro of Northern Portugal.
The vacationers got up in their feet as they were concerned, understandably, about the glimpse of the drill engines that began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographs of a dramatic flight and videos of social media holidays was Daniel Fernandes, saying: "It passed the beach twice very low, and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall on the ground."
Nunno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly came to sight and flew at an alarmingly low level.
Portugal's Air Forces today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion machine was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke caused by nearby forest fires was impaired by visibility, but according to the air forces, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the continental Portugal and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air forces today announced that due to the low visibility of the bucket and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The first half of exote is better than expected
The South Karelia social and health district (Eksote) made a better outcome in January - EUR 3.4 million in June.
The exote’s result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Exote is trying this year to shorten the lines of action.
The excess covers the previously resulting deficit.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and buy measures for patients.
The result of the year as a whole is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the six-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special boundaries sworn in Immola
Seventy-seven armies at the Border and Maritime Guard have sworn a military oath on Friday.
Military elections were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Range Course was held in the Army Sports Field.
A soldier's oath swore about 70 armies.
Special border guards are trained for required border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, he applied for 310 young people as a special boundary.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special borders have been trained in Immola since 2007.
There were five veterans involved during the war with the trains of the border forces during the event.
The middle age of those with them is now 90 years.
The elders were born in 1918.
A lot of thieves ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police departments in Finland have been a RTA, the Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwards invisible.
In Hämeen Police Department, the unit comprises four policemen in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant in the Bay.
Inspector General, he's Inspector Lahde.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civil suit.
The unit has shown its fitness and need, looks at Deputy Chief of Police, Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will produce different reports to the other police.
In the ambush, it has acquired information on asylum seekers, among other things.
Reform of the most recent working practices
Establishing analytical units is the latest reform of police practice.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would go on more and more often, only when they get an alarm.
With the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
In addition to the reform of the police administration, a country was established by a Criminal Intelligence Centre, less than three national units, and to each police department its own Criminal Intelligence Unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Criminal Police runs national activities.
In PTR units, people from Police, Customs and Border Guard work as their name.
The RTA departments, in turn, work in areas shared by police departments and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national departments.
Inquiry extends beyond its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, as crime does.
Those working at the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, alerts databases and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the factor is formed by a certain image.
Frequency may be carried out either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The staff of the RTA unit do not walk the necks up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Both the methods used by criminals and their own methods are not reported because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus to prevent police offences.
The method is publicly reported by the police if it expects them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was news from the early summer, the way in which the apartments used to be vacant in the housebreaks were labelled.
In that way, the authors put a stick, a needle or a piece of tape on the outside door of the apartment, which they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
Pre-examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analytical unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning about their mistakes.
The smartest are ordering a record of the law, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, the thieves are left with gloves in hand.
For the purpose of the case, an interview has been received from Tero Seppasta Hämeen Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepolaa from the Itä-Suomen Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from Central Criminal Police.
The police are collecting and analysing information to design practical activities.
In the context of a reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside of its own institution and Finland’s borders.
A London school girl associated with fathers was killed in Syria
News tells us that one of the three British schools that joined Daddy last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee tells her family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the Isis base in Syria, reported on Thursday, the ITV News.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to his family, he was just planning to flee from the country of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will act as a warning example and will, so that people can see this as a real risk when going to the war zone - and who will make people give up their decision," says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 together with two other Eastern London schoolgirls to a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis fighter in Syria and had been widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's name for the Supreme Court if he is elected.
The Senate's Democrat Director, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the candidate Hillary Clinton of the Democrats will appoint Merrick Garland as judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected as President.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland’s appointment since Barack Obama was appointed in March.
According to Mitch McConnell, the majority director of the Senate, the next president will choose the person to fill the position of Antoni Scalia, the Supreme Court judge.
Reid said at a phone conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with great certainty."
Reid's reporter later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether this would name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "build the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Appeal of the United States in the District of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans who prevent Garland's name are the Presidential candidate Donald Trump's "management" and "authors".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and brings on the market a calendar made in the 1970s style and inspired by Pirell in 2017.
Instead of credentials, they want to find the best models of the next generation of their NU Muses calendar in 2017.
The CEO of Treatsin, Steve Shaw, earlier this year, told me that his naked magazine is different from the Playboy magazines of the old school, because he said, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same way about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classical nakedness, where women, wherever men are, can not bother to enjoy and inspire these women's images of praise," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure women want to participate in this project because it's gonna be a beautiful work of art."
As a model for the calendar, they want to send their images via the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl attraction: Who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on your anger's objection with a name sign No.AllUniversalsKeski-Age Menhet, this argument is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is no millennium-generation bum behind the new arrival of much spoken vinyl plates, while the millennials want to know the physical object in their hands, but instead there is nostalgia in the background of the Middle Ages.
The age of the person who bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group 18-24 is the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of the enthusiasts to hug discs, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl plate buyers are likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been televised on the news, the camera would follow me by walking through a lively Soho Street, a gray jacket on my head. I'd be gently stirring my hand into a cup, and I'd say something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its attractiveness and stainlessness, while the hotels, the Eats, the Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still large-scale special plate stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I seek very close men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and nature.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray movement (as customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (as customers at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London for afternoon and spends extra time by examining the supply of shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These records fill the wall of his living room, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so much albums and singles is partly in his available income. He now has the ability to buy records for which he could not afford when they appeared in the beginning, and to buy again things that he had to sell when he was young and without money.
"I did a lot of cases in the late '60s and the early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," she says.
He agrees that the buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my worst."
Wez, 25, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers are suitable for Yougov profile.
However, he has found a new kind of human flow that has been influenced by media hypnotism, and these people have heard about the return of vinyl plates and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain a certain age of vinyl regeneration buum.
What about the alleged emotional meaning of audio records?
In just a few seconds, a movement such as Phonica realizes that they provide comfort to similar types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly upset about the unresponsive payment system.
The digital world may haunt some vinyl fans, to whom return to familiar disk boxes means persistence and resemble the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or a material property as some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts out."
"We're like social workers." Wez's workmate out behind the plate pie.
The ICM review in April revealed that almost 50% of the vinyl album purchased in the previous month had not yet listened to their disc.
The opinion study also reported that 41% of the record player is never using, and 7% of the buyers of the vinyl disk have no own record player.
At this stage, I'd probably show a serious face while I look at the stainless bossa nova collections.
The future of the vinyl plates is also associated with the "pocal phenomenon", which has been observed by Jonny, 42 vendors of the Sound of the Universe (as customers at the moment three middle-aged men).
"One customer recently came to the store and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it in his shelf," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not great, but there are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not parents, mostly teenagers who are just about to start hobbying."
The customer community is much more varied in Foppi, to which I will be next. The business has owned a whole layer of vinyl plates.
Customers have seventy-year-old couples, photography tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The difference between customers is delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: the most recent synthetic poop of Wild Beasts, instead of the glowing jazz.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to find a sharp psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes and watched various discount plates.
He's looking more than doing shopping.
He tells us that his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They pay a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the slice is ...", he lets lovely thrust and continue:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping pharmaceuticals, but they're gathering for a moment around Polaroid cameras, and I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left, there is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of modern music and classics, key records to any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decorative element and a part so high that they're not even reached.
They're pure "art vinyl" dressing.
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money to the sector and send a few customers to the search for Sohoo, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population with more time and money than most people is also the group that uses the most money for luxuries, such as vinyl albums.
Although my research indicates that YouGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
I'm sure they don't spend their Thursday morning in the Berwick Street record shops, Browse records and avoid a 30-year-old who stares scary and stares at unforeseen middle-aged men.
The holker or ice shark is the longest live spine — a video report
According to researchers, the longest live spine on the earth is ice shark.
According to Scientist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice sharks were spent age in the study of 272 to 512 years.
The French court rejected the application for the abolition of the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the application by the Calais authorities in which they have requested the decommissioning of dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in thousands of refugees in the jungle camp.
At this week's trial, Calais's authorities argued that the State should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary trades on the refugee camp, which sells different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts.
According to Calais’s practitioners, these trades and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, since the free meals offered by the State-sponsored organization and other bodies are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal justification for expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but he thought that Calais's practitioner was concerned as "fullly understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s food shops, cafés and restaurants have a much greater meaning than providing food for people who live in extremely insecure conditions.
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the sites below the decommissioning was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of uncareable minors who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed the address where the children’s cafe is required to be kept.
According to the letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrant, have assessed on Friday that since the sharp growth of the summer arrivals, the number of inhabitants of the jungle camp has risen to a record of more than 9 000 lives.
The price of food in Finland falls clearly faster than in the EU average
Food is cheaper in Finland for consumers and for producers to be harmed.
In Finland, food prices have decreased by almost 5 per cent in three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen to second most in Finland in EU countries with a level of wages similar to Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is reflected in the article published in the Information & Trendit blog, Head of Statistics Finland's Development Ilkka Lehtisen.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which have been proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are this year's June.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices were down close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed a translation, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the price is weighed by Russian bans on imports of food which have suppressed food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer with a short target," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the decrease in prices.
The large trading chains of the S group and Kesko have both reduced their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as the most visible advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost diet, even though the price of food has fallen largely.
In 2015, food was in Finland the fourth most expensive EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food to be sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that, if the comparative countries had the same rate of VAT, in Finland, thirdly sold the lowest food from the same countries.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparative countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to old EU levels at the price of food, VAT must be halfway to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete with prices," Lehtinen writes.
The report points out that the calculations made by him at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same.
One returning to the school bench may notice that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is the instruction that all schools in Finland are operated.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells us the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old instructions.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty works is abandoned, and instead, the schools are being trained on the coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read by four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
In the past, it was thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's long-term spine was found. The ice shark could live for up to 400 years.
The known grenade shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches the maturity of the family only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in today’s world.
In the animal, it only passes the Islamic herb whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks are floating along North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females delay dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five feet.
As growth is slow, according to associations, only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the ice sharks of adults from 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio silicon release of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks investigated was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish of the sample, amazons of 493 and 502 cents, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that glaciers reach only four metres of maturation, researchers declined to be about 150 years of age at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann's fire to almost 300 - the sellers will not be reduced.
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from the stockman company.
The cooperative companies in the company in which they were in trouble ended at the beginning of August.
"At the result of the negotiation, approximately 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are being made redundant," says Stockmann in his communication.
According to this, the number of sellers in the commodity sector is not reduced in order to ensure that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as a vendor.
Stockmann's yt-negotiations were about 3 000 employees.
At the start of these, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining profitable from the store.
Although the adjusted business result of the group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, commodity stores are still losing.
According to Stockmann v CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in commodities have not reached the company's objectives.
Unfortunately, the reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive business results are achieved in 2018," says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was based, in particular, on the Lindex's good success in the clothing chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results for the best second quarter of all time.
The operating profit of the Lindex increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that this year's turnover will be reduced last year.
The corrected business results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rain in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, reports the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
The middle parts of the country also have rainbows, but southern is from the pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, because the mercury in the whole country remains less than 20 degrees.
The northern rain zones remain at 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenya general sports team is shaken by a strange explanation for the dopingskandaal - coach’s temper
The Kenya general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home to the Olympics at the Rio after it turned out that Anzrah played as a sportsman in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that an athlete when Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-foot star of Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, part of the Kenya League Team, told us that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a surprise test sample as Rotichina.
Doping officials came to announce the Anzrah authorities.
According to the Soin, Anzrah was sent home because he was "a crime against Kenya's country team."
He played as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", the Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on the other hand, rode the news office for Reuters.
The Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich will run immediately.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich took place last year in MM races on the way to the fourth and is preliminary to Rio’s winner recommendations.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's Athletic Team claimed that Anzrah traveled with an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race pool.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was tested.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Sports Stadium is diminishing its vacuumity
Where is everybody?
At least, at the Olympic Stadium of Rio, they aren't following sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top individuals were able to show their skills confusing to an empty viewer.
On Friday, Rio’s organisers told us that only 58% of the first-day morning race tickets and 65% of the night race tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium sang out of the hurrage.
The final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
Rio’s Olympics has already attracted attention before the sports.
For example, thousands of empty seats have appeared in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 people’s viewpoint was filled.
At least the bad move explains the fact that Brazil, who struggled with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian contestants, and many of the Olympic species are strange for the used Brazilians in football.
Even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not be filled with football stadium.
Mario Andrada, journalist of competition directors, during the weekend, told us that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
From the 8,5 million Olympics in London, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics in London, Volunteers and Army staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have provided 240 000 tickets to schoolers in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
With Rio stadium, there were plenty of vacancies in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in the sand of Copacaba has not been of interest to the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
There's a lot of people in the papers.
New way of protecting nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the protection of nature by means of new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
Afterwards, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders with money in the territory of the country.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The country is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by willing persons against the payment of the right of holders.
The holder shall receive a right of veto in its 187 square block, which in practice means that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is intended to be changed.
The rights of holders can also be acquired for several segments.
Acquisition of administrative law is something concrete that can be left as a heritage or gift.
There is no need to go and carry bands or shackle itself somewhere to protect nature," the Juha Leviäkangas, who acquires the right to control his company, justifies.
The managing authority receives accurate location information from its section, which enables visits, for example, in the block.
The names of the owners of rights acquired on the Foundation’s website are handsome in the same map as the country’s block data.
The only risk that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea is its nature protection procurement.
The Helsinki Foundation is established as a general interest foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
It is a risk that the Foundation would act in some way in an unethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and calm.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more defence countries.
It also aims outside the Finnish borders and plans to land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Shop on August 13-19.
The bike thieves torture the biggest cities of Turku - look at the situation of your municipality.
Bicycle thieves torture Turku at the worst of the great cities in Finland.
In this year, more wheels than nine other major cities have been stolen in proportion to the population.
Helsinki Sanomat explained on the basis of the bike thievings reported to the police, the amount of bicycles and parts thereof have been stolen in ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, four to five bikes were stolen per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two cycling thieves were notified to the Espoo and Kouvola police for a thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thieves occurs in proportion to the population compared to others," characterises police inspector Tommi Ree of the police government.
Turku's police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of security can be influenced by how much the city moves with wheels and how much wheels are at the top," thinks Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise at the top.
The number of bicycle thievings goes largely according to what are study and bicycle shops.
There is a close centre in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where the city centres are distant and the bike is not necessarily a priority tool," Reen says.
In Finland as a whole, the police have become a little less cycling thieves than during the previous year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police learn a little more than 20 000 cycling thieves every year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime report on cycling, although less than every ten cases reported to the police will be found.
Typical solved cycling is where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in their blood.
"There will also be cases in the context of other investigations when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught on a weekly basis or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He believes that wheels are stolen, for example, from the market centres’ wheels, indoor yards, warehouses and bike watches, which is practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
The number of individual bike models is most stolen in the past years, like Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other kinds of locks.
For example, some thieves take a bike for their short-term use, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up in sales, for example through the Internet.
They're staying on the domestic market.
"Of course, the police have not come to know that stolen wheels would go much abroad," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finnish.
Some of them must buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be committed to a concealing crime or a violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if good-looking bikes are sold at the lowest price," says Reen.
Sever Hirvi, a special library official, always wears a colorful Nopsan for his working day to cover the library in Helsinki.
The wheels he's had five copies, but none of them have been stolen, the monster says. "It's never been taken, it's been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may be no hipsterial value here," the Helsinkian Monster wonders.
Movei Valve, a quick dealer in Helsinki's Kallio Kioski, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike beat the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike into something solid, like a wheelchair.
"Because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student of his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"Oh, all the time, the friends hear that the wheels have been stolen."
"Most bad wheels, that kind of ugly Jops."
They stole a bike from their guards a year ago from the housekeeper's inner courtyard.
Although the bike had been unlocked, Valve could expect it to be clogged.
The under 15-year-olds in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peers familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer review team is being attempted to prevent young people from entering the crime round.
At first, the experiment will be applied to people under the age of 15 who are now under criminal liability.
The comparator board is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer board will discuss what has happened with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender may be able to join the peer crew in order to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"Everything guides a young person in a more responsible direction so that everything does not ruin the first mistake," says the Institute.
The model of the United States has been taken into account by the comparative lighting crew, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not go before the adult panel, but reflects what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service formator of Palmu Iikka Lovio, who followed the test, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences of people under the age of 15 have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message to keep on the road you choose," Lovio says.
The Comparative Lighting Team is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youth, based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio underlines that new ways of action are offered to all those who need it, not just for young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican agents want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
It is said that more than 70 powerful Republicans have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
From the letter, the U.S. Journal Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
Signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his carelessness, incompetence and recording discomfort threaten to bring to the Democrats in these elections a belt," says the letter Politico.
Only direct orientation of all possible funds to congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing on a day-to-day basis.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the officials of the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposed Trum.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "from people who want a party to protect its majority in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions of Donald Trump, believed to have offended millions of voters.
It is also said that he has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously on this week, 50 officials working on national security reported in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton permits relief for American children's families
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, candidate for the President of the Democrats, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president in order for the economy to go well for him and his friends," said Clinton in his speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part through rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handicraft for American duunars who suffer after the factories move into the lands of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay the tax of departure, Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages", said Clinton.
According to the speculations published before the Washington Post, Clinton intends to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "only favours millionaires like this".
Trump's suggested discount on corporate taxes has previously been appointed by Clinton "Trump's pork hole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton drove.
These are Rio’s audiences: The cats have not glued Finnishs to the squares, but mobile applets are interesting
Usually, the sports races appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tops.
Rio’s Olympics have so far not reached the vast number of viewers.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the edge of the squares: Tuesday night’s swimming was followed by the Top Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time 615 000 viewers.
Due to comparison: the month-on-month general sports EM races received nearly 800 000 watches at TV2 at the same time, and the EM football races were fairly another million.
For the time being, the most interested in the Olympic Games have been the Sunday night biking and the fifth race day opening a tennis gymnastics that reached the Olympic Channel at the same time nearly half a million viewers.
Yle sports leader Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience numbers, and reminds us that the audiences are divided in the Rio Olympics for the first time in a number of different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnishs are following the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with the large number of TV viewers who choose the Olympics.
Even on the TV side, the viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics are the first sports races to which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all over the time 20 000 to 50,000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than the 2012 London competitions or the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference is explained by the difference in time - a large part of Rio’s races will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the dim interest - if someone thinks it's dim - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the first races to a surprise medal, interest would have come up with it.
In addition, general sport is just about to start, as are other Finns interested species: sailing and riding.
The initial viewers have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkise.
When athlete begins, the number of audiences explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile application, which rose up in the first days of the races at Applen App Store, became the most charged free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"The counts of the blood will only be later." Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users, as hoped.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems at the initial stage.
Applications have obtained updated versions that should correct errors.
Rio’s Olympics will be seen more widely on Top's channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and the Yle Talk is on the radio to pass the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the workplaces for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports can be seen on both Top and Commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Ristinsel.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, an engineering sub-trainer, found about 20 square metres in the Ristisel, with a bottom depth of 104 metres.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to inevitably strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not necessarily be found in a small deepened hundred metres, says developing engineer Jari Hakala.
So until now, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Second Water and Main Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sun Lake.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake hasn't been carefully scanned.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is determined by the mid depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
With this in mind, your sun will not get into the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvesi is still farther from the top.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14.29: The last copy corrected with the deepest lakes in the middle was wrong.
From the Irish tax base: Taxation of pensioners is increasingly tighter
Retirement taxation remains more stringent than employees.
The admirer says that an inconvenience occurred under the parliamentary elections and the tax of pensioners was promised to be equal to the employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received work income reductions, which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the issue warmed up the representatives of the opposition, who swept out of the election promises of the Minister for Finance at the time, Alexander Stubb.
Buying power will be secured, it will not grow
In the guidelines presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.), the tax reductions are mainly due to safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
The admirer is pleased by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo's messages for the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done with the strength of the social partners, so it should not be struggled by questioning.
It will be needed because the economy is so much at the expense of domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
Inconsistent with long-term unemployment
The admirer calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17,000 more in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of an increase in employment rate will run away to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims are known to be attacked in Thailand
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland's time.
The Embassy calls on the Finns in the country to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns' seats in Thailand to cancel their journeys due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale says.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to assess their exact number.
The Finnish Travel Period for Thailand is due to a change in the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish embassy of Finland has received some comments from the Finnish embassy in Thailand via Facebook after bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finnish people in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No data on the author
According to Westphalen, there's still no record of the offender.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the last week's referendum to the constitution drawn up by the military junction.
The law was adopted in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people who declared themselves against the law were arrested in the country.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphale.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local celebration in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the queen's birthday and mother's birthday are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise of safety.
Thai police: No international terrorism is involved in attacks
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Also, Islamic terrorism has been excluded, says Thai Police News Office AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, the popular tourists.
The Finnish tourist destination also, at the holiday island in Phuket, blew four bombs at night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the paper.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, four bombs have been exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than and the city of Trang, at least one bomb was exploded in both South Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is transported to the holiday islands of Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The author of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military train in Thailand, the offender has not yet been known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusing.
We don't have to make people panic more, he told the journalists.
According to Deputy Secretary General for Security, Mr Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that it was the purpose of the authors to destroy the tourism of the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls for the Finnish people to be watchful and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finns who are going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of explosions, but we should follow the guidelines of caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about attacks and victims that have occurred during the night of Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been given some time to get more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians amongst the victims.
At least three people were wounded in the last attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in sight near the known clock tower.
The Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin that he thinks he's found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower cottage, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The CNN interviewed police officer says that the attack on Surat Than was also conducted with two bombs that exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's quadrilateral match
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second to 60.98 and Russian Alija Mustafina with the third 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, after Rio's races, he's still trying to get stack championships on perman, jump and boom.
The party has been in control of women's strength in the last few years.
He's got eight personal world championships from three previous years.
He has won the championships of the four match and permnancy three times in a row and the boom in the last and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has reached two team competition world championships.
More MM medals on the party have jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Father has no influence on tourism"
In Thailand, in Phuket, Esa Huovila, which runs a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that this will result in any more wonderful outcomes, the Huovila worked in Asia as a Finnish entrepreneur for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedys that have been tested near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't expelled tourists, I don't think this is.
The company's office is located a few hundred metres from the explosion site.
The Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine o'clock from the local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the Friday holiday in Thailand.
Patongi was at a calm atmosphere and the main street movements were allowed to open about ten o’clock at local time.
Many had never even heard of the attacks on the beach.
Half a day in Thailand's time in Patong, traffic was normalised and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the scene of the attack, the explosion has been pretty small, says Huovila on the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupuy on Jouxholminti.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for the signs, hiding in a close sixsome.
Another man got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but later he was found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing a motor vehicle, stealing and serious damage.
The police thank the people who gave me the clues.
Research Director for Russian Directorate-General Changes: Clearly removed
On Friday, Russia had a high-ranking managerial change over the years when President Vladimir Putin separated Sergei Ivanov from the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diploma and he's been the second man of Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanovi was fired could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from collecting independent power from the president to themselves.
According to the Cangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught with other leaders or failed.
Ivanoville's deployment
Ivanov, which belongs to Putin's inside, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
By the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that it was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other tasks and suggested that persecution be replaced, said Russia Today.
The Cangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear dismantling.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role at the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
The Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is Putin's switching younger around.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in retreat in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape the city of Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received over 90 percent of the important city of Manbij in Isis last week.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists were left in the city at the time.
Previously on 7:30 p.m., we wrongly said that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Publication of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The Directorate of the Ministry of Interior regarding the publicity of documents is illegal, says professor of public justice, Tomi Voutilainen, University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian tells STT that the public document cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior refused earlier to issue the list of participants of the Minister of Interior's occasions to the Ilta-Sanoms.
The Minister substantiated the decision by a guidance from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministerial Director of Communications tells STT that there is a need to reform practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the tribute races.
From the early age, he insulted his way back and had to skip the Olympics of Jamaica.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-dressed sambatants and fan-formed journalists.
With Porina Bolt, it underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the era when a general sport has struggled with dopingskandaals and skating interest.
Bolt's previous loss in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he fell off at the beginning of 200 metres at 21,05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and relaxed training weapon.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, in which he crushed the final celebration of the world record and competitors, despite the end of the celebration of their competitors, 9.69.
It's harder.
A year later, in Berlin's MM races, Bolt reached his career at the legal point of the watch.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred meters and 19.19 on two hundreds are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200 yards world record and 19 seconds below, but no one else believes in it but Bolt himself.
A hundredth Bolt's very challenge is Ateena's 2004 100 Olympic Winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing MM Final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost the final time in the ranking races during his contemporary reign in Beijing, if only he has made his way.
In the dawn of 2011, the 100-dollar MM finalal was not running from Bolt because of the false departure.
Bolt fills a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
For the last goal line of the career, Bolt has set up next year's MM races in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exhibits from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of doping crime
According to Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample in the Olympics of Rio.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
The Bulgarian drinker, Silvia Daneko, is also suspected of doping crime.
In addition, the Kenya general athletic coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She was in Rio for the fourth place in women's 100 yard butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken its doping cases to address the CAS of the International Court of Petitions of Sport.
Xinhua says that the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday has shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reported that Bulgarian women's drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
On the other hand, Kenia has sent Rio to his home for the doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee of KOK reported that the Kenya coach had acted as a sportsman in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenya's fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps. Historical gold came in the show style.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic History, Michael Phelps, U.S., swims in 200 metres in the mix of 22 Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps arrived as the first swimmer of the same species in the fourth successive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was placed in a mix-up second before China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympics Commissioner Helen Skelton is laughing at the Night Leaf Interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (also on Monday is the most read this week on the Night Magazine website.
Behind commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if some or some British magazines have a small amount of her revealing and special costumes.
Television is a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton's dressed up in high-cost shoes and shortshirts with at least enough revealivity - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and little things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be shaking and perhaps to be shocked, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has passed since Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how much these swimmers work and how great sacrifices they make, is okay for me, Skelton sneezes.
You know what?
It's a clue of empty, if it comes from dressing (runner).
I'm just a little funny if this has hit someone's radar.

7 special things that scientifically prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into the lives of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, however, things that a person cannot influence can bring on him more years.
These include the tendency to average body fatigue or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong the age.
You don't always have to spoil, you know, just picking up a milk bag.
A long-term secret has been sought to solve a number of different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange results.
Science says that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
The study at Harvard University concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the risk of decreasing death, especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, they're talking again about studies that considerably use of one of the three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who were not drinking at all.
Regular use of dental wire can extend the person’s life even for more than six years, a study explains.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents nipple infections.
However, they can contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The study in Norway revealed how laughing had an impact on human life.
More than 54,000 people were monitored by a project lasting seven years.
The people who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the end of the test.
Sex, when sexual protection has been taken into account, many research indicates that health is good.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex like that is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also receive an orgasm.
Of course, sport brings more years, it is not a dispute.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute conspiracy.
A study at the University of Oxford found that the levels of cholesterol were lower for women with a big back.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these facts with lower mortality.
It was then an athlete for the Olympic Meters or an Oscar winner, he is more likely to live longer than the usual one.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings up his life for more years.
However, some researchers suspect that the long age is due to the social status of a person, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on the shopping behaviour of over 65-year-olds found that a person who shops daily, i.e. a parent who is probably less buying.
This is because running in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may premature death.
So, count the credit card from your hand, so the online shop does not have the same effect.
The ugly-humane DUI fell towards the truck.
On Friday night, Koskeke in Varsinais-Suomen, a serious truck and passenger car's belt collar took place.

The roast is on the delivery of the Post until the end of August.
Haltia believed that the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it in social media.

The fairy got his own favorites caught in the pain of the lungs, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for postal transport services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanoms.
The reason is that three of the five stages were diverted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we were no longer going to do subcontract (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stages today, and Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.

Wish of a woman who was murdered in Lovian: Remembering the victim for the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and adresses by donation for the police dog work.
The Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it carries out the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and also performed his nurse’s training there.
The veterinary station remembers the words touching a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and unbearable work.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go to the police dogs as a whole, first and foremost to the purchase of security boats.
Last Friday, a 42 - year - old lovich woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisan Koskenkylä.
The women's neighbors have told the Evening League that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was killed in the arrest situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Circumstantial Court convicted Post of the infringement of the Equality Act.
The post did not have the right to arrest the employee’s salary of the person who refused to study, to assess Kanta-Häme’s court in his judgment.
Post was obliged to pay the employee most of the salary arrested and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the salary of an introductory person who was responsible for the part of the day’s work.
According to the law of the court, the worker had, contrary to the law of equality, been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his professional association activities.
The worker had followed the Union for Postal and Logistics on the prohibition of access to PAU’s organisational decision.
During the last year's postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers would not be familiar with the tenant who broke the strike.
The People News first told me about it.
Returning Turkey to a road respecting human rights

Putin fired the commander of his administration and replaced the Estonian-fashioned persecution.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has separated Sergei Ivanov from the Head of the Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
He's going to be replaced by Karl Vaino's son, Anton Vaino, Communist Director of the Soviet Viro.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired his commander.
According to the Kremlin Communication, Ivanov, which is part of Putin's intimate interior, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other tasks and suggested that persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's spying.
Many considered Ivanov possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
In 2011, Ivanov was appointed president before Putin reeling in 2012.
BBC: ManU's gigantic buy-in to the prohibition of the game will not be seen in the opening of the Valioliiga.
The world recorder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England Valioliiga is kicked on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Because of Paul Pogba's prohibition, Manchester United's giant purchase is on the side of ManU, opening his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, said BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid Pogbasta Italian Society Juventus EUR 105 million.
However, the FA will keep him out of the game, because Pogba left Juvenus to be a ban on the game.
He received two warnings in the Italian cup of last season, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, and the FA told BBC.
The next seam in Pogba to play is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In the Flow, the madness of greatness is the virtue.
The precise criteria for enjoyment and ambitious visions have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally respected event targeted by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festerial drivers have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
One of the headband artists this year is the punk legend of Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stalled, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have just a headship and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind the success: What event would the authors themselves like to go?
It's kind of unusual in the inconvenient to think like this.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official orders, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to finish this year too.
The aim has been to raise the number of visitors in the last year by 5,000 people.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists are seen in the festals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is something to finance.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle flock that is controlled on the huge routes.
That's not what we want.
During 13 years, the successful event has been soaked with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main platform and smaller stages this year, 15 000 tents of people operate.
The collio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of Helsinki in the mid-2000s.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's company amounted to around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "creeches too", like the construction of that 73-foot tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a special fashion.
We want to break up first and foremost with the content.
Yet the fashion phenomena also match the value of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the headband artists is a punk legend, Iggy Pop, 69 years old.
A man has a huge fan crowd in his own genre, but he is not indierock, pop music, rapping and soul-combined festivals.
According to the cliff, Iggy was bucketed because it is probably the last time we see this in Finland.
We're all interested in history and future.
It's not just what the commercial radio calls.
Iggy's last album is a hell of a good one, and he's done a hell of a job in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flowers' bags, and the tourists fled in their horror.
In Hua Hin, two bombs blew up locally on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs must have been hidden in a flower bag and exploded with phones.
The bombs were placed in the street, most of which are foreign.
They were exploded at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returned to their hotels, said the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, the protector of wild animals, who lived in Asia, took a great picture of their attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of the injured persons in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran against him and said that the bomb was exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after this, the Finns also favored two bombs exploded on the Phuket Island.
No one's known to be dead.
At the same time, the Hua Hin had another double bombing attack.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, there was a bomb in Trang's city.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which hadn't been able to explode yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimates that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken seriously into action by criminal organisations dealing with human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new forces will start at war first
In the acute war situation, armed men are only ordered to do battle missions only after several months of swearing a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Head of Education of Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5,5 months of military service, only those who are at the end of their training are able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, firstly, the emergency personnel are assigned to the service.
Sonninen says, no armor or reserve is assigned to a mission that has not been trained as required.
Previously on the summer, the Defence Forces began to train craftsmen to direct capacity units from the next year.
Units may be used for military action, if necessary, in the course of military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a hard fight on the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The commercial price of a two-layer separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious humidity problem in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the matter to trial and demanded a discount from the seller there.
The seller disputed the demand, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court court.
The court delivered a judgment on the matter on Wednesday.
It maintained a judgment in the court of the court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's trial and examining costs of EUR 47 344.
The right to a slightly lower price was reasonable because some of the housing needs had been known to the buyers for the sale of dwellings.
However, according to court law, the manifested construction errors were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
In court court, Tola said that the couple had specifically searched for good homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had the impression that the building has been renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness review report are not harmed.
The rehabilitation inspection report identified ventilation as risk and inconvenience and the lack of adequate management of casting rain and melting waters along clipping.
On the basis of the discussions, however, it did not appear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma found that rain waters coming from the rock should be controlled a little within a few years.
Trading was carried out in October 2009.
In a few years it was evident that the humidity problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed a microbial growth in the building, which, according to the witnesses, resulted from both rock rainwater and capillary ground humidity.
On the western side of the house, air contaminated by microbies could, according to the inspector’s estimate, be accessed through the portal to indoor spaces.
A healthy risk that exceeds the limit values was found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window mixer and the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the dwelling was extended contrary to a building permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo that the dwelling had been subject to unauthorised modifications.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were still no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to court law, buyers could assume that, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to trade, the building was suited for its own residence and that it was not necessary for large-scale repairs in the near future.
According to Tola and Waroma, there was no particular reason to carry out more extensive inspections.
Buyers have not ignored their accountability, the court court states in their judgment.
A scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - in the register also Finnishs
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archive of the United States in Maryland has documents recorded on microfilms with a total of 218 500 women who wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also involve Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish women, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazimorsiam.
Documents and registration cards originate from the Racial Office in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under Heinrich Himmler, head of SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had examined the SS doctor.
The same was true to the greater extent of women who had to be able to give birth to up to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological investigations to investigate the case.
Among other things, the Racial Office examined women’s backgrounds by examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women were also expected to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give a handwritten life stories and good recommendations to the Racial Office.
The racial agency wanted guarantees that women were "bearing children", "saving", and "good national socialists" who knew well in Germany.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's bride.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very active, reports on the websites of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother’s honorary Christian was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were prohibited in law, the museum's pages are stated.
The Sixth of Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing day of Finnjollie’s first departure at the Rio Olympic Games, but the whole crowd remained the top of the day’s second departure.
In the whole situation, the Nirkko rose up to eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in position 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at RS:X day departures in 17 and three.
In general, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In 470 grades, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained at the beginning of the day 23.
In general, the Lindgrens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satlinna was recorded with a couple of hours' nights sleep: "I was so busy."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favourite artifacts for over 20 years.
From the Rising Ship bartender to the Tango King of 1995, the soloartist of Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, the Sillanpää, who is still able to porches, and is currently in a bold lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppis, about the life of the favorite song, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells us about his life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the bridge rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tango King’s crown in the Tango Market of the Wall River in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangs, but he had planned a little different music for himself.
In spring 1995, Jukka Kuopamäki had compiled a tango piece, at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen made in a slightly different form.
The piece of sadtulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of night sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so busy!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You don't know how much you're gonna do about the recording of a huge hit, right now you wouldn't think it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically my best, the trail was good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfect and top all the time.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of a man, reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time, and finally the case ended up with you in the gold piece texts that were published singlely in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäse were not what the Sillanhead would like.
The bridge had imagined being making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the differential song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a complete puppet and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British themselves were surprised by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters had a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the week's opinion measurements anticipated the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the highly respected research institutes or university flagged the difference, although a few individual researchers agreed to disagree with the mainstream of their professions.
The main theme of Western policy, the former President of the US, Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid", flew into the junk in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy seemed not to be the main issue of politics.
Economic harsh language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in his latest monthly survey responds to the Brexit disaster.
The answer of the type is that the economists were not heard because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by the economists on the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workers, which is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the real British.
Many also have the idea that the currency value decrease would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Council, the voters did not believe financial arguments because the unanimity of economists was not sufficiently raised.
In particular, the equilibrium of the BBC, which provided just as much space to economic scientists representing a few percent of the economic diversity of the EU, as well as a vast majority.
The EU-responsive press was not interested to tell us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters are about the consequences of the difference.
These far-reaching combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist messages were both listened and understood, they were not passed on because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think there are common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congest your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre's waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants, too.
How much easier would the children of the real British get to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more room would the originals have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond and, if they succeeded, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have increased jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and particularly immigrants in the EU - are the net payers of the UK public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen's Real Estate Fund was prepared for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the profit of a differentiating camp, started to be more prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left.
It was concerned that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have large liquidity assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the Fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says that Aberdeen's only open daily records of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At that time, the fund was worth 3.5 billion quid.
The total value of the company's funds is about GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10 % or even below it.
Thus, the building funds prepared very different strategies for Brexit.
Funds closed trading
When the differentiating camp won, Europe went confused.
However, the few two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, President of the Central Bank of England, in which he considered that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, freeze his trade.
These together robbed the situation and put it on the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund had to close its doors.
The situation of Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very quiet for a few weeks, Vanhanen tells.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar impact on the Aberdeen Manner European Funds.
However, there was a lot of surveys.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closure of the real estate funds was unreasonable.
Open funds covered by closures are managed by about four per cent of the UK property.
Aberdeen's lock lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 of its property in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that they might hold their funds on the side of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not appear to be "anger" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the UK economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The GBP/dollar course is lowest for 30 years, with 15% discount sales on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar investor can now buy the same property by up to 30 per cent cheaper.
There's a lot of wanting buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look much like it yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, revived to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this goes to plan B, the Oldman says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
Normally, the TV screens in the office were sound-free, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell her that she was divorced this morning.
When the market opened, the ends of the evidence were flashing from the red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd live, the Old man says.
It is not, therefore, that in spite of mystery, Aberdee, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finalised two real estate stores after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leaders switched.
The market started to anticipate severe landings for the real estate markets in Britain and especially London.
Up to 20% of mines were anticipated in London's offices in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the giggle's down, but in the air it's still insecure.
However, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of primary information.
CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to these, the prices of all real estates in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, mine accumulated 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months' changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only in five months there have been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All similar falls occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and to the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate markets.
According to the old man, the parable is not entirely appropriate, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another tunnel.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that, but willingness to sell liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's a financial jacket, too.
The repair movement could have been in front of it anyway.
As a matter of fact, the price repair business is not a miracle for him, that could have been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world’s first cities have been too high for years.
For two years, we have said that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, Oldman says.
So the drop started very high.
London's prices are rising up for four reasons, the old list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London, as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that becomes globalised, Oldman says.
New players have become marketed in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city, an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, for example, pension companies have been forced to seek income from new items.
On this issue, the loan has been easily available - although the debt line has been used by the Old Man now clearly less than the buum before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse.
In London, the price rise was set last summer, Vanhanen tells us.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce his ownership in London, and he was a net salesman last year.
There was some kind of turning to be expected, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Oldman.
A lot he dares to assess the future, but he says there's hardly any swing on the rise.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a decreasing or even course ahead.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes to dismantle the world.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much victims.
If you've dispersed, the risks are also decentralised, Vanhanen says.
The S group begins to register purchase information more closely than before
Point S knows what you eat, because the trade group said that today it was beginning to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its stock customers.
Once data have so far been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will also begin to hug it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S group is coming here after Kesko, as the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to the Executive Director of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitalan's return from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific information shall be collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing authorisations.
The most efficient channel is an e-mail.
There are quite few customers who have denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
In his opinion, Kesko is not going to react to a change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko is already classifying its stock customers according to only food purchases into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Information is used for targeted marketing.
Purchase information per product is collected only from the K group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, will not be given their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a stock client program or such a program.
The Middle Shop in Finland has its own one-Bosbonus stock client program, which can be included in the Choice Houses, Siwas and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group data, we remain at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the shops were purchased, and on the day and the client's final receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like a K group or a S group, says a commercial leader, Anu Ora.
He believes that the stock client programme will continue to be reformed, but the Neighbourhood Commerce will report on it later.
However, the Ora does not authorise that product information would be subject to registration.
Trying at the beginning
The SOK customer and customer register has still been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included professions, training, housing, children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Etucards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, the final amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, information from the S bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data of the product level are started to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terrors and ABC chains, the data are recorded at the product group level.
For a longer time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be more specific, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK's customer owner and partner business.
The S group says that he should inform his customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored in bags anyway, wanted it or not.
The desired person can check his stored information on the S group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to the information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila-Boy is the latest confirmation of the Customs - the kid becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador-outer's kid is heavily squeezed by five similar kinds of box in line at Helsinki-Vanta Airport.
It won't take long to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat reveals a bottle of seals that exploded to the grid gas.
Steam gas is the first scent that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for firearms and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Jobs may also take Heila and Suntio to other crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
In Tull, the attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures and after the attacks, surveillance has been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another way to train a gun and explosive corridor is postal broadcasts via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of growing internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments are carried through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the Customs has made about 300 of the purchases of online shops, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport with regard to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their sources.
Heila will work across Helsinki.
It's going to investigate the recorded baggage and mailings.
In the ports, it will be a major benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Greenberg.
Based on the performance of the sound, Customs will assess whether further training of weapons and explosives will be made in the future.
Grönberg hopefully sees the idea.
School at the Church Nurse
The training of the Heila-Peneum is coordinated by the School of Dogs of Customs, located on the Church Numme.
Suntio also trains with Heila at police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defense Forces with expertise in explosives.
The customs office together with the other authorities will decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
The beech is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
The Heila colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador's caterer Heila has been selected from 10 puppies' puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog to be chosen at the airport include a leap and a hunting voyage, as well as peace as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to get home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
The delicate orders are going to Heila's place from the one-pack.
Tonight's cameraman loses the camera cap on the fast dog, but Heila restores the soft toy cap right away from the "open" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
The initial training of the helicopter will be completed next year.
There are still level tests to be carried out next in October, assessing whether training is sufficient for the required work.
The Heilan can be seen in work on Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to the plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to silk the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
One working dog costs approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they are retired for the care of their owner.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active working hours will last from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the workers' dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
He picked up some 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministries got their first Olympic Medal... the people get a day off.
In Rugby the Olympic Gold of Fidži, less than a million inhabitants, the government has appointed the national day of August 22.
According to the public broadcasting company, the Fidži Government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off will be held for the team to return home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their own country.
Fiji's rugby team party championship.
The Guardian tells us that the country was followed by a final in the capital of Suva, where the stadium had a set screen.
Normally, only the naive Fijis are interested in Rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, heard them encouraging, said the editor of Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish writer fainted after a wild performance
The weight provider Milko Tokola succeeded in his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the penalty lifts, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
Tokola got 175 pounds and 145 pounds in Rio.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last 175 pounds, as well as one another.
In the third attempt, the weights were rising with the hurricane screaming.
The body was shaking under weight until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish minister was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virola wanderer in Prosan - A betting leaga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, who plays a football league, has concluded a long-term agreement with the official cheerleader Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for the top player of our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovanieme is small.
With more than ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players all over the world.
Prosa, the coach of RoPS Juha Malinen, became a good option to separate from the group.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from a stable Flora, where he made 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played in Estonia's country team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemeans meet the Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal queen Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The threat to the Modern Family Star again: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern family comedy series, nice Alex Dunphyna, has become familiar with Ariel Winter, again by showing his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week at the minihorts that don't leave much for imagination.
Shorts uncovered not only the actress' legs but also this ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior much more bold.
The star has posed in the pictures published in social media in very few clothing and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing very short clothes.
Winter on the nail of adulthood has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it from here.
Previously on this summer, Fox News asked the experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In that case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected Winter had a "typical Hollywood change" from the star of childhood to adulthood.
He's been on television almost all his life and grew up during the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has disgusted some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to know where he is in ten years, when the fall is so hard now, a woman in Winter's Instagram says.
However, some of the women's fans are defending an actor and urged not to listen to criticisms.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're an inspiration for many women. You're a young woman.
The Japanese preferably want to go from the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the recession: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy mirror in Aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their retreats from the beginning, Visit Finland will report in the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese camping.
Recess fires are artificial cards in our winter trip and are strongly combined with heart winter and snow landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, there is a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of the autumn trips.
Few people know that the recession season begins from early autumn and continues far to spring.
At the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror Aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the rear flames by making two multitudes of a saturated vision, says Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who are dreaming about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey carried out by the Aalto University and by the researchers at the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the Japanese as compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more explicit sights of Finland, and Lindi said that the revontulus has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed over double in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland's tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to be happy with the silver in the rugby-7 race when Fidz's master team won gold.
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the seven players' rugby race was broken with Fidzi winning it on Thursday in the final of the Rion Deodoro Stadium, at the 43-7th grade.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, transfers, lateral practice, support games, runlines, and razor, and thus won gold — if there was the first Olympic medal of all history to the country.
The loss meant silver, which was a little more thin comfort for Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success as the first type of Olympics in the rugby-7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the 7 to 5 semi-finals earlier on the same day, the strong profit from the Boxes in South Africa could have negatively influenced the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British even if the 15-life team had been in full power.
The United Kingdom may be comforted by the fact that tomorrow at least one British will receive a gold medal: the former Rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon, Mr Ben Ryan, Fidz's chief coach.
Experience has been quite awkward for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The loss hurts, but progress is astonishing.
Fidzi started excellently and presented his tactical skills to the United Kingdom as a reason for fun.
It seemed like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a bunch of mobile buses, and the world champions rose from 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau crashed down the corner.
And when it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made another goal on the right of the shot.
Situation between 12 and 0, and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's fantastic tactic prevented Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it didn't slow down Fidz.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right corner, followed by the United Kingdom’s 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made a second goal of the follow-up initiative, when the first half-time game time was more than a minute left.
After this Vatemo Ravouvou smashed through the British team's even more powerless tacks and struck across the goal line.
The opening period ended from 29 to 0 after the slot.
It seemed like the Fidzians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the role of the student.
Whatever's so much true.
The United Kingdom made extensive changes in half-time and managed to hold up the physics for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half-time until Josua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team of physics.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36-7 by making the UK the goal at the left corner, but the game had long ago been lost to the architects of the South Sea, whose fans were singing, swinging tickets and dancing.
It was difficult not to admire Fidz’s purely cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final squeeze into the cake of the Fidzians by making the paint in the final moments.
The Pill rings, the Fidzians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won in the Japanese semifinal at 20-5 and the United Kingdom had been over South Africa in a tight semifinal, where the balance solved the UK goal break.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his devastating footwork and smashed under the goal toilets in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is Anthony Watson's brother of the Rugby team of 15 players in England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to play gold.
This is more emotional than gold in these races.
From the first draw, the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning played a 220 winning bet in history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the airways, the third sound of coach Robin Williams in the boat, which encouraged them to take another successive Olympic gold in the double of women, making them the first women in the history of British sports, which promote the corresponding achievement.
Their overpower was unquestionable, their victory was already 39th successive and once again recordable.
What we see is two brilliant athletes connecting on the surface of water like swans of age, not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There is a large number of helpable hands behind each war gold, each of which has contributed to the achievements of the twin, but the most important of the assistants is the coach with 30 months ago diagnosed cancer and who did not then know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at that time.
"I had a bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's a little change in the way of thinking."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trinity was lucky that Williams was able to start treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, where the interruption caused as little harm as possible if it was even possible to say in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department at 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The row itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning, the British Royal Army Group, who was behind the Afghanistan, says, "I've been in the class level this week in ruins, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so incredibly much thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to compare.
Even at the last 500 meters when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very busy in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It's very important not to get out of the way."
"We managed to go well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't seek the sky today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The twin will think about a year before he decides about his future.
Glover will celebrate next month with Steve Backshall from TV nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took me about six months before I realized I was a Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to understand.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland switches to the Government of Panama, which has been confined to Panama
Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections in October, which are demanded by demonstrators aroused by Panama's data leaks in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed the circumvention of taxes by a number of Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Mr Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson broke up because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s recent spring rage affects the success of the autumn election.
During the June presidential elections, the criticality of the authorities was clearly evident and the President was elected Gudni Johannesson, who was not in the political position.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The President of the Republicans of the United States Donald Trump canceled his latest atrocities.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clintonk.
The Democrat Party was upset by speeches and demanded apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone down like that, Clinton, be the chief of the army.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has denied the most popular use of the Muslims' cover-up burkine swimsuit in bathing areas, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming is prohibited by anyone who does not have a good way and a bathing suit that respects culturalism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious links, can increase the risk of irregularities in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In the mid-July 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31 - year - old man drove into the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations joined Daddy attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu area crossed the sieve - Blue samentum in the toilet lake
The water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Bluefin dust has only been observed on the bathing shore of the Towel Lake.
During the Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action of the Oulu region took water samples from nine coasts of the Oulu region and 30 other general beaches.
Excluding the sea coast, the concentrations of all bathing areas of E.coli and intestine gastrointestinal gastrointestinal bacteria were below the operational limits laid down by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus in the sea bathing ranch were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue sand found on the beach of the toilet lake does not yet make the water unsuitable, but in favour of favourable conditions, the situation can quickly change as a blue flower, thus forming on the surface as blue-green floats.
The environmental action will monitor the situation by enlarged inspections.
If the blue sanctuary becomes a blue flower, it shall also be reported separately on a bathing beach notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen’s forest gift reduction: over 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Act of Income Tax proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a generation of the forestry exchange tax.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forestry exchanges, to youngen the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forestry and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would reduce the clean income of forestry capital.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry farms is good, commenting on Juha Hakkarainen, Head of Forestry Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers.
However, the perpetrator finds a critical tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is presented as a function of the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could directly result from the sales of wood.
The proposal for a VM provides that by decreasing the clean income of the forestry will prevent the loss of forestry capital income, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if he didn't sell a tree.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the value of the forest’s income is EUR 40 000.
He thinks it's too high.
In such a way, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners would be cut off from the land.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In the forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been withdrawn for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.

Two persons were transported to the hospital in the back of the car.
There's no more specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove above was not injured.
An accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga to a few miles from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer cancer increases the malignancies of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to respond to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the studies were published on 4 August in the valued Natural Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The murder of Muho will continue in the court, the prosecutor will also require a murder warrant for another author.
The death of Muhos' family home continues in the court of both convicteds.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of family in Muhos.
The second received eight years for four months, inter alia, the murder and the robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years imprisonment for the murder and the robbery of a young person.
The person who was convicted of killing was also convicted of a serious threat to traffic safety as a young person and of the transportation of the vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who had been sentenced more severely were complaining of the judgment of the court.
The prosecutor demands a less punished man to be condemned for the murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked in July last year as a child protection unit instructor of the school home.
The 17-year-old who received the murder warrant attacked the judge, according to the reasons behind the director sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had got rid of the door and had tolerate his young room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The driver was also strangled, beaten and kicked.
According to the mental study, both judges were fully understood at the time of the work.
According to the court, young people had been planning to escape a family home from at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The world's longest live spine has been secured by ice shark, reports a research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, as in Greenland, a floating ice shark, or a holker, can live for up to 400 years.
She's only growing when she's 156 years old.
The life expectancy of the ice shark is that it grows only in a centimetre a year.
Only one species of hemp is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered the age with a radio steam drive.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
According to these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years of age, although a twist in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Visa - People News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the State would be disregarded if the change in the corporate tax led by Donald Trump would be carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by means of the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolutionary presentation on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
I'd never collect a huge amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the reduction put forward by Trump, 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of overregulating business and bankruptting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided by the Häts must be re-entered and the energy regulation must be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be taken into account.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destructive" trade policy is the main causes of the US's problems.
They'd be renounced of free trade agreements.
The Chinese imports would be charged at 45% and 35% in Mexico.
We offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our confession of faith, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American planes to combine cities, American ships to oversee the sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump read faithfully through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists, even those close to the Republicans, see Trump's programme taking the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday, Finland's time.
Attack wave of the past - People News
The sea is fateful, but the actual wave of assault strikes in the middle of the street of Madrid, the accounting with the past can begin.
It summarised the core of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's news.
The previous steering work of Almodovar Travel lovers (2013) was a small fun and satiric comedy, the predecessor skin where I live the tops of the Spanish strife's career.
Julieta (2016) is equally located somewhere between those two works.
It's an intimate, intimate, human and family drama that is at the heart of the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot as a long backup.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged denominator (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of random encounter, the new man friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be admired until the end of the film.
In the form of a back and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of his life to his adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from a TV-treatment series between Ommelten (2013-2014), will rise.
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a cunt, but I would say that it is a bit of a staggering and verbally repeated sweep.
Often the Almodóvar films have a fair distance to such a sense of explosion in Julieta.
It is evenly played, controlled, a place of good music and a rather sad-minded film with its ingredients in the elite.
Instead, the visual saturation of colours typically characterized by the Spanish instructor is retained in such a way that it begins to squeeze a little quietly into the eye more as a clean form than as an effective dramatic means of action.
Diseases, deaths, or incidental loss in the film, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a denominated person, the costumes vary from the scene to the point, and the same applies to apparent ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, the vice-definitions of this scene, too, is not better.
When mechanically recurs, the impression is external and little spiritless.
Almodóvar has made a manuscript based on three novels of Canadian Alice Munro, awarded by Nobel 2013.
The novelles have been published in The Runner: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a bit of written literature accreditation.
It would have been an emotionally unprecedented drama, that much of the big things - especially the thematics of the sneaky guilt movie.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the movies is 12.8 p.m.
The government is trying to pick up the people's news.
There are no new cuts to be done, the hoisting ministers so that the Finns do not crash completely.
However, the cuts that have been completed in the spring will be carried out in a trash shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Kok.) are convinced under the budget gap.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the VM, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of an ansionary unemployment insurance is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
Municipalities Haunting
Why do ministers so hardly emphasise the fact that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities are held in April and are the most important heat meter of the election period, not the gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the local result of the different directions of the government parties will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallutes tell us that the Government Party expects a slight loss of Finns, even though its previous elections resulted in a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the right government next spring.
The line of life of the government of the three, approximately equally large parties, is in line with the survival of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough government policy over the first year.
The first signs of the group of parliaments of the party have also come to the surface.
Firstly, the fact that new cuts will not come from the rhetoric is the fact that they will be carried out sharply next year, and secondly, they will try to soften the attack awaiting the Finns.
Great surgery in 2018?
In a year, everything is likely to be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of inflating debts in this election period, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take up EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the midst of the parliamentary period and to admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt will not be cut and even slow.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This will mean even harder cuts on the former in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would at least reach a close balance in 2018, and then in the spring Parliamentary elections will take up what will come.
Debts do not fall under these measures
It is absolutely clear that debts in current activities do not fall, even though Juha Sipila is trying to squeeze a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State to Hetemäen's budget in the outsourcing report show it unanimously:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has been prolonged on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the rounds presented in the week, government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-in the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by the new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the meeting and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: Municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four consider that organising day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it is reflected in the research of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also take responsibility for a single municipality from libraries, culture, citizens' schools, building supervision, high school training and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is more clearly desired by the local cavity, special care, vocational education, vocational higher education and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are required to be transferred to the State.
A juicy underage runs after the chase, running away from the police.
Joensuu 16 - year - old motorcycle driver ran the police patrol out in Joensuu at Ilomantinti on Friday night at 7:30 p.m.
The police force tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man left to run the police off at fair speed.
The rear driving continued to the Sonkajarand Road, which continues to take the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After this, a young man ran away, but a quicker-footed cop ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed 0.75 prom.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell down the street.
The truck in the rock cargo crashed on the Knee Lake Kaavinti on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drove to the left in a curved drive out of the road and fell on its side of the yard.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue shelicopter staff and the first nurses.
The driver's job was to pick up the vehicle.
From the fallen truck, a hydraulic oil was spilled on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.

Observations and clues of missing movements are requested to call the North-West State Station Clue number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air... look at the gallery of the destruction of Parafest.
The flooding of the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
The President of the Joensuu Parafestity Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will be economically up and that the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the parafest was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the tower laval.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations to be held at the theatre's premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised in a planned manner.
A flood flow occurs in the cloud when the rainwater and its weight start the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the form of cloud water bind the heat, so the decreasing air mass cools and speeds towards the earth.
It is reported from the Air Science Institute that several flows occur during the summer in Finland.
It's hard to predict the routes of flows.
The flood hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents crashed, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly offended.
One child was transported mildly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution depletes the Londons
According to the study, the skin of the lontooians is getting old faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
Evening Standard's on the British investigation.
The British Skin Treatment Company Caci analyses London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired lontooians is two and a half years older than, for example, an age-friend living in the countryside.
Skin aging small particles are a very fine dust pollutant from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases to which Evening Standard says nearly 9 500 lonsters die every year.
The studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those lonsters who walk their work in the vicinity of congestive streets.
London people can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but it is recommended that the skin be cleaned regularly as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes betrayed the man standing before you.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes cheated, and the tractor rolled on a man.
However, the man did not miss it, but the tractor had enough time for a pushed man to carry him to the central hospital with serious injury to further investigations.
The tractor didn't have time to flow any further, because it ran into the stones that were in front of him.
The Rise of the New Power to the Future Period

Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the MM races of the salibandy since 2003.
Now, the sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 were missed after Canada was better in the North American quarrys.
I was working in Turku and playing with a woman in that area when I noticed the announcement.

I was interested, and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near the city of Elizabeth in New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when a girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that was not yet played at SM level like a salibandy.
They played the blunt at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in the River Boys in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing in a prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to stop as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary season.
Beach Volley's Finnish championships will be settled in Kouvolan Sports Park on weekends.
During three days, medals are played in the series of adults and young people.
The six best pairs of the ranking of each series will be eligible for the SM final tournament organised by Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Air Ballball Union.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of the Finnish beach volley peak for many years.
Today, Hasu, a resident in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people can get to the view this weekend.
I'm sure the wash stadium is coming in a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu sensation.
The Kouvolan region set Hasu on a rock and gave a good meal to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood in mind.
When I was 9 years old, I started the balloon with Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big toy shirt, knee shields in the ankles, and great ace lips and choreographics after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the Sports Society was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The joint spirit of the group created an environment that was nice to play.
All the families were very involved, and the teammate's father trained us, and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural species selection to counterweight the inner balloon.
There's been a play on the curved beach since the 1990s.
The activities have always been active in the visits.
I also went to the junior SM tournament myself, thinking that one day I'd be there myself.
Now this dream is real when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkise in SM-finals this weekend.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament of the second-tipped twin is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
Our SM gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mystery.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are awaited.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, the toe parts are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Salomon Koli went bravely as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk gains, sweats and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started working with her little brother Valtteri Koli shortly two years ago as a contributor to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Initiation as a rural enterprise meant debt and increases in order to allow the bread to come to the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been on a farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we were going to build a steep shaft, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic.
I did, however, really bravely join the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger navels.
The work has resulted, for Solomon Koli has been selected to the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Earth’s Future magazine.
At the best time, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria will first report inflation to eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.

The annual average inflation rate measured by CPI over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from July 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation percentage from the beginning of the year (July 2016 % compared to December 2015) has been –0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, increased prices of the following categories of consumer products were observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport modes (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household machinery and fixed-term care equipment (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticised as an Asian caricatry
Snapchat says that this filter was an anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change the reality and play with identities that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The birds are unbearable, deforming tools to create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All misleadings quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses are part of the criticism where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or white skin tones as a beauty seed.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into wrinkles, it distorted teeth and made cheeks bulls, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered if these repeated contradictions were referring to a major problem that the company had with differentiality.
News and rage spread widespread on Wednesday and wrote online publications of The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to be an honorary demonstration for the anime characters, not for the chariot of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of the anime-comparations were rigid.
The Korean-American art student, Grace Sparapani, whose twits were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least insulting and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny a very flavorless Asian circumference to the filter efficiency.
It shows that the filter is not just "yellowface," but it's taken to a despising extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it seems that there is an endless struggle of divergent and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment we are transporting with us.
The large audience of Snapchat consists of young people who are more varied from ethnic backgrounds than their parents’ answers. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more excellence.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, this type of things will no longer be noticed very easily, as previously," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu at the interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, as the product manager and designer, decided to remove Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In the article published in the medium and in the phone interview he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of respect for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticizes most of the company's White and solely Men's Board of Directors and decided its writing with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that in their unilateral staff there are no coloured people in which they can make such decisions, or then they also have colored workers, but their position is not that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily" says Zhu, Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely ignored the argument.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, insisting on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to his reporter, the company has recently hired a recruiter to concentrate on reduced human groups and to promote participation within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congress expert group, military officials distorted information on Isis
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group announced a report that officials of the US Armed Forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Daddys in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the field gave cause to understand.
According to the analysts, the leaders of the Subcommittee for Inquiry and Defence Assistance Committee of the United States Representatives' Board (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group, which is reported in the mid-term report on the 'general content of intelligence analysts'.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results accepted by Centcom's senior leaders gave a positive picture of US counter-terrorism activities, which were generally more positive than the facts on the field, and were unavoidably more positive than the analysis of the other units of the intelligence community," reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events cannot be accepted – our soldiers are suffering when they present false analyses to high-level political decision-makers," says Ken Calvert, the Republican representative of California.
"Centcom's lead errors reach the organisation's highest level."
The 10-page report describes the problems that persist in 2014 and 2015, which the Central Command's descriptions and analysis of the American activities to train Iraqi forces.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the administrative authorities of Obama have been falsified, it gives an image of the analysts, which suggests that the Centcom leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of the year 2015, many of the witness statements from Central Command's press releases, opinions and Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually existed," says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official made a public statement that a large military assault could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in control of Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"from mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-level intelligence leaders of US armed forces manipulated the results of the intelligence received to minimise Isisi's threat in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after finding out the suspicions expressed by analysts that information on Isis would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more detailed results as the studies continue.
In addition, the superinspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an investigation of Centcom's intelligence data.
On Thursday, the Democrats of the Committee on Inquiry of the House published their own results, which were partially consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the period 2014-2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for assessing information on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's High Representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "fracted the morality of analysts" and "inadequately remarks of discrepancies".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the analysts of Centcom to adapt its conclusions to the "formal or political line".
The news site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the study carried out by the Congress.
In August last, New York Times reported the investigation by the Pentagon Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon reporter, Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, says when he announces that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspector's investigation is under way.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation also has other consequences, in addition to trying to determine whether the bombings led by the United States have been successful in Iraq and Syria (arguments made by a number of defence authorities).
However, the arguments made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and give honest estimates of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of personal intelligence corresponds to the disagreements that occurred over a decade ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that President George W. Bush's government, despite the opposition of many analysts, only supported small forces in Iraq and spent only a little time on the question of what would be followed by the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isise intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that despite the contradictory public opinions, the air strikes in Isis' controlled processing plants had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and thus managed to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the findings of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The Centcom Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after a number of legislators assessed the statements of witnesses to the Senate were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win a fourth double fight in women's country-hockey and will establish its position for interim clarification with Britain
After making three goals in the winner, painting 6-1 in the solved game against Japan Katie Bam made the US Women's Land Hockey Country team two first goals on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a major achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep a number of paintings they make."
However, he knows that the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost zero games and share their group first with Britain, who continued to win their winning pipes on Thursday, in the Japanese chapters 2 to 0.
The UK and the United States are playing the opposite on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which determines which one of them is the first and second of the six teams.
The first person who is to avoid meeting longer with a firm Dutch team, who won the second block.
Despite what happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised their surprising success in these races, four years after the last 12 teams in London's Olympics.
Bam was in the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and was first caught in the country hockey field when he was only three years old (the parents of his twin sisters played a species in Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final playlist.
After that, the 2012 races came, where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"We worked in London, there was no such thing as it is now.
We've made a complete translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account at the first half of time by hitting the ball near a rush in.
India had come to the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be a surprisingly hard opponent and maintained the situation from 1 to 0 until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, twisted to the middle, hit the ball in the paint, and thus led the Americans to 2 to 0.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament where the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the Americans had hit each one.
Briggs is now living for his success.
Like Bam.
"We are now good", says Parnham, but how good it is, depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the Olympic Hulina, trampolin brings zeni
Despite the place and time, the Olympics will inevitably run into the Olympics.
Events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intensive message constantly and everywhere.
It's like the Olympic Fire itself is a flammable message cap that moves from a bowl sniper to a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the coffee shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time in the Olympics, Dooley's charm smiles and might well be the name on all the lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular by the sponsors and would appear in the TV ads of good mind if he was just a swimmer, a winner, or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28, from California Lake Forest, competes at the Olympic Gold with trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not ease all competitions.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, spring fire, feathering ball and taekwondo.
We'll always have breast swimming, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a humble story about my own special favor, I would like to draw attention to the restrained attraction of tramplin.
Although trampolin has been an Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic type.
Unawareness can be region-specific.
Athletes from the United States have been involved in the Olympic Trampolin, but the country has never reached the medals and has not progressed in the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side the medals are shaving Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan are defending gold medals this year, which they won in London.
However, trampoline has the charming power of the survivor, partly because in an uncultivated ear it sounds more appropriate to circus school than the Olympics.
(I recognise in this context that I am not an expert, only a regular fan.)
The species have a concentration of potential used in the drawings in the endless stunning scenes of the figures, but it also has the same dignity as in the gym and the swim jump, the species that are essentially connected to the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a "trampboard".
Prior to landing, a series of acrobatic movements, such as circumferences, skills and voltages, have to be carried out by honorable masters.
According to the official Olympics program, hypnotisation is based on performance, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes who come from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline power, 16 and 16 women.
The most common Olympic species are headed straight forward.
Meditation brains need to reach more, faster, up and over, sometimes over the goal line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the painting line or the starting wall, they also have another objective for which they are seeking a television reporter, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is superior, admirable, even fanatic — and even enough to get a viewer to tears.
But I also think this is a little exhaustive just in the sight of the races.
This trampolin offers a breathing break.
Trampolin is heading upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast will rise in weightlessness as an astronaut, fall down and sneak back up the trouble.
Of course, the species also include a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not involve intense ambush to the goal or jump far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympics contest can get.
Women’s fights and finals will take place Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 a.m. local time and men’s similar races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will start at the Kumppan on the day of 14 a.m. local time.
In the midst of the Olympic Games, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might not be noticed in the midst of the general nuts.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and performing them – as the U.S. manpowerers, according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested – then Logan Dooley only expects his new fan gang.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term American ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
The government's troops have dismantled demonstrations that require political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several demonstrators have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, and it has been a reliable alliance in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over recent months, the country has been shaken by anti-governmental demonstrations that are spreading to wider regions.
Only last week, thousands of people roamed on the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
According to eyewitnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
From the demonstrations, it is expected that the videos described at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security forces hit young people who are forced to stand by their hands against the wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Officer now calls for in-depth research.
"Staining the country together has always been difficult and moving forward is even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarv.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. army and intelligence support closely the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, receive so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, and the capital in Addis Abeba is even a new landscape.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy; human rights organisations have continuously reported the repression policy of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited and the dissidents are rapidly depressed.
Many people have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and there is no other way than to show their minds, it will go out," says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a university journal in Central Ethiopia.
"The whole young man shows his mind.
"The whole generation protests."
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, always of the use of the coalition of the government to strangle.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the party and its allies received the last place before the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions increase at Eritrea’s border, where the rising situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Freedom Front, may try to take advantage of confusion and rearrange themselves in recent years.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has become underneath the surface now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only for the last few years, the Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when the cheaper smartphones became common and access to the Internet improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access to the Internet through mediation servers that hide their location.
Many young people in Ethiopia told us that this is how they called people for demonstrations.
Another reason is to increase solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, oroms and ambhares.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
The ambhares from above Christendom, mostly from Ethiopia, have long been governing the country’s policy and business and have dismantled the oroms, most of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
But this is also changing.
"The joint work is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, the Oromo Director.
The main demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many ambhares and oroms experience that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the tribe of Tigre, representing only about six percent of the population and, however, governing the army, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind trouble is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of displeasure and to use ambassadors who agreed on the counterparties.
"This essential instinct is missing by the current government," says Consultant Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, entered the Meles boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were encountered in 2005, when thousands of people showed their opinion against the elections that the government first stumbled and then stole, according to analysts.
In post-elections, many protestors were killed, although the dead were less than in the previous months, and the restlessness ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for long-distance infrastructure planning, such as the new landscape train, and the major steps forward in combating poverty.
But the internal anger against the government of Ethiopia has clearly not prevented the intensification.
And the anger is taking dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked the companies owned by Tigres, and the anger speech against Tigres is becoming widespread in social media.
According to the analysts, protests put the United States and other western allies in the situation.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft, the neighbouring country of Somalia, but, according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies in an unstable area to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to draw his words back in the last campaign, claiming that he was not serious in saying several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the base of the Isis terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side of the ability of the candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of their countries.
His supporters also face an awkward situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump submitted a statement at the election meeting on Wednesday night and repeated the interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton had created Daddy.
However, early Friday morning Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarkasm.
Trump tweeted completely on his speech from the previous day, when I told him he was serious about his accusations at several interviews.
When the radio drinker and the Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trum soften their claim by saying that Obamaha was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to retreat his argument.
The latest storm of criticism rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back to the economy when the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton had their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and considered Clinton's speech to be boring.
Trump has been defended before in the sarkasm.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump draws the limits of the political speech and withdraws its words, if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how supporters react to messages, and "specify" by way or by other reaction," says the communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are enough rounds to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the general elections, Trump has changed his style in the last few days even more intensive when his support numbers have continued to decline.
On Friday, the new NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristi's opinion study reported that Trump's support is considerably lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provoking speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misinterpret his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more intensive, the jokes of his presidential campaign in the last few months have put Trump in his loyal supporter's awkward position, where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, the former mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the candidate for President in the interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think his words are justified, as a political speech," Giuliani replied when asked him if Trump was true in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Daddy.
"That's true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization, which Obama called completely incorrectly "the team of the lower series", and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most of the Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isis to continue to act when it did not resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on media on Twitter, where he accused them of struggling his speeches and discriminatory attitude toward him.
He ridiculed the "unworthy and pathetic" television commuters who were trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn't succeed.
Some of the democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and they just said it would show more clearly that he was not suitable for the president.
Because of an increase in excessive rent, the stop coffee shop opens in Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a little brilliant café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used to make a payment, and there was no Wi-Fi, but he offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of his street spot on Bedford Avenue, when the rent went undue.
Verb Cafe in place in the summer of 2014 Soap Cherie sells cupcakes soaps.
Locals consider this under mid-classification to avoid the loss of a café.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is no longer the former, it's also being created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe at Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has a Wi-Fi and can pay on a credit card, but some of the workers are the same and the atmosphere is still unsweety.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee in the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb order bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressochone model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new, and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon chicken egg cheese sandwichees available and can be filled with cupcakes and brown onion rings.
There are also dark skins on the list.
No more beer, but fresh fruit juices.
After nine months in the cafe, Rodriguez says that old standard customers began to go to Verb as a smooth flow.
"So many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg," she says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visit Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk to the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he's finished the coffee schedule for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," she says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai-tea show instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also listed.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, went to Verb faithfully since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before he worked and ordered the same thing without exception.
"I stepped into the cafe every day for more than 15 minutes, like a machine, and there they already made my butterbagelian with all the fillings," she says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal continues to order its standard product, but occasionally he varies the bacon, egg and cheese fillings of his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hate the fact that the soap store took away the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is used for the manufacture of Verb’s own cold-cleaned coffee.
"We can still take the offer," says Rodriguez.
The Polish traditionally living in Greenpoint have also accepted the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu to the side, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors welcome.
The new place has brought other advantages.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-creamed coffee in the cafe.
The café may also expand into a building next door.
However, for many customers, it is sufficient that they receive their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client in Williamsburg, and he says he broke his heart when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like it came home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the cafe."
A Great Recession Dirt Food in New Paper: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at lunch in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as a culinary, was pleased with the luxurious foods of the restaurants in Fifth Avenue, such as gloves and Maryland's turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: the deviled eggs of the deviled eggs in the tomato sauce, potato mush and dessert from the mushroom.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights works as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, reports about the Chinese kitchen in America, while the latest book of Ziegelman, called 97 Orchard, reports the story of a floor in the city of Lower East Siden.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food in the 1930s in the great recession period.
The parish showed its own culinary solidarity in reconciling with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloud and opened in the same year as the big stock exchange crash took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive oil sandwich and Coe 57-year-old turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered a meatcake, the couple said it was appropriate for a very large debate on the eating of the recession.
"The murmurs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut peanuts, liver cream, and papagore.
They were made of substances that were cheap and controversial.
Imagine eating so much peanuts, they'll be enough for a meal."
Andrew Coe's making fun of you.
"It must have pressed in the stomach like a lead," he says.
Before the great recession years, the American table, especially in the countryside, worked with the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for farmers, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner was served with retrained pies.
The Americans had just sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. The Square Meal is a crown of ways in which the people survived when suddenly the abundance had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when the food became an American central and distressing subject", says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the worrying was a new affordable diet: Ziegelman said that the mysterious foods such as crackers and pot food became the main food, and the battalion was called a "powerful way to use the food stars" because the cocktails could not cover so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Muscle, which had been the most important part of the American meal for years, became the luxurious use.
We experimented with strange mixtures, most importantly the completion of calorie and diet values, not even taste or even a healthy kitchen system.
When doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelma prepared oven flakes filled with peanut butters used as a pula-time meal.
"It was not popular at the dinner table," says Coe,
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion aren't fit at all.
This was characterised by a number of household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was headed by the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, led people’s eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be precisely budgetmakers and to meet the challenge of making carrot-kermaspaget-like flavored foods.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historic tastes.
Particularly delicious are reports of the government's responses to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let me eat cake" weapon.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his child in an iow farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a finest gentleman who had become.
"He liked the Continental European kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a golden-coated dining room, wearing a tux.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had encouraged him to show an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper, who had no interest in the taste, the foods offered in the White House were not only the boringest in Washington, but also the worst."
Many of the discomfort foods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the tradition continues to show how we pay attention to calories and food and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple tells us that they began to understand better about the food habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why he couldn’t throw away food.
"He really feared that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even started getting sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For the first time, I've had the bullies."
After the main food plates were empty at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plumprint food they had at home, the same thing that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called Plumbing Wax", says Ziegelma and adds that giving an apparent name to modest receptors was a general trick.
There was no cream wax, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cannabis.
We drowned our spoons against the thick brown dick.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe danced the second time and the third time.
"German nuts would do better than this," says Coe to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
For Gilead, full compensation for legal fees from the patent tribe of the hepatitis C medicine with Merck
The Court of Justice of the United States decided that the Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal fees incurred by it in dispute with Merck & Co Inc on the patent of the hepatitis C medicinal product.
In June, Gilead was exempted from the $200 million compensation for the violation of two Merck patents in connection with the prosperity medicines named Gilead Sovaldi and Harvon. The United States judge found that Merck had committed offences involving the wrong whale and other unethical practices.
Beth Labson Freeman, Judge of the United States Regional Court, registered on Thursday, states that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from legal fees incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to reach Gilead, which controls the market with new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can be treated with over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case is in 2013, when Gilead and Merck invaded each other’s rights and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead.
The troops supported by the United States have conquered the city of Manbij from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manjib, near the border of Turkey, in North Syria, when the last extremist organization Isis fighters left the city, reports the mediator.
The SDF group of Syria's democratic forces now scattered the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
Mr Reuters, a representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages who were kidnapped by Isis's fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in possession, but we are still carrying out search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton, the President of the Democrats, announced his tax returns for 2015, showing that his and his husband's revenues were USD 10,75 million at that time and that they paid a real federal tax rate of 34,2.
In 2015, Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that he earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster cost office in the booklet, which dealt with his term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, published 10 years of tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, in his communication.
The opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
It is common practice that the US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even though they do not require that law.
New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers have bet on the audit of the tax administration and say it as a reason why Trump hasn't published his income information.
Your "Siirto is your" twiitta Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of the candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's specialjurisdiction assistant Michael Cohen told CNN he wouldn't let Trump release his tax information until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Presidential candidate for the Republic of 2012 Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relationships and many other links to which relations with Russia are also included.
Clinton has taken this issue and published a video online on Friday, where he presents the spectacular republicans, who make Trum publicise his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every candidate for President has done for decades and has not made public tax returns", said Clinto to the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay any taxes or pay just a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business colonel quoted a number of tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have become the key issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named by a billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the main office of Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump's meeting, where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subjected to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua in New York City, paid the real federal tax by an average of 32% in 2007-2014 and the actual combined tax rate paid by them was around 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low cost index investment fund, and the Clintons announced the dividend and interest income of USD 109 000.

Child powder fillets in support of the protection of elephant in Tanzania
Natural Protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephant away from the human dwelling — elephants are aroused by throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The project has proved effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation invented the idea, together with the US Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching volunteers in the North European villages how people can protect their homes and farmed elephants without harming their elephants.
Some other time ago, spears were used to shak the elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen the attitudes in these villages, since the villagers can now trust that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Managing Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruder elephant is embarrassed by showing the flashlight and playing the storm.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw the so-called chilip.
The chili powder mixed in the soil is put in a condom together with a twist, and then the head of the condom is circulated so that only the combustion wire is excluded.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom is exploding and spreading a fine chili powder cloud in the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive away the elephant.
The last way to do this is to shoot the fireworks known as a Roman candle and produce a loud and clear explosion.
Jewish cinema director criticizes the Berlin hotel to remove the Israeli orientation number from the Arab "management" – RT News
The French, root Jewish cinema director, after exposing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's directional number in his country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the holocaust Shoah document, frustrated in the Berlin Hotel of Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
At his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the guide number offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it hadn't existed?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation of the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann writes the answer to the receptionist shocked him.
The respondent said that the removal of Israel from the list was "the decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the measure was still shocking the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand to remove Israel's direction number."
The German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the case was a "great shame".
"The death shocks and shocks us all.
It's a huge shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
That's all we need.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a response to the network where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski hotel to simply give up the claimed demands of Arab customers.
"Fuck" was said in a publication that brought up the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the denials of the hotel quickly, calls what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The supreme order to leave Israel out of the list of directions has never been given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, the representative of the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the direction number has subsequently been added to the list.
The police used tears gas and rubber bullets in demonstration of Brazilian students
Students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s education system.
The police used tears against tears and rubber bullets.
When the law enforcement authorities tried to dismantle a group of students, the police used rubber bullets and tears.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their shock to the plans of the government took part in the demonstration.
Governor of Sao Paulo's state, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a savings measure, with almost 100 public schools being closed and 300 000 students being placed in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on the walls where Michel Temer was temporarily opposed.
The demonstration of students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with the demonstrators of the separated President Dilma Rousseff in the vote of the Senate on the prosecution of the country.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT business
Following the removal of sanctions, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Iranian ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Russia companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The growing of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, the trade exchange between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 % compared to the same period in 2015, and increased to $856 million.
"Russian exports to Iran, in particular, rose rapidly by 91.5%, to USD 697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
The sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons was accelerated by the trade," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record of Iranian seats to travel to Russia this year.
"In the last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries of tourists travelling to Russia.
It is not too dare to say that the record of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, and the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," she says.
Scotter Callum Skinner was going to the goal of winning British bike gold
Callum Skinner, Scotland, would have a reputation at the men's teamprint on Rio's velodrom last night, when the UK Trinity defended the championship earned in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner, Glasgow, was in the anchor role he inherited from his country Sir Chris Hoy, a Scottish Sir. The young man made the legend proud when he thanked the goal and captured the victory from the New Zealand team.
Great Britain took a surprise win four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic Games.
And they repeated the trick after they were only placed in the sixth races of motorcycles in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had left her career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, specializing in the role of the first driver.
Hindes just showed up at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the career also left the hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scotland Skinner was a man to whom British coachs believed and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy with the championship four years ago won Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record at time, but in the first round of New Zealand was faster.
And the British Trinity won gold in a double fight.
Hindes was quite behind after his round, but Kenny was working on the team's leadership that Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was the change of the strategy in such a way that Hindes drove to slow down at a larger gear, allowing Kenny and especially Skinner to keep speed.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached Skinner's, Kenny's and Hindes' eyes when they stepped into the award.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by a match.
I was just trying to do my best and to succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the final, and we won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London 2012, Hindes admitted with Kenny and Hoy that he deliberately fell on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he canceled his word, and the British competitors had no way of complaining.
This time, there were no problems with the sovereignty victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like London, all the British flags were in the view room.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world champions that the victory in the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for the country, which won seven of ten tracks in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure for progress made over the last five months, five days will be successful with velodrom.
As Kenny has shown his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympic golds in the Olympics.
This would mean avoiding the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
Medals would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's gonna compete in a sprint that starts today and solves in three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only enjoy this.
The team race is always the best.
You'll enjoy the victory with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to get the value of the knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doulll were the fastest in the four-man team.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London 2012 and winning gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (clock 22.42) will be raced today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of the attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Last night, he had a dispute with the competition suppliers before the time she was driven, when the suppliers invited him to measure her length.
In the corresponding women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record of 4:13.260.
The British team can now trust that its mighty roaming team will take responsibility for the mid-stage of the Olympics and bring a series of medals to the country.
Expectations before Rio have been underestimated since the truly exceptional evidence from the full leadership in Beijing and London.
There have been some drama on which Shane Sutton, the technical leader, is not dismissed in April in the midst of the arguments related to sexism and harassment, and the ending of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton's competitors.
However, the competitions held at velodrom on the first night show that the legendary reputation of the United Kingdom to the top will be realised again at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland melting plant at stake due to the conclusion of the electricity contract
The future of the Aluminium Solid House in Portland, in Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers are at risk when the power company operating electricity for the melting plant told me that one of the owners of the factory is about to dismantle the supply contract and is expected to terminate all delivery contracts.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the aid in which the plant will be operated.
The fixed, 20-year aid will cease in November.
Alcoan Portland is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Due to legalisations, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
Snowball effect can continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting plant is losing money, and there's a danger of shutting down his doors.
Measures are responsible for the future of the factory for years of speculations, first caused by the strong dollar in Australia and recently the production price of the factory.
The AGL, which provides electricity to a large aluminium alloy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects that the other three owners of the melting plants will also cease their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is the joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that the Portland plant will continue to operate, which means that physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
The AGL tells us that the contracts are so-called ‘deposit contracts’, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period is 12 months, so they end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects contracts to produce income in 2017," says the power plant.
The potential impact of return on the AGL from 2018 onwards is currently limited by strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL has already said that it has reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million as a "preliminary to the termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements is "not affecting Alcoa ... the capacity of the melting plant to operate or secure the supply of electricity to the melting area".
The American company said that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now been withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation of the industry, analysts have been cautious in their assessments of both the melting plant in Portland in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, the Managing Director of the AGL, told the analysts in his previous week that Portland uses about 600 megawatt electricity and about 900 megawatt at annual level.
"If these plants leave the market, this means a significant decline in demand (electricity) markets.
For us as a producer, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashianit TV star Kendall as a cover girl in September Vogue
The model belonging to the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous number of September of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, a promotional face of Estee Lauder, presented in the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Beholding the cannine in the room full of my dearest, he made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The publishing of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps only by the Kardashianit style?), a manuscript video, where all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (baarihäirs Rob and Caitly and all the favourite Uncle Kardashianit producer Ryan Seacrest) appeared to have forgotten their sister's coverage. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plan is cliché, and it is used in almost all the periods of the program's birthday (Seacrest says: "You thought we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the drawing character of the children's morning TV), but Kris had to get other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
For the performance in the Vogue number of September means no doubt a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall’s big sister Kim could have reached Vogue’s action before (in Vogue’s case with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite its own.
The number of September is the most sold publication of Vogue in a year.
The number reminding the fashion paper attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site from Fashion decreased that last year's 832 page guide contains 615 pages of advertisements).
The publication of the cover star of September is expected so intensely that in the previous two years, the images of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement was made.
Previously on September, cover models were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more famous than the models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and the Dior Advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and even if he first reads among the fames that work on the model, he is still in a pretty good association.
These fames are not relatives of well-known people, real-TV stars or modern children who know how to do a good Snapchat video (but Jenner is all of these).
They are rightly called talented women who are more successful in the entertainment sector than others.
Last year, Beyonce, in the cover picture, has one of the strongest years of her career, when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his real TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a stubborn.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "cups".
These emotions have reappeared when the news of Jenner's presence on Vogue cover came out.
However, continuing inconvenience seems insignificant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model of the vogue number in September.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking on Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the commercial face of Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of himself through payment applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he filmed to the Love magazine.
And in his leisure time, he's on the real TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centres turn 160 000 people away a year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the country's most vulnerable are turned away from the legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impacts that additional cuts will already have on the extreme centres.
The majority of them are older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified expulsions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal assistance services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for additional cuts of the appropriations.
Since next June, legal aid centres are at risk of losing up to 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, states that the latest calculation report by the National Association of Legal Assistance Centres suggests that thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres annually.
If the federal government doesn't twist its decision, Farrell says that the situation will just get worse.
"Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centres are constantly under-funded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"Personal relationships, people under the uncontrolled and impaired debt burden, families resigning, unjustified redundant workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Föderation Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of weakest people in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, so that these cuts will be handed over immediately so that people can receive the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal assistance to the national average level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their customers, and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
The Donald Trump campaign was challenged by an action on the threat of an employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was brought against an action when no action was expected to be taken after it had been informed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun when they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in the application, which was raised by Vincent Bordini's former programme instructor at the State Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini says that he has waited months for the situation to be dealt with within the campaign before he realized, according to his own words, that this will not happen.
Bordini says in his application that the campaign director, Earl Phillip, "he pulled out a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe to Vincent's knee limp."
After complaining to the local and regional management of the complaint, Bordini was informed that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the gun doesn't fire, it's causing damage," says Bordini in his action.
The action will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general anger when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second step" – with arms owners and advocates – may take action if his opposing candidate Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to choose judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his word from the context, and Trump did not inspire violence in his words.
In his actions, Bordini calls for compensation from the campaign for the uninterrupted result and Phillip's compensation for assault, assault and mental suffering.
Mr. Trump's reporter, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the message that asked him for a comment.
Phillip wasn't reached despite the companies.
Charlotte's local news office, WCCB, told me that Phillip recently left a campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call submitted to the Phillip Consultation Company, the Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
UK must use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not just in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was the fact that was most interested in Heathrow, as in the Olympics in London in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of apprenticeship and 40 000 new jobs, thereby removing youth unemployment in the neighbouring areas of the airport.
Like the Olympics in London in 2012, there are always people who think that Heathrow's expansion is too big a challenge.
With regard to the Olympics, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be faced with an embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
But Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits not just a few people.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a great working group in Heathrow, which has carried out in time and by keeping in the budget an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion, including the T5 terminal, which has been voted for the best flight terminal of the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal built in the middle of the world's most congestive runway.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway with a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Government and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Adblock in a cat-hire game
The attempts of companies earning their money from online advertising to dismantle advertising prevention software have become a cat-hiir game, says a company producing preventive programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced that it would prevent advertising recording programs, Adblock Plus published a blog paper where it told users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent community service advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that he would change the label codes of advertisements on his desktop site so that it would be more difficult to identify the sections of the page.
But now Adblock says he's cleared the new codes.
Adblock’s journalist Ben Williams wrote in his blog that "this kind of ballet between the open source code between the Adblock Advertising Community and the disguisers has been running since the ad prevention was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon do its own repair business again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisingers have formed in the sector.
It is estimated that 200 million people use advert prevention programs worldwide, reports the survey carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure is almost fourfolded since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile appliances daily, with 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in dismantling advertising programmes in its desktop application, as the reporter says that the blocking of mobile advertising programmes do not work in Facebook's mobile applications and instagrams.
The income from Desktop advertising remains sufficient and therefore Facebook considered the contribution to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it was updating the user settings advertising tool so that users could better control how advertisements are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent the display of some normal Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook journalist in his e-mail communication.
"The prevention programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and therefore we have invested in developing user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
She committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on a Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police ask for eyewitness help on the motorway on Thursday’s first hour of accident, where a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaudi Canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman was desperate to do what she did by laying down on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, reports Vaud's police when she announced.
The victim was an 49-year-old Swiss woman, and he was clearly trying to commit suicide, and one of the overtime cars was a truck.
She died at the scene of the event.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some of them are still unidentified.
Lawman Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneve that criminal investigations have been launched, which is a logical step in such a situation.
It is, however, to be seen whether prosecuted against drivers involved in the accident.
"Did the collision be avoided?
It will remain for the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have taken place over the last five years, according to which drivers are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked in the dark road and the court decided that the drivers cannot wait to hit their footsteps on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from the charge against him after he encountered a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22 - year - old victim had had been drinking a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court considered that the police — who was in response to an emergency call — had a reasonable way of driving and that the man lying on the road — was "the most exceptional and unpredictable situation".
On Thursday, someone who knows about the accident near Morges is asked to call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to the NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study the past of Venus with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to that of the earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas chamber is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous researchers, Venus’ slow rotation rate is explained by its thick gas circuit.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere equivalent to the earth and has been slowly rotating.
The model was also used to identify the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent creepy.
"In the modeling of the GISS, Venus spins slowly and its day-to-day is almost two months at a time," says the GISS researcher, Anthony Del Genio, in the press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like the umbrella and protects the surface from large parts of the sun heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even few degrees lower than the present Earth temperatures.
The model created a story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary researchers for its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the steamed water.
In the water quarantine, there was only a thick carbon gas framework and a lethal greenhouse effect — i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's giving up his place as the coach of Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as the coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice president of the association's hockey activities, insisting on the lack of impact on the team's decision-making potential.
Colorado Vice-CEO/Chairman Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the association would immediately start to apply for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been doing my job as the chief coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice president of the association's hockey activities firmly, passionately and determinedly," says Roy 50-year-old.
"In the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vice-chair manager of the coach and the association of hockey activities shall be fully on the same lines as the organisation.
He must also be able to express decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League year from his first period as the head coach of Avalanche 2013-2014.
With his leadership, the company reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't been able to make it over the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the 2015-2016 period and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild at the other Wild Card conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanchen rows.
Oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and stop strike
The main negotiators say that the Oil Workers' strikes in the North Sea are interrupted when all the parties in the dispute are taking part in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been swept against the drilling boilers of the Royal Dutch Shell, located in the North Sea.
According to the joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reoperate the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of the next week, we will have several whole-day meetings for the next few weeks, dealing with recent issues.
Professional unions justified their recent activities, which they said were the first for more than 25 years, as a protest for possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9% of its contractors' tariffs in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows the calculation of the prices of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, additional surgery will provide him with a space of movement that is necessary in order to cope with the downturn of the market.
On the other hand, Shell has cut down thousands of employees from his salary and has announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to improve its activities after the mega fusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Lower raw oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision of the United Kingdom in June to leave the European Union, which creates pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish MEP, met the working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest working controversies that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that has an advantage for many and not just a few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be using less than EUR 1.4 billion in 2016 when around $7 billion have been spent over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejadian Star Team
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotation rate of stars, which has helped astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the rotation speeds of the stars of the Plejadian Stars.
On the basis of new information, astronomers will be able to figure out why the stars in the same group rotate at different speeds and how the circular times relate to the planet.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other Star Forces, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Caltech University of Pasadena, a researcher at the Infrared Treatment and Analysis Centre.
The starship of the Plejades is located 445 light years from the earth.
Many stars were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just about reaching their adult age.
They're running faster than ever at the moment.
While the speed of rotation is at the top of the adult stars, large numbers of stars are released from the wind.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they proceed through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of the identifiable stars (e.g. sunlights).
The latest catalogued speed data indicate that larger stars rotate slowly than smaller.
Rebull compares the stars with the dancers — the bigger circulating slowly than the smaller ones.
"We see the "dance of the Plejad" that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spinners are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejadian starship is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars in relation to the speeds of rotation.
Rebull says, "The group of stars offers a pillar for the theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why the stars slow their speed and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Plejadi speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
