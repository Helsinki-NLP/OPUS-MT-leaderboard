The victory of the populists on the right, in Austria, they have 29 percent
The weakening of the two parties of the great coalition so far and the significant increase of the populist parties on the right has been made, according to the first preliminary results, on the Sunday of the Austrian predecessor parliamentary elections.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President, Wilhelm Molterer's position, was seriously affected, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the other hand, President of the Alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Chairman of the province of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is prepared to return to national policy.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Socialist Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but has lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP lost nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in the after-war history of Austria, and, in particular, the results of the predecessor elections are literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, at the end of the ÖVP coalition, the folk party had a significant advantage before SPÖ, according to public opinions.
However, the electorates were clearly punished because they let the government fail.
In the first responses to the results, speculations have already been expressed on the possible resignation of Wilhelm Molterer's party and current alkancellar.
The observers believe that this can take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Party.
This development would probably facilitate a more likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewing of the SPÖ and ÖVP large coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two populists on the right - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) has received 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ has acquired eleven percent of the votes - yet the Social Democrats have expressed their fear of repeating the year 1999 when the People's Party agreed on a joint government with the populations (the FPÖ was still united in 2005, the BZÖ), which has even prejudged sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume he can return to Vienna into national policy, is obviously expecting this solution.
The Green Party, which, however, had some loss of popularity, has returned from the third place to the fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the 4 percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The Indian Relations can get cold.
If you were unable to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who were unlawful for collecting bugs, Karel Schwarzenberg, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, says that there would be some delay in the Czech-India relations.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherji, an Indian partner today.
"If this had not been solved, yes, there would be a certain amount of humiliation," he said after the meeting, which was made by Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherjii said that the executive power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that, in the case of Petr Švácha, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeelingi, whose law is the case.
"Her problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera to be sentenced to prison for three years, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for the release of the bail and wait for the sentence to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"It was recommended to appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him," said the Czech head of diplomacy.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is by the Czech party, to provide "competent legal support" to the convict, mentioned the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party already provided such assistance.
"Our main interest with India is to preserve the best relations with many years of traditions.
This is also recognised by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as you told ČTK, the Czech Republic stressed its partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"In fact, we consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists a serious mistake," he declared.
The question is whether the Indian party has promised to deal with the case, the Minister has ruled out the answer.
"Although I have received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
He goes to the wall electronic map, on which Australia and neighbouring maritime areas can be seen.
However, he does not care about the ground, but is a point that disappears in the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with the neighbouring seabeds.
During the area, it is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty members of the United Nations Division's Sea and Sea Law Workers' Group.
Chief Václav Mikulka, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation that is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm are dominated here.
The seabed is a rich world of natural resources, which has not yet been known.
There may be oil, coal and other minerals, but still unknown living organisms, such as the development of the anti-cancer medicine.
Seabed greater than sealands
Coastal states are currently intensively seeking new sea areas.
According to the UN Convention, their rights are enforced, which were agreed in Montego Bay in 1982.
It is primarily about the so-called continental landscape, which often extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
According to the Convention, such a country has a exclusive right to all sources of the continental soil.
"Simplified, we keep the part of the seabed of the continental soil, and the layer below, which is the natural continuation of the sea underground.
The coastal coastal borders, often two hundred miles so. It goes beyond the economic zone alone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission appointing the external borders of the Continental Land shall be accompanied by a number of extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has negotiated five requests so far, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three countries mentioned have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
In the world, Australia’s recent success has created an echo, first of all, significantly expanding its sea underground country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the seabed that the committee has judged is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. six times the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed will be unpredictable.
Other countries also keep submitting their requests.
They can do this within ten years of the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
At the end of the continental soil, the territory of the "common heritage of humanity" of the Convention begins.
There's no one country here alone.
The right to extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"But the bottom of the sea is not Klondike," says overly Director Mikulka saying, "some areas are legally circumvented and their regime is established in a contract."
Czech on the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now the Czech Republic.
This former East block is divided into other countries in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal".
This organisation received the so-called "router investor" status, like investors in some other countries in 1991 under the Convention.
It has been authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribat in the Pacific.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a copy of the Tatra underwater.
"The total area of 75 000 square kilometres can be grown.
The area is a rich location of polymetal ores containing nickel, resin, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a co-worker of the division Macedon, presents an example of a concrecy.
A potato or a little fantasy reminds me of a pergamen with Gólemet's magic words to life.
German special forces were present at hostage release
The Egyptian government asked for help to solve the hostage crisis from Germany - and the professionals came.
When the situation became a problem, the special units were ready, but they did not take place.
Eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are increasingly being released.
Indirectly, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Airport and the Federal Criminal Office's staff and the Logistics experts of the German Technical Service were also on the site of release.
According to the information from the Ministry’s spokesmen on Monday evening, the German forces were nevertheless necessary because the hostages had allowed their prisoners to run, and then escaped when they recognized the signs of violent hostages.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as an on-the-spot support force.
"That's not fortunate," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers were abducted in the southern part of Egypt in five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian women and eight Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt, the hostages were dragged here in the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remains unclear until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom fees.
In the meantime, the saviors arrived safely to Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that liberated hostages are protected by the German embassy.
He didn't report the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information was provided on their return to Germany.
According to "Bild", five tourists and special forces arrive on the German Air Force Airbus plane to Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. Parliament rejects the rescue package.
The subcongress of the US Congress has failed the 700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets with a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell in the deep.
The U.S. Parliament rejected the government's rescue package by 227 votes against 206.
Despite the invitations made by President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, he did not receive a majority of the program that was intended to control chaos in the financial markets.
Supporters were desperately urged to convince critics of the necessity of the $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called on the Members to support it, even if the plan is even unpopular.
"Now to obtain political support to avoid something that hasn't even occurred" he acknowledged.
Dow Jones still fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Because the investors were worried that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then the failure to make it public again.
Experts account for further serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to enter into force the programme, approval of both the Assembly and the Senate is necessary.
The directors register more and more bookings.
Good winter is a promise for German travel organisers.
According to a study, the traffic of road reservations for the next few months increased significantly compared to the previous year, by over 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans' traveling pleasures were not considered to be unsuccessful.
During the winter season reservations, travel agencies accounted for 31 percent increases in traffic compared to the previous year's period - presented on Monday in Berlin, the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the study of the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of autumn months has already been higher.
The traffic of travel agencies in October was 11 percent higher than October 2007, reported by the DDRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which assesses the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account busy trips by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the USA was particularly sought - DRV reported.
Here the size of the reservations increased by one third round.
The Germans are also particularly fond of their destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their home landscapes.
Mostly the organized roads were searching - said Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
Due to the increasing energy and food costs, the costs for organised roads can be "betterly calculated for passengers than for individually organised trips".
Among other things, passengers can save money with reservation preferences or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so, compared to the previous year, traffic increases can be recorded again - although, according to another study, less German tourists have undertaken to travel compared to the previous year.
My first Oktober painting
Without a break, repeated ballermann slagers, literal slabs of beer and design of dirndlit are famous.
Wiesnen's debriefing.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are actually not much like each other.
He's a blonde, TV show leader, and he's wearing a customized dirndle.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the furnace.
One thing, however, is connected: We have been in Wiesnen for just three minutes, we are already run by photographers and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all this at my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we get friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north, my comfort is still bound by the population.
But coming to Theresienwies, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndlit or leather pants; no one looks reluctant or embarrassed - everything is perfectly okay.
Weird look at the chocolate banana stand is only my dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I've wrongly bound the bazooka: "You're free in the middle of a virgin, you're right, you're a widow in the back."
I'm secretly bound to the left of the massene from behind.
"That's good," says and laughs.
Others have less flushing around fine flirting techniques and carry a simple philosophy, "I'm too drunk to dress up," and they want to show their naked ass.
The young man who shows exhibitions is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, long-distanced with "aaaaa".
All this after he tells me he's gotten rid of the content of his formerly drunk corn.
Right next to one of the firefights that everyone looks like garbage dogs.
So Bob's one of the notorious "inhibitors"
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Eight o'clock tonight, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of the poor couples.
Patient nurses always appear in a team, four at once carrying a covered barrel from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure sticks filled.
Who's lying in the alcohol cologne under the pony doesn't seem to be.
"They are who are completely ready" - yell to me one of the sanits on my question and then in the film member.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who got hit by a vehicle in Essex county and died in the hospital.
The resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, was on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, the city.
He was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested by suspicion of negligible driving.
He's been released for bail since then.
Turkey's broad diplomatic horizon
A long time before Turkey had wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were burning from the desire to deepen into Turkey's backland.
On the east side of Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed empire.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neorenesan style.
At least that's what travelbooks say.
The building is surrounded by the end of the parlors, a tower in each of the front corners, and it looks like a German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little shaky.
However, in the light of the inside of the store ticket office, it is obvious that this was the Westernest gate of a large-scale company.
The station was opened by the German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "prevention of conquerions" from this Damascus to Bagdadon, has attempted to achieve its ambitions to take over the Middle East with the help of the railway leading to today's Saudi Arabia.
The German reigns collapsed during World War I.
Railway lines were attacked by Lawrence and Arab partisans in Arabia.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army exited Egypt and expelled the Turkishs and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station wasn't any better.
In 1917, a firearm train blew up and destroyed the building's well-designed roof.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it's been slowly ruined, and it's been over history.
At the same time today, as the gateway of the Danube and the entire Eastern region, at least symbolically, serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Party of Justice and Development on the Government - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government is building good relations with Israel and Syria, the groups of Hamas and Fatah in the Palestinian Republic, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I got onto the night train to Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kinicloglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the storm, which then gave me the famous documentary about the old world, the rhythm of The Night Mail - I arrived in the capital of Turkey.
However, ACP is known to be a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus with Islamic roots.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went with taxi to the ACP chair, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building, which is specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburb, half-ready shopping centres and cafés. These are the latter in the suited middle leaders - men and women - to make business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have added it to a better-centered politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a dress, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is to help Turkey reintegrate into a direct environment.
The Cold War upset the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its backland.
Today, he had to go to the east and west at the same time.
He couldn't have chosen one of the two.
He had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that he should be forced to take a election sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to get in the way."
He then underlined what almost everyone I talked to here, and then it repeated mechanically: Turkey is not only in the Middle East, but also in relations with the countries surrounding the Caucasus and the Black Sea for the same benefit to Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
It's like they're trying to send a message that, in a transmissible sense, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can get to Asia and the Middle East on those rail lines east.
When I was at the station again at Hydarpasha, after another night, mostly awake, I was thinking about Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who looked through the recovery of this decorative building 100 years ago.
They would have wondered if they knew that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as soon as I was waiting for the shuttle to take you back through the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was called the "Patient Man of Europe" at the time.
At that time, at least it was not questionable which part of the country would require this exciting country.
Memorable life trips: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologer, sept 11.) led the Philharmonic Zenekart and Chorus in Guildford as director of Guildford.
Based on his musical plans for the city, he founded a wonderful youth choir, Proteus, next year.
In principle, only 21-year-olds could have belonged to the singer, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20s - we were simply not willing to buy it from the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformer) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any bag they put in front of - be the Madrid or a Messianic piece; without escort, or with the escort of the great-zenekar.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazed and always exciting, and it was because of the man whose inspiration of music has remained unchanged during the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "Let the music speak from himself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it!"
His master's technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never dictatorical or exaggerating.
Whatever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If you've ever lived a driver who was supposed to be hit by a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I was familiar with him in the two decades during which he led the Philharmonics in Guildford from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I wrote criticisms about more than 100 concerts, but never, never caused any disappointment, and often disappointed them.
Tod Handley had the size and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the drivers who, living with his words, were simply "a few well-known battles all over the world."
Many of us will miss you.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to William Woodruff's necreologist (25 September), "he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became the scholarship of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly prepared to obtain the basic degree, the Master's Diploma and the PhD title."
This is from the authors of Woodruff's work on Beyond Nab End, but false.
Between 1946 and 1953, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was then issued in 1958 under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers.
In 1950-51, he was actually in the US with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 he was at Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff was decorating this time of his career.
J. Vicente Resino on the Wizard
I recommend the exhibition "J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because the pictures of black-white, documentary style are impressive.
The simplicity and strength of them and respect for the people in the photographs attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be over emotions.
"Resino's good enough to bring the magical moments back."
Secondly, the sales record at Honda
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of Jazz.
It is true that his predecessor has already had a large number of roads, but the development of the new model is even more spacious.
All of this is coupled with a sophisticated mechanism that makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution vs revolution.
That's what the second generation of Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the view of the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor, it has been made many internal changes.
These include, for example, the innovative design, the new corridor, the larger sizes and the new mechanism.
But before we go over to a detailed description of the new model, we need to say that the new Jazz came to the market for six years after the first generation.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is also less well-known, but it decides on sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, Japan, where in 2002, and this year in 2008, Jazz was the most wanted car market.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces have been sold from Jazz since they entered the market.
The second market was Old Continent, with almost half a million copies sold over six years.
However, the Honda would like to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
As in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83.000 Jazz, the estimates for 2009 aim to sell 100,000 cars, which would lead to an increase of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda sold 8000 pieces of Jazz, this represents 6.7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated by a copy sold during the course of a year 2000.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly relieve the decline in the traffic of Honda in Spain.
Because the company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents 4,000 lower than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% last year compared to 1.6%.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
The Honda hopes that you can achieve this with the introduction of a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact - size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces a year in the world.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's market distribution would be made by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be divided between Old Continens and Japan.
Insight's commercial introduction is due in the first months of the year after the official training presentation scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all respects.
It has a length of 3900 mm (five cents longer), a width of 1690 mm (two centimetres wide) and axle distance of 5 centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger space has become more spacious.
The larger internal space is the new corridor, and the central fuel tank guarantees - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total warehouse of double flooring, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres, has increased its capacity in the first generation.
Although this includes that these sizes apply to the type 1,4 engine, since Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be found, such as rear-down lamps or optional panoramic glass roofs, and easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees compared to the first opening angle of Jazz 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are new.
At the beginning of its operation, this small model can be ordered with two, 1,2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both resource consumption is more favourable with its previous model and is characterised by lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while at the same time the engine provides an increased performance in all respects.
The power of the 1,2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds and maximum torque at 114 Nm 4900 turns.
This engine - which was 78 horsepowers in the previous Jazz - consumed 5.3 litres and CO2 emissions were 125 grams.
The other engine, which generated 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horse-powered 1,4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The bump-by-passing "mear car"
To develop accidental preventive technologies, Nissan is this time of nature, precisely the inspiration of the bees' world to a new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the bees.
Perhaps the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step to develop anti-rotation technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co. developed Technical Centre built this robot in Japan in collaboration with the advanced Research Centre for Research and Technology at the University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Director-General for Technological PR and Research and Development, BR23C means further extension of Nissan's four-level security cover.
The robot makes the company's products more able to crash.
During the flight, all bees create their own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan's safety cover.
However, the role of the bee is much more important than that of a complex eye with which it sees at a angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, the bee can fly in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a laser gauge (Laser Range Finder).
The device shall identify the obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C, calculate their distance and send a signal to the deck microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid impact.
"As soon as an obstacle is detected, the small robot, imitating the movements of the bee, changes the direction immediately by moving the wheels to a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the currently available instruments that in this case the avoiding manual is fully automatic.
If it weren't, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project chief engineer.
In a different way than the bees, the avoiding manoeuvre must not be directed upwards or downwards, and can not move in a straight line, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in the way that happens in the case of bees.
That's why Nissan in the robot was also using a rotation function outside the acceleration and the slowdown to avoid impacts.
"This structure should only process the data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need for storage of data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can only work with dozens of KB memory without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about memories of Megabyte.
This is the first step to develop a technology for immediate impact prevention, which, according to Nissan's estimates, can be included in serial cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer accumulators that are easier and more lasting than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system can be an additional application to deliver the car to the end target by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We must admit that the US Treasury Department has a lot of investable cash and has no sense of reason.
Since the crisis is on their necks, and that the Americans should not be able to get into the drivers of the mortgage bank, they created a fun and informative online game of the "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Hotel of Bad Loans", that's the Galibians.
The design of the accommodation and, in particular, the receptional diving chamber suggests that we should rethink it, twice, even three times, whether the time for borrowing has just come.
And especially where we need credit, because it's probably the purpose of this thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the audience.
But what would happen if we were to add to the game?
For example, the hotel would appear in our dream room.
Actually, that's something, because we don't even dare dream about buying a place...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG.
Morgan Stanley announced that he would share his capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank pays $9 billion for 21% of the capital of the company after the Morgan Stanley shares fell in the stock exchange.
One week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a unit price of $25, i.e. $3 billion.
The accepted price will be over 19% off the value of the securities according to the book of 31 August.
The MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide a 10% return, and their conversion rate will be USD 31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price dropped by greenwichi at about 17.79% in the middle of the year, and it closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation of bankholding companies", explains John Mack, Director General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which allows you to diversify its activities, but will be subject to the control of the Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reaffirms that the current financial crisis demands even more caution from the company giants registered on Wall Street.
The conditions notified on Monday show otherwise that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only announced 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for around $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely part of tribal shares", explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, because of the current market and economic situation, we would have wanted to minimise and protect possible risks.
In view of the weighted average price, MUFG pays more than 7% of the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on one share decreases by about 20%.
Under the agreement, the MUFG may switch half of its priority shares into shares where the trading rate of the latter exceeds more than 50% over a given period, i.e. about USD 47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that funds from MUFG can make use of investment opportunities, improve balance sheets and increase liquidity resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide accurate information on the two new alliance strategic plans.
After MUFG joined, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has stated that his consideration has been "definitely" improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been faced with a major attempt, as its stocks fell to half, while the cost of insurance against the risk of non-payment has fled to the heavens.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained at a high level of about 12%.
One of the large investor banks remained the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and after the purchase of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs reported last week that it had reached $15 billion: part of it comes from the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Statement by Rafael Correa Monday, Quito
Restructuring the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is a joint plan for Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.
Following the model of his presidents and friends on Sunday, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted in the referendum on the basis of the official results of 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted with a vote, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of their voters were dissolved.
50% + 1 votes were needed to adopt the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the expulsion of the voting offices and counting by a civil society have both proven the huge surplus of 'yes' votes with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on Monday nights.
"The Constitution has gained an extreme victory", and he thanked the ecuadorians at Guayaquil, the governor's office, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As well as the public is aware, Chávez Rafael Correa, Morales and Chairman in Chile, Michelle Bachelet was also congratulated.
According to the report by the United States Organisation for Observatory (OAS), the vote was in a calm atmosphere. It was the main subject of a 444 precise text comprising the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed constitution imposes state powers on the economy, maintaining the State's right to "development" for a country which is essentially from oil extraction by foreign companies and from the currency sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who may receive a mandate for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to take advantage of this opportunity and in February 2009 he will again compete for the Head of State.
The Constitution has also included the freeness of health services and education, which has already begun to introduce it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population is living under the minimum of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which may end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an ecuador ecu facility to base anti-drug measures in the United States.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
Egyptian troopers hit him on the kidnappers who took ten days ago hostages of ten tourists and eight of their escorts.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
Eleven European tourists and eight of their Egyptian companions were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported to the Egyptian capital injuriously on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad this morning by a Egyptian commander.
Obviously in good condition, they arrived with an airplane at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the international airport in Cayro.
The hostages were forbidden to report to the press and immediately transferred them to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthful" and the kidnappers were "not paid a ransom" - declared at the airport Zoheir Garanna, Egyptian Minister for Tourism.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of the mountain of Ouanat in the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in a terrain safarin. Then the group was dragged from one of the 35 unknown hostages to the other.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) as well as eight Egyptians: two tourists, four drivers, one border guard, and the director of the A Egyptian travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security manager, a 30-member special commander has arrived on two helicopters at the scene where they were hit on the hostages directly before the sky.
"There was a firefight among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others escaped," said the leader who asked for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special teams were sent from the Egyptian Flash Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian troops were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, underlined the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this result could not have been achieved without professional and effective involvement of our secret service men and action groups", he announced without further details.
He also denied that they would have paid a ransom for the hostages.
Last day, the Sudanian army announced that during the patrol, a fieldman was arrested, on which the kidnappers traveled, and six of them (including Chad's leader) were killed, and two were arrested.
According to the military, hostages were related to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately confronted by the organisation concerned.
Lettres - The culture is "the quiet majority"
The debate on the financing of culture is at the heart of the newspaper news and the election campaign that is currently taking place.
We can only be happy about this.
But they're still forgetting a part of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, journals, archaeological digestions and national historical monuments?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and his buildings that are part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros to restore the castle in the Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Quebec History Association, over 40,000 volunteers in history research and the preservation of large numbers of private archaeological and archaeological findings are working with a minimum budget within the framework of 211 history, cultural heritage, journalism and genealogy.
These organizations often protect our teeth-round inheritance and protest with the last strength of the drowning, when real estate developers and decision-makers guide their bullions to our old buildings and forgotten cemetery.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historic and cultural heritage?
The Benelux governments are dismantling part of Fortis bank.
The Benelux States contribute to partial nationalisation because of the impact of the US credit market crisis on the first European bank in Belga, Fortison: the three countries support a financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interest, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's responsibility for competition.
In the euro area, the Bank of Fortis is the first major crisis in the context of an international financial market crisis that has been ringing over a year, and the decisions taken in the case of the bank can therefore be considered to be a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the bank’s existing property is purchased in nearly half of the three States (49 percent).
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Netherlands ABN Amró last year, especially insurers.
Fortis' shares last week began to fall steeply, and in the second half of the week there were serious crises in the Institute.
However, the analyses agree that the bank’s 85 000 employees are too large to allow bankruptcy.
The company's papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years of age.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to company managers, this is not realistic.
The corporate leadership, by the way, caused overseas market uncertainties about the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion for Fortis.
On Monday, the papers have already risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new CEO to the front of the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private customers, but no one has ever checked in with a valuable offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
The bank's clients have not paniced so far, the drawers have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has separate branches and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance providers often refuse to make a insurance contract with the applicant based on human pharmaceutical data.
Data protection professionals fear that the market for data becomes uncheckable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of pharmacovigilance data in all cases to the consent of the person concerned.
This must be in an independent hand, otherwise we'll trust the chicken cockroach," quotes Richard Dick, the development of a program that can follow pharmaceutical prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurers shall depend on the health status of the applicant client on the amount of the insurance premium and the amount of the damages, and if they consider the risk too high, they shall not even be insured with it.
They used to send the person to a medical examiner, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Dick has developed a much cheaper procedure for ten years: the pharmaceuticals easily obtain what kind of medicine he has bought in the last half of the year, and the program itself concludes what kind of disease he has and what his health condition is.
For example, if you take a high dose of cholesterol inhibitors regularly, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually high, which are now classified into a higher risk category.
A number of versions of the programme are also available, some of which also define a risk multiplier number, so the insurance company will not be doing anything but paperwork, although there are little difficulties.
The disadvantages are that some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as some compounds can be used against migraine or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-producing factor for business insurance, not the latter.
The data were collected and processed by special companies, and before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, they ask for the patient's consent.
They are now bound by the authorities, although no punishment has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies are already working on the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but it covers only health care providers and insurers.
Before the Congress there is a proposal for a law which also gives the authorities control over the reporting companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: that is why he has further developed his programme, which would involve the transmission of the data to the express consent of the person concerned.
Other question is that the person concerned may not refuse the contribution, otherwise insurance undertakings do not sign a contract with it.
So the chickens are all about the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Double trade between the European Union and India
As the leading trading partners of the European Union and India mutually managed the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside the other, mostly global problems.
Today will be the French-Indian summit, which will mainly be the subject of nuclear cooperation.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an up-to-date democratic great power that should be given a greater voice in international matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was thus not answered yesterday at Marseille and now at the ninth summit.
Mr Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union and President-in-Office of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mr Javier Solana, adopted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Szingh, who was also agreed to double over five years, i.e. to increase trade traffic to a hundred billion euros.
Given that the trade has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this context, the twenty-two bilateral civil aviation conventions with India were summarised in legal terms, i.e. air traffic could be winging in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the conciliation.
The aim is to balance that while the EU's first trading partner in India, Newdelhi is only in the ninth place.
The summit focused its attention on global issues.
The situation in Afghan and Pakistan and the latter in both parts of terrorism have been convicted in all forms and urged the United Nations Conference to be convened.
The ending of the Doha trade round has also been urged, although both of them have a large part of their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will last in addition to its energy and climate programme, i.e. want to reduce harmful emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a global agreement at the future climate conference and to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by fifty percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the summit of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is going to the French capital today, where the bilateral meeting is preparing to enter into a business on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they trust that the French companies will receive a commission of €20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse fair.
This year, the Frankfurt International Book Fair is awaiting 7000 outdoors from 101 countries in 171.790 square metres, where more than 403.000 books are presented.
At the Italian Pavilon opening ceremony, the Italian Government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Javas and Activities: Italy will take 264 square meters of exhibition by setting up a single Italian point.
The celebrating opening will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Buchmesse 5.0 pavilon, where there is also an opportunity to present information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the market for Italian publishers continues to decrease the proportion of foreign authors, in particular in the area of adult and youth publications.
They found the missing billionaire, Steve Fossett's plane a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane that disappeared over the Nevadan desert on 3 September 2007.
The wreckages were found in a 3000 metres high in the area of Mammoth Lakes, near the Sierra Nevada mountains on the California and Nevada border.
Human remains were not found inside the plane.
John Anderson, sheriff of Madera county, has broken down all the doubts that existed after the flight situation was established, we have sent a team, and now we can be certain that it was about the plane on the day Steve Fossett flew away", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Safety Agency (NTSB) announced that, after a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage, an investigation committee was requested to identify the machine and to establish that it was actually about the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007, the day Fossett went to a three-hour flight from Yerington to Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs on Fosset's name, issued by Illinois Federal Air Service, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was filed a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of summits to put himself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the ground with a balloon: two weeks alone flight.
Three years later, he took a plane to the ground without landing.
A number of records include flights above Andok at a height of 15,445 metres, carried out with a second pilot.
GLK, astonishing advertising
An unusual, however, original and firm-formed hobby pickup with large surfaces and clear corners.
In fact, some of Mercedes-Benz's newest "compact landscape", with which the German automotive factory tried to bring fresh fluctuations on the market.
This is precisely the result of the non-traditional content of the SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz presentation halls from 17 October will also be surprising and unusual.
This is because the advertising war accompanying the presentation of the new vehicle is using a media-communication tool that has not yet been known, including through utopist 3D posters, which have not yet been used by the car mall in Italy.
The giant plaque action, which consists of three stages, will rule the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the car's spatial effect, which will be seen in almost real sizes and in a three-dimensional form by the use of special glasses distributed in the Corso Como.
The image looker's gonna feel like the car's getting out of the poster.
After this, through innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible in a single way.
There's no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the automotive stereotype commercial world.
Can this help raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hugs are.
Young people in Triveneto, they're probably out of the field.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of all Italy? The members of the group called "Ultras Italy", who has been following the picker for years, and which, truthfully, has not caused too much trouble.
They never hooked up with the opponent's cheerleaders.
The core of the group is on the right side.
The main organisers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padova, Triest and Udina.
These were joined by small splendor groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units) in Sofia.
The Italian flags were struck, on which the home town of the cheerleaders was marked: they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English cheerleaders.
In Bulgaria, they faced a true Nazi cheerleading team, Levski's drukkers.
The Italian football council gave 144 tickets to Italian cheerleaders. These were tickets for names, making it easier to check the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: there was no process against anyone who had been banned from the stadium visit to Sofia.
Four Italian cheerleaders who have a record of football, denied tickets and exits.
At the moment, the Ministry of Home Affairs is waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police and then takes the necessary measures: the cheerleaders who have been arrested or identified during the confusion may be subjected to five years' detention.
It is an international ban on visiting not only Italy but also all the stadiums of Europe.
So our football raids can't get their legs into any football field.
Luckily.
However, we must also fear that the Huligans are found to be followers, that is, that of this fewer than fifty people, others are joining.
"At the same time, this fire must be suffocated, not to be excused by anyone who acts like this," said the Ministry of Interior.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since it's about the Wednesday game day in Lecce.
Because in Puglia there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory and the Committee on Safety of Sports, which may also be counted in one of the departments of the Internal Security Service, will meet on Tuesday.
"Duce-Duce scanning and swinging arm under the Italian anthem?
This idea was developed quite unfortunately, in Domenico Mazzilli, who has been appointed to the head of the Ministry of Interior’s Observatory a few weeks ago (the post was taken up by Francesco Tagliente, and before Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the chief police captain of Triest, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italian group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria it is not forbidden to live the Duce, but the behavior of that 150-200 cheerleader was still disgraceful.
I'm not a sociologist, he added the first man of the observation service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime is committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to keep going.
But let's also talk a little bit about the whistling of the Italian anthem: it's not a crime, but, if I may say that, it's not a prosperity."
