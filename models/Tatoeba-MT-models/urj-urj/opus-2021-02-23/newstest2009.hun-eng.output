The Prague stock exchange has ended trade in minus
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the morning's rushing crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Industry Company (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange immediately proceeded from the beginning of Tuesday's trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street's shares are falling behind the fall.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the American House, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Depreciation of shares in Asia
In the Asian stock exchanges, the dramatic fall of shares was passed on Tuesday, although some of the losses were finally erased by the indicators during the day.
The Hong Kong Sound Seng stock exchange index described almost four percent in the course of trade, but subsequently erased part of the losses and reduced the decrease to approximately 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitored Chinese shares, fell by 3.8 per cent, was closed in Shanghai.
The shares of Sydney's stock have lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock exchanges fell by 3.6 per cent according to the index there.
"The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are on the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial support proposal.
Otherwise, it is a threat that other countries can feel the consequences of this.
Bleeding of American Shares
On Monday, the American Parliament rejected the draft financial support for which $700 billion (approximately 12 billion) should have been used.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the American stocks were flooded and the leading stock indexes recorded the biggest fall over 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, a similar fall last year in 1987.
The index has already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to be free.
Congress retired: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The chief leaders of the United States Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed in the broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
They will vote on this at the beginning of next week.
In the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan, American lawmakers have broken up in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $ 700 billion (approximately 12 billion).
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can make the final form and vote of the law public.
The draft financial support scheme will be discussed at the Assembly on Monday.
On Sunday, he informed the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate resources, the draft is likely to be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
According to the public authorities, it should be announced that the rescue plan is approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be a "development".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a lot of steps.
We have resolved our different views on the form of the package to stabilise the market," said the Bloomberg Agency, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
He believes that the final vote may take place on Sunday.
The lawmakers met Henry Paulson, the US Minister of Finance on Saturday night to give a permanent form of government fund.
This should be the purchase of unsale mortgages from financial corporations that put financial corporations into serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are attached to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The remedial project needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Indication of Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are rigorous.
According to Senator Harry Reid Nevadai, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an agreement on the Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to reassure investors before the start of trade in Asian money markets, where the decision of the Congress could first affect Monday trade as a result of the time zone.
It is not yet clear, however, when the two chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, as it is not, whether the trial may not arise in the last moment because of any problem.
The legislators hope the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, there are many changes in the law.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which has been determined in $100 billion and $350 billion later if it will feel that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
While the President may defend this decision, the Congress may, however, reassess the victor.
Despite these changes, however, the programme has remained a basic concept, which was the acquisition of assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of American mortgage loans are unable to clear.
"We've all worked out.
The House should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," mentioned Senate Judd Gregg Republican Senator.
The progress made in the negotiations was also satisfied by the President of the United States of America.
Tony Fratto, spokesman of Bush, stated that the president was satisfied with the Saturday progress and appreciates "two-party efforts to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of bus end-of-life recessions
The negotiations were held by Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Bank Committee, who said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from losses, on the closure of discounts and on the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also restricts the termination of the buses by the directors involved in the programme and establishes the fund supervisory committee.
The Fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked hard on this, and we made great progress towards a agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also accounts for assistance to household owners who have problems with the debit.
In the case of mortgages purchased by the government, new debits should be agreed with the aim of reducing the monthly debits of debtors and allowing them to retain their houses.
Marek: Respiratory assistance
The proposed draft David Marek, the head of Patria Finance, says it's a good idea, but it's going to be very difficult to achieve.
"It's all because it's not possible to know what kind of mechanism and at what price they're gonna buy.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share losses," said Marek this week to the iHNed.cz website.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is more important that the Congress decides this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The importance of the spirit is to have an agreement on the approval of the plan, the most important thing at this moment," Mr Marek stressed.
Couple blade: MP3 players versus phones.
We help you choose
While almost all mobile devices can play MP3 files, you cannot call with no MP3 players.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for a person to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the needs of the owner of the future.
Probably hard to get a high-quality high-quality record player to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear in bacolite plates, but there is no objective reason for this quality.
However, if his shelves are full of art rocks, jazz or blues bacteria, he's probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. composite - simplified by MP3 music.
Here are also price and quality categories.
For some, it can be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is probably hard to accept a 20-quarter market earphone.
Two extremists that all have enough space.
There's a wide choice.
Life expectancy of elements
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just playing music, but also what most mobiles are not even randomly able to play.
None of these devices are as universal as the phone.
With the primary functions, you can also play music and video, you can record both, you have a better and worse camera, you can even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communications, he'll have a little computer in his pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
The number of functional phones still have disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often the display sends you to the charger.
And music play is one of the biggest energy thinners.
Less mobile devices are able to play music for more than 10 or 12 hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly greater performance.
That's why the cheap cell phones count that they won't play for you for more than a few hours.
In addition, if you have a phone here, get a charger to your workplace for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
There will be no such problem with MP3 players, even worse ones will have at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The next problem is when you download music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the equipment has a universal USB cap and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers wrestle without adapter with miniature cards used in mobile phones.
For players, some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Enough of the machine uploading from the computer with music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players themselves are already creating a music library that is set up in order on the basis of the evaluation of the user, the name of the artist, the album, the genre.
Some devices represent only fast structures like Windows Explorer, and some of them know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
The choice of the specific device should be particularly interested in the lifetime of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of output and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If music serves you primarily as a background and listens for a short time a day, for example, on the electric, any mobile that plays MP3 is suitable for you.
And any cell phone can actually do that.
You don't have to listen especially to what music formats you can play on your cell phone or play.
Each MP3 can handle it and the final majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most widespread, and in addition, the main majority of devices can cope with WMA format music.
AAC (form used by Apple and for iPods) occurs less.
Better mobile phones also allow online music, for example.
Enough to visit the appropriate sites of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service can already be a pressing argument for the purchase of musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is limited to slutty and generally only one summer radio camps.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this kind of sales of music (although on GSM, on the Internet or on wireless internet) will be governed by the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Any time he wants to listen to something, his cell phone scans in his pocket, while his forgotten MP3 plays at home he spins.
However, it also depends on whether he always wears earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost all the mobile but only a few MP3 players.
A lot of people are probably the most advantage of musical mobiles.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair walkman.
However, mostly you are restricted to the lack of traditional earphone output.
Phones most equipped from the best and technical point of view can reach up to 15 thousand crowns with traditional earphones with a diameter of 3,5 mm.
At the same time, the advantage of players is simple to manage.
The easiest way to handle the cheapest players (see our choice) is, in any case, not necessarily, that everyone can handle.
The minimum function, which is comparable to the previous standard tape tape or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no collapse in the form of an accidentally on-line mobile internet, nor in the case of a huge account following the transfer of data.
What device to select
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to changing memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also buy the right card for up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive people can do what they can with up to 8 GB's memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or Irish.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have a separate MP3 control button, and the comfort of the treatment is thus approaching the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for walkman-series, has the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same category of prices to four thousand kroons, but with a higher memory capacity (at least 16 GB) and a battery life (almost 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will be able to reach Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
Our mobile market in Czech is relatively developed and our service providers provide the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - the virtual service provider that forces classical service providers to reduce prices substantially.
Maybe it won't be long.
On Mobil.cz, we have often written that Czech service providers in Europe are one of the most expensive ones.
This was confirmed by the ČTÚ, which called for the price of texts in Czech Republic to be more expensive than the other countries of the Union.
After the last step of the European Commission, the regulation of roaming charges may lead to a contradiction - some customers from the Czech mobile service providers from abroad will be cheaper than domestic.
How can prices in Czech countries be so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking a genuine competition to fight.
This may sound contradictory because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile service providers are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competing.
This is often agreed with Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunication Office, who said a few times earlier that there was no place for another service provider in Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classical service provider has no more than enough chances with its own network (e.g. it is likely that it is already hard to find frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
The step forward of virtual service providers to the mobile market has resulted in a significant reduction in prices, followed by the classical service providers.
Meanwhile, even before entering the market of large fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, sounds like ours were heard.
However, such service providers have been proven to have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, we don't have to go too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the start of the virtual mobile service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to acquire more than 100 000 customers in a half years and to become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobilking, Penta is a financial group that is the owner of the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The benefits of virtual service providers are the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
For efficient operation, he needs much less customers than the traditional service provider.
There is no relatively high cost of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world usually appear as low cost - offer cheap calls and texts, which are often offset by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile from Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper texts than its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can be a pretty good move to a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking Service Provider - who they like to trust," says David Seiber, director of this virtual service provider Mobil Entertainment Company.
It's hard to tell if an idea like that in Poland could work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman of Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach based on a majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with regard to the supply of services."
In Czech, it's impossible to set the mobile providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in Czech Republic, it will not be the Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the conciliations in Czech Republic do not seem to be too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, the spokesperson of the Penta financial group, in his phone interview to Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it has been demonstrated that existing mobile providers in Czech Republic do not have a little kinship with this idea.
On the contrary, they are making every effort to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera group has not for some time secreted its interest in launching the virtual service provider, which will therefore want to take another step in order to become a real competitor in the field of the company customers.
"We are very interested in providing not only wireless, but also mobile telecommunication services for our customers.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman of the group.
Maybe it's better time now.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider may be lucky at the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by the walls of uninterrupted silence.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be located on the Czech market.
Unlike the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
We have not been invited by a single, complex and serious project in this area," said Mobil.cz of Vlastimil Sršeň, Telephonica 02 press departments.
The Czech market is also referring to the specific situation of the other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, the spokesperson of T-Mobile, expressly agrees with O2: "We have not yet signed up a single viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that could be further funded."
And added: "The T-Mobile network at the end of the year is unlikely to appear any virtual service provider.
At this moment, we should have a specific agreement on our desk so that we can think about it in the short term."
Vodafone's attention will be paid towards meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
That's what we think is the most cost-effective in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is a partner finding to build networks shared with the fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a hook with service providers
The process of mobile service providers would easily be understood and the entry of another service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a reduction in prices and thus a reduction in their profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When something important to the service providers are able to cooperate, they are also witnessed by the huzavones around the birth of the U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ was probably about the birth of the U-fon of the T-Mobile company.
Information on this is publicly available on the ČTÚ website.
But right now, the U-phone comes as a good reason why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been influenced by its fourth access to the mobile market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would support high requirements for the market and services."
However, in view of this attitude of mobile providers, it is quite amazing that the Czech regulatory authorities are in full interest.
In the meantime, it is not just about the ČTÚ's attitude, which, unfortunately, is not the right to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Economic Competition Office is entitled to this.
However, the Office is characteristic of the whole problem.
"The virtual service provider's step on the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider would be concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded since the offer of potential interested parties to traditional service providers was probably not sufficiently interesting," said Chlapua Kristián, the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office, in response to our question.
The representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the agency that should represent the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one can recover from his market situation is more than strange.
In particular, if Chalupa Kristián adds: "Inland, where virtual service providers usually work, we can observe that their steps to the market have contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the interests of the UOHS do not include pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on the reduction of prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking that there is a completely compelling coherence from the reaction of the three mobile providers.
The question is whether it's just a coincidence, it's almost self-evident.
As in the charge stations, the works of the entirely identical gas prices must be just coincidence and hard competition.
"The Office in this case did not reveal any signs of anti-competitive proceedings, so there is no reason to interfere in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. market facts, in proportion to which they have no greater responsibility.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably missing by the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leader situation is one of the many debates.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on the only market in telecommunication from the perspective of economic competition.
Afterwards, of course, no Czech service provider is in the leading position.
However, some legal experts offer other views - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of the virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a particular segment, it is necessary to dominate.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, the UOHS should have a minimum incentive for three mobile providers to act similarly.
In the meantime, complaints by interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that there are very similar obstacles during the negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunication is a relatively normal trick that the UOHS is taking his hands off the whole case.
We've already met with that in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunication Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition could not be carried out in telecommunication, although many experts have hoped to improve the situation.
This is what the UOHS representatives need to know well, but probably others are in their interests.
It works when no one listens.
In the meantime, the operation of some virtual service providers remains undetectable, from which a number of Czech mobile networks already operate.
These are companies which issue their own mobile phone service price lists, but which are only partially public.
Because it's a multilevel marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemian Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected.
The magic is that the company operates as a classic company customer against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
Afterwards special price offers (and other discounts) will be received as a priority client.
The problem is that all Czech mobile providers' commercial conditions prohibit the like product.
"If there were cases that you were talking about, there would be a breach of contract terms that we would deal with and could lead to the completion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that news on such activities would not have reached the mobile service providers responsible.
In particular, for the three companies mentioned there may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service providers are defending against such a procedure.
They have no negligible profits from the activities of these companies, and, in particular, they do not threaten their official marketing, in addition to the real virtual service providers.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by the negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not on their names, so they cannot have it fully, as are the general customers of mobile providers."
But that's exactly what ČTÚ should be doing.
In addition, there is another question for the UOHS.
If mobile service providers fail to see the same procedure, why prevent the virtual service provider from being born?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively strong powers to detect such activities, and if you do not want it to be satisfied by explaining the providers that there is no such activity and that the commercial conditions are forbidden.
When we're not the most expensive
As already stated in the text a few times, the entry of virtual service providers to the mobile market has led to a noticeable price reduction in services.
In the meantime, in all countries where virtual service providers were created, classic service providers tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied markets, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, regulatory bodies were intervene at these moments, which did not in any way protect the interests of mobile providers but of their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual service provider was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators offer the whole case to each other.
Based on our experiences, we cannot get rid of the impression that unexplained competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is actually coming up soon, the Czech mobile market may be relaunching.
If one of the providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS can only remain difficult to intervene in rejecting other interested parties (discriminatory).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be calling more expensive.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Select the Best
Listen to the processing of four new versions of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, on the day of the Czech State, celebrated the new footage of the state anthem.
The hernust was recorded by the National Theatre band with Jiří Bělohlaki.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo songs, singer or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžinkova and Adam Plachetka sing.
Authors of Moenus change takekar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
The Czech Radio has already told the Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young reprehensive singers who are expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
"But from the beginning, both of them, and later on, I was trying to take care of the clean diction, the good understanding of the text and the harmony," he said.
The Czech state is celebrating its 175th anniversary for the next year.
The song “Where Is My Country? ” was first quiet in the Rendi Theatre in 1834, adding to the music of František Škroup in Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka.
It became popular, and people considered it spontaneously their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the separate Czech Republic, the seven state symbols remain one.
What's the "new" hymn?
On Wednesday, the Prague transport company also delivers a chip card.
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, the first passenger enters the metros, electric buses and buses with an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line.
The coupon is currently available for about 100 thousand who have Opencard chip cards.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time enter their chip cards in the Information Centres and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, M.Stec, Nadrazi Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can already be purchased from yesterday via the Transport Company website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over 400 customers for afternoon hours.
Those who start using online trade may infinitely forget the metro station sales windows where they had to run long lines so far.
The coupon can also be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers are available with a bar of trained servers that help interested people buy online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson of the project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in some front halls equipped with self-service machines.
How do these automobiles look?
They are red, reminded of the ticket managers, and the passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovicka, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska subway stations.
"Most there are five of them in town, but it should be eighteen by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon monitors automated instead of the driver
It's easy to handle automobiles that start tomorrow.
It's enough to just put in the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon leaves itself.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital tomorrow, but also in the area.
So on trains and bus lines around the city, between 300 and 499, with residents traveling mainly to the capital in Central Chechnya.
"On integrated transport trains classified in Prague, fishermen were provided with card readers to determine the validity of coupons," explained the control of the lines by the Ropid organisation compiling the roadmap for public transport in Prague.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are enclosed by the driver at the wallet.
Therefore, when driving in, the driver should not only show the chip card but also place the Opencard on the wallet side.
So the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is the easiest thing to ask the driver to do this," added Daniel.
Passengers who do not travel around the city with buses and will not remember when their coupon is running out, can go again to self-service automobiles that save their coupons.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device here.
The Sudates wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945 the Sudata Germans were asked to attach Šumava to the United States.
This is found in the letter in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the US patronate.
According to this wish, some groups of Sudan Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also found in a private archive, which is preserved today in the collection of the South Czech Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the re-entry of the "sumava county" to be returned to Czech Republic, which was yet taken by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly interpreted the situation, and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops will not be oppressors and enemies in the German regions, but will come as a liberator," it is in the letter, "Mans who bear the destiny of Šumava in their hearts."
Since the appending of the Czech Republic to the Germans of Sudae, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, can only give hope to brutality, dishonestness, non-consciousness, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate of Šumava now and forever.
"We can't believe that, regardless of four million residents' opinions, this area would be judged to us as a foreign country, which represses and upsets the minority, and would have nothing to do with the victory of allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is supposed to be fearing the vengeance of "clean oppressors."
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, it would be sufficient to hold a referendum in the Šumava county whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and to live during the patronisation of the United States.
Although the text of the letter, along with the current knowledge of postwar history, may seem a little naive, some historians say that the expectations of the Germans of the Sudan are correct.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least believe that they were being deported from the country, only a few of them recognized the possibility.
Some were expecting the United States and the Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudanes.
Others once again trusted that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, the Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German Navy during the war Budějovice.
When the British were captured at the end of the war and put him into prison camp in Holhtynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They were confident that when they came home, they could use the Czech language," said Chalupa.
According to German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one counted on the removal from the country based on Beneš decretions.
You're not thinking - you pay!
The emotional campaign attacks the leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history is the security of roads.
It would also be characterised by the media campaign affecting emotions, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Mr Aleš ?ebíček, the Minister's office of this campaign, hopes that he will scare the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The campaign to reach 150 million will be included in television, radio, cinema, internet, but it will also appear on publicity.
The drivers should be shaking away from speed and alcohol.
And you should remind them that their seatbelts will be chopped in before they start.
First of all, young leaders, motorcyclers, pedestrians, and not least the professional leaders want to be aware of their conscience.
And what's going on in the ads?
Emotionals, mostly human stories.
The whole campaign's "blood" slogan is witnessing this:
You're not thinking - you pay!
The term "not thinking" is written in the plate number with large letters.
And there's the word "pay" in the bloodbath.
This must symbolize a person's ability to pay for a moment of carelessness in his life.
The audiences are "scared" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in English countries where drastic images of the victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and dead on the Czech roads.
Advertisements were made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, let the drivers do it.
"For drivers, pull it, release it" system is valid.
For example, they go through the red, so they save time.
The risk of a penalty or an accident is 'take'.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, mainly the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks the driver's attention is less effective.
"If the warning board is fitted, it is likely that the environment is intervening soon and the leaders are not dealing with it," warned Kořan.
Olmert would give back almost all occupied areas in return for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the Israeli Government, spoke about the practical return of all areas in 1967, i.e. the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said that in an interview that was published on Monday by the Jediot Achronot daily.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means almost all of them, if we don't have to give back all (dispatched) areas," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we need to give Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli areas, because without this there will be no peace," he said.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Who wants security in Jerusalem and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through their feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, to give up a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to the attack of two July cities in which some people were killed and a few dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to "the Temple mountain, sacred and historic places" in the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to preserve Israel's sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It's not gonna work," he stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Surface
Olmert also expressed an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelites from the Golan-surface, which believes that it is an essential condition for the peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace-making with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they need to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (such as the movement); they must provide regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (síit movement), Al-Qaida and Jazhiad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Are passenger walkers illegal in the buses?
The law doesn't know them, you're not allowed to walk in a far bus.
Regarding the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company, the question was whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus near Padova.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the traveller's activities are contradictory to the transport law," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, a driver of a car crossing the bus, who ended with the death of a twenty-year-old passenger escort, probably caused it.
At that moment, she sat next to the driver at the least safe location of the bus, although there were two other places for her.
The bus can hit or suddenly brake at the moment the passenger accompanying coffee or newspaper.
There is a device for whether the bus has a seat under the traffic permit.
If it's not homologized in the bus, passengers have to sit.
Student Agency’s distance buses do not have standing positions, confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura, Actuálně.cz.
"We have tried to find a solution with this Ministry, and at first, passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have learned that passengers can go toilet on the road if they have their own seats," he stated.
The law doesn't know the passenger escort
"There is no clear legal abuse on the role of a passenger escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle accompanying person; it does not define his rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka’s spokesperson less clearly.
On the other hand, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Ministry of Transport Road Vehicle Management, considers that the law deals with the problem properly.
"Depends on whether the bus has its traffic permit.
And it's over," he says.
Buses may be discrimination in urban areas where they are standing and limited to the maximum speed and the maximum speed between the city and the permitted higher speed and distance seats and seats with the authorised maximum speed and seats with safety belts.
As on the plane, the expert tells me.
Jaroslav Hořín, the BESIP Transport Safety Expert, does not see any basic problem on board the bus when travelling by passengers.
"There are not many threats during continuous progress, the situation can be compared to services on an aeroplane.
I'm not sure when there's turbulence and a passenger can beat his head."
"But if the bus suddenly brake, of course, his physical laws are valid.
Same as city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be solved by the carrier by internal rules," she says and also believes that the problem has not been resolved in terms of the law.
Jančura is ready to eliminate services
Student Agency offers passenger services as a single bus driver.
He's employing 200 passengers.
The Director doesn't consider their occupation to be risky after the accident.
" However, as I have the impression that the occupation of passengers is risky, I will also cease.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on board.
That would be cost savings," he says.
In its vehicles, the lack of passengers was justified by safety interests, Alexej Litvin, the Director of Asiana, who operates the fracture of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have passengers, we're against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some kind of fatal injury," he said only a year ago to Týden.cz.
An Incredible Tragedy
The young passenger escort Plzeňi, who worked for two years, died during the Napoly route.
Without the use of the direction indicator, Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stopban and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to get out with manoeuvres, but the front part of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved places for the rest of the passengers were sold is rejected by Jančura.
"These places can't be occupied in distance flights, blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By compensating the girl's family, the agency expects not to judge the court, but also to expect financial compensation for the sinner.
Amendment of the law?
In the Far Future
Clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be a legislative amendment, which has been working for more than a year by the 30th expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But the group has not achieved any concrete results.
The buses aren't so much, the score system deals with maximum permitted speed and mobile use during driving," says Hořín's expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not keep the activities of passengers that would essentially threaten the safety of passengers," concludes Hanzelka’s spokesperson saying that the safety of buses belongs to police and labour offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf in Frankfurt
The letter of the WestLB Board to the bank's colleagues is not limited in large words.
The merger of Düsseldorf financial institutions and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt would be the "Central Capital Market Organisation of the savings finance group" – it is published on Monday.
WestLB would take a long-term profitable "competitiveness block" into a business like this.
Such a relationship could give a decisive push to further concentrations in the province banking sector.
This is a reading when a board wishes to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
In this regard, there is still considerable pressure on the uncertain WestLB bank.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Service Supervisor, who recently informed the North Rhine-Westfalen Government to limit the time limit for finding a lasting solution.
However, for savings money customers, Deka-Bank and WestLB are famous for their investment funds for a long time the subject of a kind of relationship - frankfurt.
Franz Waas, head of the Deka-Bank, informed in the mid-term presentation that the bank on Mainzer Landstraß and a province bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, do not understand the meaning of the merger.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which represents one half of the Land Banks and the other half of the savings funds associations, instructed the Board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this context, capital market transactions or certain parts thereof may be addressed.
However, the negotiations - claiming financial circles - have just begun.
Deka-Bank’s name among the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt is not the first to be identified in the consolidation of the savings sector.
For a moment in 2003, the Deka-Bank seemed to join the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this three alliance has become nothing.
The plans, the Hesseni province government, have barely been made public against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Stuttgarti Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and province banks has been re-entered again and again.
However, last time, Mr Merl, the Helaba Executive Director, spoke against the plans of mergers with the bank.
In spite of this, it is understood that there is a need to approach the various banks of the plot sector.
Now, after the province elections in Bavaria, the relationship between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected first.
It's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on further fusions is increased, potential partners may be exhausted slowly.
In southern Germany, only a younger business partner would have been able to experience the financial crisis significantly better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüring, a 85% business player in Helaba.
NordLB's better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank are suitable for each other.
In June Merl announced that the German savings fund and the SWC had not yet answered the final question of the business model to ensure the future of the province banks.
Finally, the WestLB could be demolished, but they do not want it to be.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors in there also states that they are definitely seeking a "full solution".
How this can be coordinated with the merger of individual units with Deka-Ban is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Ios weekend"
This is Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena's here as his girlfriend, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Behind them, Kaiser's brand of five-letter barrel is a strong-leathered beard man, stating to about 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest, how deep he can chew up his throat.
Elena first finds Luca's face, then kisss her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus next to Puorta Nuova railway station leaves four buses at 23.45 a.m. "destinazione Monaco, paint dellaround" for a trip, expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly held up to the Italians, only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already started to sing alongside their flag, and during the night they started celebration.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians - says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, with long, hairy coats and wide, silver-shaped glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. He only arranged three trips this year.
Night there, during the day at Oktoberfest, home at 22.30.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, including a German course of greeting Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German tourism in Marco Frankfurt in accordance with the Bajor Beer Cleaning Act.
And the buses are already getting into the night on the motorway towards "Brennero."
No beer, not yet.
The bus is slowing down, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, that's it. They'll need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses are still taking a short break in front of Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week according to the plan, there are now nearly 50 other buses coming from Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has one last briefing, presenting the military plan.
First, everybody wear the yellow hat.
On the left side, the text "Oktoberfest" written in the frakturi letters is read, alongside Marco's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the beer doors open, run," Marco shouts in the morning.
"Fold!" Run and take places in the back of the tent.
"Not ahead, because we're stuck, and not all yellow hats sit on the same benches, but scatter in the tent."
The one-literous corsoe costs 8.25 euros, yelling Marco.
And don't forget about the tip.
"Let the security guards know that you're being good.
As you leave your seats, they'll be occupied."
Thirdly, "I want you to be here at the point of 6:30 tonight." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one man as a roadmark ties yellow caps to trees, boards, and even one of the great Bajoran folk's electoral posters.
Prepare to retreat.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as "Iolas weekend".
There are no precise figures; there are 50 thousand people who cross the Alpocons in their beer pads, supposedly 10 percent of all the visitors of the weekend are coming from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven south-tirol police officers, and Italian volunteers are assisting the Bavarian Red Cross, whose national statistics include about 200 medical cares for the Italians, preventing the Austrians (approximately 80) and the brits in the bottom of the drum (approximately 60).
The Italians especially liked Hofbräu beer.
Unwanted nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasised by the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is also a good thing that the politician used the word "proportionately" and said, to what it was, that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that's what happened this weekend.
Daxon registered Hypo Real Estate (HRE) received a billionaire loan from the German bank consortium to protect itself against market turbulences.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan support would be €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate pays interest only after the amount used.
The money is partly from private, partly public banks.
In the background, the subsidiaries of Depfa are lost.
According to the news, Depfa, which financed public finances, borrowed money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for a very short period of time, which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in markets.
During the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve decreased by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and its equity ratio decreased moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
The current revenues and the net revenues from the cash transactions returned to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, from credits to claims and certain securities, and from the liquidation of the credit business’s reserves, revenues fell to EUR 5 million by more than 70 %.
Only the higher revenue from the reimbursement of the ex-ante accounting costs of the Depfa group transformation, as well as the reimbursement of interest rates and the transactions made to the companies involved in the scheme, resulted in a relatively moderate 16% income deficit.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state financer speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently separated from the Aeral Bank.
Due to the lack of classic public funding, Depfa made it more strongly involved in the infrastructure projects and in the joint projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
On the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now carry out descriptions that have a "real impact" on the group's performance indicator - reported quite generally.
Actually, there was no dividend payment.
The dividend has been reduced to the third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a significant state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depfa.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have client deposits.
By the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending of the banks between each other is absent, as the banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets every year to refinance part of Depfa's credit portfolio, approximately EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group's funding requirements are covered by the loan for a reasonable period of time and the company was protected from "the impact of largely inoperative international financial markets".
According to other sources, the refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, the HRE Executive Director, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the Hypo Real Estate Group's marketability is now guaranteed.
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and inefficiencies of the crisis, they can't be certain.
It is not even unprecedented that funding should not be fully mobilised.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the Saturday late evening news says the bank was still on the edge of the bank bankruptcy, even the temporary rescue couldn't reassure the moods.
The stock exchange rate fell to EUR 3.30 by 75 per cent.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite well maintained.
While the debts ranked in the first place are barely changing, the margins of the underlying bonds fell considerably.
The crisis concerns, in particular, the earlier subsidiaries, Württemberg Hypo bonds and, in a reasonable way, the past deadlines over the year 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously appeared to be a speculative alternative to investment, their sensitivity should now be dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the recovery of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution has taken the crisis almost to the house by receiving Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the deferral of the benefits may be based on a deadline.
Or what happens now is almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, the reports on partial nationalisation have shown that certainty has now become a mere rightful hope.
For long-term creditors, the decision to resign from their investment can cause unwanted nights.
However, short-term investors may use sales to provide reserves for taxes to be paid after the profits of the coming years.
The secrets of Sylvana and the benose box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself to the Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls start to wander: The German girl is full of "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about the mangates - in the new exchange students-blog, he's talking about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was already on my way to the school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavatech, and I travel 40 minutes on the train of Tachibana Highscholig.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I wasn't mistaken.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start eating from eight hours until a short conversation with the teacher begins at 8 p.m., the home room.
But before the teaching started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who's happy to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old skirt of my roommate, adding blouse, blue knees and black shoes.
So I was standing in this dress before the cathedral, and I tried to say everything right: "Syjonara, vo not Sylvana..." - they call me Sylvan, I came from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispering, whispering and whispering, and I've always heard the word "plan."
I've known that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic treasure of Japanese girls, and it means " cute, sweet."
And then I went to my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me was smiling widely, and it was an honor to have been placed next to the exchanges.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the bell was talking, they were normally rushed.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and with questions, they drove a hole in my stomach - and it's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
After the break, everyone packed out his benzo.
My guest viewer made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German sandwiches for ten hours.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, sugar and algae salads, fruits and some kind of tofu meat.
Mostly, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
The foods look weird, and they taste completely new.
Actually, everything's very good.
Yeah, well, maybe except for the salted silk paste, brrrr.
In Japanese schools, beno isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with her own hand made beno, which she compiles especially artistically, in the hope of getting to know the boy at lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this here.
"Why is Japan?" - they asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because you're just charming."
After all, I've been reading the monks for years.
And to understand more the comic books and cultures in them, I started learning Japanese sometime.
It was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're in great respect here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, strict, disciplinary and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats have emotions.
A rat or a moth is running away in the event of danger.
Joseph LeDoux's neurolog is convinced: animals have feelings.
But how is it possible to examine whether they feel the same when they act like us?
In the "Edge" Internet magazine, famous scientists have published their articles for years.
The SPIEGEL ONLINE is in one of the "What Does It Be Real Without Being Proved"?
I believe that the animals have emotions and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else able to prove it so far, and it is true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is identical.
However, as we examine other species and, in general, scan the questions of sensation or consciousness, we arrive at a difficultly accessible field, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, run or attack.
People act in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experiences by some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animals.
Human consciousness-related circuits, on the one hand, contain almost always the side of the prefrontal brain (due to the short-term memory and the role of implementation/management functions).
This broad area is more advanced for man than for other mammals, and it appears to be completely missing for other living creatures.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, for example, to know who we are or if we are planning and decision-making, it is reasonably assumed that man is even different from other mammals.
Another dramatic feature lies in man’s linguistic nature: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often claimed that the consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it were not dependent on the language, the language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to be very different from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may be for the other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of the special hardware, it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experiences, its research will put us to serious problems.
Most of my explanations relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be easily accessible to science.
The information processes of the animals, regardless of their contents, could be examined, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments for the short-term memory of the main mammals, in particular in the example of visualisation.
However, in the presumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have examined, they rely on the neural relationships of consciousness rather than on the Cauzal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also highlights the importance of the prefrontal brain kernel in the creation of visualisation.
What is the result of these emotions?
I'm going to lead this back to an emotional system, like fear, being activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the localised protection system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) involves a work memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain kernel that are characteristic of the main mammals and especially of man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, sensation is delicious, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorize the conditions to describe them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities of the brain cord and the body sensational areas of the brain, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stain.
Since this network has not changed very much in the process of human evolution, it can easily play a part in overall emotions.
I can't totally deny that, but I don't think it's proven.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be a fear for rats and people is likely to be the same: How can rats and people feel when they act similarly?
A cockroach is running away in the event of danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience.
Although the neural coronation continues to help: rats and people have similar brain strains, while the colones have no brains.
But the brain's responsible for emotions?
And even if that were proven to be for humans: how can we prove that for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And since their emotions are likely to vary fundamentally from our own (which is based on the specific circuits and languages of human consciousness), rather than searching for the emotional behaviour of rats than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is carried out at the neural level if we measure the same level in rats and humans.
As for rats, I don't search the language and the consciousness, neither the emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem to be a short-looking attitude, but I'd rather go ahead than hitting a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Temple Time for Poland and Ukraine
Vice-President of Ukrainian Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik announced that the preparations would shortly be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence and proof of Ukraine in its decision of UEFA Bordeaux to believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship with Poland", said Vaszjunik.
"This, however, does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work just started, and there's a lot more to do in both countries."
As regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are missing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
"We have to work with a twist now" said Grigorij Szurkis, President of the Ukrainian football alliance.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
In Poland, they were meant to take even more radical steps.
After many scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, replaced by the independent Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was convened at the initiative of the Minister for Sport, Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP news agency, "the danger that the PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules.
"We assured Michel Platini, the President of UEFA that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
Only in the past season had to be ranked in the lower class because of the first league teams, and eventually the league was to be postponed.
The rageous Dennis Quaid cuts back
The actress wanted to advertise a new movie, he was talking about his personal life in the interview, and now he had a problem with his ex-husband.
♪ Whoever's shoes ♪ ♪ And cut back ♪
The war of roses has been late at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-married couple: The two Dutch actors for seven years after their divorce fights ugly before the public.
And Ryan, in the interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, first said about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, causing many pain."
And after the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him.
The press work related to Ryan's new film "The Women" took place in the spiritual striptery, telling us the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the call of an unfaithful husband, "Smarming", said 54-year-old actor to the New York Daily News, "that Meg repeats and spends the history of our relationship."
And it's also "pityful" that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are repeatedly "remembered with many pains and changes that the divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan's been alone since his divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, the answer is the following side cut: "My life continues anyway.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is fine."
Prices for airline tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first semester of 2008, European flights and accommodations were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, in Germany, flights have become less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airlines and hotel rooms have become more favourable again - so the results of one of the studies of American Express travel and financial service providers are summarised.
The company analysed the first semester booking data for 2008 and established a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the accommodations have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices increased by 6.9 per cent from 48 European cities examined in 41 compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year during the period from April to June.
This trend was clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where the guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the dollar at a low price, which led to "the U.S. tourists" for a slow journey.
The reduction of hotel room prices affects financial centres, such as Frankfurt or London, rather than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, a 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
As regards the prices of flight tickets, there was also a growing change in the first quarter.
Due to the price of kerosin, passengers had to pay 7.1 percent more on average in the tourist class than in 2007, while long-term airlines with high fuel demand costed 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist tickets decreased by an average of 12,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but prices in business and first grades have shown only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11,9 per cent and decreased by 23,6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased to half.
The reason for the price reduction is, on the one hand, in a moderate economic growth - the company claims.
demand was weakened in many segments of the airways market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe strengthens the pressure of competition.
The tense situation proves that the airlines cancel their lost flights and several airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
He's beating Gladbacho to HSV 1:0
A goal and simple methods were taken to the edge of the table in Hamburger SV.
With Borussia, Luhukay is still not able to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein Enlargement Deep Flight for the National Selected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player was only in the game late and the lift went back from the gate.
His exact message left his lips in a convincing way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal" - swinged Hermann Rieger in the hallway leading to the Arena of Hamburg.
There's not much going on in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat in their place again.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a greater authority than some of the players.
So his request was found to be heard at the competent location.
Coach Cornelius Jol was stabbing and consensusing his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach, Martin Jol.
His orders could have said similarly: Here with the second goal!
The command's gone.
"Today it wasn't always nice to see" - acknowledged later by Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt's "slower imagination."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) Golosing results are due to the head of Mladen Petric (11.); and to the circumstances that the very weak gladbachs could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a tall victory," he put Martin Jol together.
Hamburger SV will now be 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers have already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which has presented their team as the first of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to do this," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the intermediate certificate of the tabella is more predictable than HSV dominance.
Although the team finds itself slowly because of its late-fashioned contracts - the name and Silva of Brazil, Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern, the gate, but is not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and more conduct" - demanded Jol.
After the vote
The Wall Street is in the way of fear.
Due to the first news of failing the rescue package, Dow Jones dropped temporarily 700 points.
That was the biggest loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow was somewhat stronger.
At 20:30 the world’s most important stock exchange barometer was good at 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
The technology dealer Nasdaq fell to 1548 points by more than seven percent minus.
The biggest loser of Dow at this moment was American Express with 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America by 12 percent.
None of the papers have been reinforced.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank fell by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought a share of the bank as a large investor.
As part of the rescue operation, resources are intended to be available for the purchase of so-called two mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not paid at the same time but gradually.
In fact, the State would receive the shares options of the financial institutions, which would be eligible for an adjustment in the event of an appropriate trend in exchange rates, thereby reducing the liability of the State Bank.
European and American and stock exchanges
Assistance from billions to European and American banks does not dissolve investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate is falling in the German big bank's stock price and is stuck with Dax.
The American Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the rescue planned by the state of the financial market.
The spectacular loss of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank's spectacular exchange rates deepened the German share index (Dax).
The value of the shares in the real estate financer in Munich fell to the quarter despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank was weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax has fallen under 6000 points of vital soulological importance and has noted 5839 points with 3.7 percent minus.
The stock markets have been forced to kneel around the world.
Wall Street opened up in New York with a significant loss.
The investors fear that the US government's 700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3 percent down to 10.809.25 points.
The American Parliament has voted on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote can take place on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges were known only one direction: in London, the FTS indicator showed 3.2% weakness, lost 2.9% in 40 Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743,61 points after the initial increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped back to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator was 506.43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.59.5.75.
On the Mdax Stock Exchange, Arcandor's shares were weakened following the notification of capital increase.
The private bank of Sal. Oppenheimer registered 23 million new shares.
The Trade and Tourism Association also announced that Thomas Cook did not sell the shares.
Dark material affects the flight of space conditions
A mysterious phenomenon has been discomfort among researchers for years. Dark material affects the speed of space zones during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory cannot be fully corrected.
The "Ulysses" astronaut flew in space for almost 18 years.
The soon freezing fuel pipelines threaten the ice cream.
In scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomaly, has caused a mess.
Swing-by means the gravity of space zones in which an sky body, such as the Earth's gravitational terrain, is obtained with additional boost.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like Ulysses, also used this physical trick.
However, it has been amazed by researchers for years: flight objects do not act fully as they are expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, abnormalities occur at the speed.
The probes are suddenly speeding up or slowing down.
The physicists have never found any explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as an anomaly by swing.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory may not be fully correct, which will absorb the mass of the material as a curve of the space.
Stephen Adler, a physicist of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the anomaly of swing-by by the so-called dark material found by the spacecrafts in the universe.
"For the anomaly, the dark material may be responsible, which may even be found near the Earth," says Adler.
World space scientists only learned about the existence of the dark material ten years ago.
Obviously it develops a gravitational force that can be observed by the effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the substance itself is not completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, particularly visible light is not released or beat back.
According to scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is made of dark material.
The tourists abducted in Egypt have been released
After ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists in Egypt were once again free - confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros of ransom.
In a shooting before hostage release, six hostages allegedly lost their lives.
In South Egypt, five German citizens were abducted.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Germans are becoming the target of the kidnappers again and again.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This was reported consistently by the Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media.
According to Italian TV broadcasters Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We are currently investigating their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizens, and eight Egyptian accompanyors are safe and sound - reported in the Egyptian state television.
19 participants of the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The causes of the shooting before the release of hostages continue to be blurred: According to a Egyptian security officer, hostages have already shown willingness to release hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed them.
"The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the officer.
"It's just about taking the hostages over the trial," when suddenly "the surprise happened."
On Sunday, Sudanian soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two arrested.
The hostages demanded six million euros of ransom fees from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one hostage.
The "al-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German intermediary, reported that the release of hostages is withdrawn because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages are released after payment of the ransom.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo was not willing to take a position on the report.
"Assassination" led to the rape of stepfathers
At the court, she said that a woman had committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise spent six years in prison in the Stithians county of Cornwall, 57 years of age, after she made a confession of attempted eight-or-mortal sexual admission.
The Truroi Criminal Court found out that he regularly committed Stephanie Randle between five and seven years of age.
He wrote in one of Trerise's statements, "I feel like I'm responsible for his death."
During the trial, Randle was committed to suicide at the home of Plymouth, Mutley, at the age of 34, on 1 April 2007.
When he lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise tied him up and tied his eyes in front of the intercourse while his mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise resigned from his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwall as his place of residence.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing, Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust Arts Protection Organisation, was persecuted by the horror of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, the Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to love surfing and biking, said "sensitive dead" and "written about life".
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was confronted with her stepfather, who ended up in a letter, saying, "I've always tied her eyes and tied her up.
I wasn't sexually upset.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are extremely strange fetisist, and I'm sure this was terrible for your victim, especially if it was only seven years old.
This uncomfortable family novel ended up with the victim committing suicide.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if it weren't, the case might never have been courted."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact that Stephanie's parents think of your crime on your daughter over the years.
If this had not been done, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the important data was charged
According to the BBC's information, they're accusing the government official who's uncovered highly classified documents on a train in June.
The man was expelled from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the most prosecution of violations of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional crime.
Frank Gardner, the reporter from the BBC Department of Defence, said that the step was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal case," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed has been charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Law, which is about keeping the information.
The State Prosecutor suggested that the charges against the Officer are represented by the Metropolitan Police by the man due to his highly sensitive work on the United Intelligence Commission.
His lost documents included secret surveys on the capabilities of Al-Qaida and the Iraqi army.
On Monday, he was informed of the decision and then moved to an unknown place from his home.
Housebuilding cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
British housing cooperatives may account for an account exceeding GBP 80 million after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits deposited by Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, the President of the Housebuilding Association (BSA) says "revenge" that companies and members must pay.
The loan of 14 billion is finally recovered after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, during the period, the accumulating interest rate is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Disease System has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been prudently prudently practised now have to pay the accounts of the institutions that were considerably less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We found that each company has to pay the proportion of the deposit amount he owns. The companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must put 81 million pounds aside to pay the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, head of the union of dwelling companies, told BBC that the measure was considered unfair.
"It is disgusting that those institutions have to pay the accounts of the institutions which have been careful at the time of the recovery of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from a large amount of bill," added Cole.
The interest rate due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of that year.
In 2010, a full-year interest will be paid, which may be twice the current.
Since housing cooperatives are self-aiding organisations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the account either on higher fees or on the basis of lower interest received after their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five cents per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced that it would increase the wholesale price of milk by five pences from Monday to Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-Pennial increases in February and after an analysis carried out by a consultant company.
The resellers themselves decide whether or not to move further on price increases to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey changed last in 2002.
They rejected Bangladesh's previous Parliamentary representative's request to be free of charge.
The Bangladesh Court has rejected the request of the former MEP, Sheikh Hasina, which means they may be arrested when they return to the country.
His attorney told him that the court refused to defend him freely against the accusation that, during the time of the parliamentary representation, he blackmailed 50 million bucks from a businessman (729.700 dollars).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the provisional government of the country, supported by the army, give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although it was conditionally released to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of free-footing that it can preserve its freedom when it comes back to the country.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
"The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail that it was not necessary, as it has already been temporarily placed on free foot and involved in foreign treatment," we knew Rafique from Huq's lawyer.
"We will increase against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers' arguments, he needs to be able to defend himself on liberty so that he can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
One of the leaders of the Awami League Party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
Last year, the temporary government supported by the army took over the power, but in June, they let him out of prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Problems in the Afghanistan Anti-Polio vaccination programme
According to the UN, nearly 200 000 Afghanistan children were left out of the recently organized polio vaccination programme for violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the UN was organising a six-dimensional vaccination operation.
However, they said that for safety reasons, they could not reach the children living in certain parts of Helmand and Kandahar on the south.
According to a United Nations speaker, all this happened despite the promise made by the Talibans: they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of employees who were taking vaccination.
BSkyB's appeal with regard to ITV was rejected
BskyB's appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee was rejected, which ordered it to reduce its interest in the rival television tax in the ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7,5%.
The Committee previously concluded that BSkyB's share is hindered by competition and that it has an unfair influence on the company over the ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL from buying the ITV, which has been renamed to Virgin Media since then.
In April 2007, the Competition Office announced that BSkyB’s share purchased from ITV jeopardises the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and oversight of Ofcom, all opposed the purchase.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in the share of ITV would be unreasonable and disproportionate, in particular in view of the fact that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation of the U.S. prosecutors' case
The U.S. chief state attorney appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine U.S. state attorneys in 2006.
The step followed that the report by the Chief Inspector of the Court of Justice criticised the decisions of the government officials.
The report judged the White House officials, the law enforcement officers and the former chief state attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that the state attorneys were lost from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, Special Attorney will now examine whether the officers who were hearing the investigation tried to prevent justice from lying.
"The serious charges on possible crime have not yet been investigated, and have not been cleared" said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to commit witnesses.
The series began by removing nine state attorneys from the office of the US Justice wallet in December 2006.
At the time, they said the state attorneys were dismissed because of their weak performance.
However, later it was found that the deceased state attorneys received nothing worse than many of their other colleagues, which led to the conclusion that political consideration has been taken behind the dismissals.
Some state attorneys participated in the criminal proceedings of high-level Republican Congress members, while others were not willing to take part in examining the accusations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are conducting an investigation from the government's orders and conducting court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but they can't be removed from their position for political reasons.
The director of the court wallet, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the main state attorney's attacks due to the loss, and finally resigned.
A number of other officials of the Judicial wallet also gave up their resignation.
In his report, Gonzales greatly criticised his role in the case. He believes that the main state attorney is responsible for "primary responsibility" for dismissal, the "declared" control role and "excellently withdraws" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, criticize the former assistant of the older Bush, have failed to cooperate in the investigation.
Meat Loaf is recognised as eposa
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for the epic anthem of "Bat Out Of Hell" on the Q Awards Awards Gale.
The singer who takes over his special golden award next week at the London ceremony said that he was honored.
The nine minutes, fifty seconds long song Meat Loaf, 1977, was a title song for the album of a public garden.
Coldplay received most of the nominations for this year's awards, four categories of candidates.
Paul Rees, the editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and this is "Bat Out Of Hell."
The song made by Jim Steinman needed a very loud voice, and that sound was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with an almost two-minute instrumental break.
He appeared as a small record in 1979, and on the slager lists it reached 15th place.
However, the album of Meat Loaf "Bat Out Of Hell" was present for almost nine years on the slager lists and then sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently had health problems. Among other things, in 2003, he had surgery after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to intense genital inflammation.
Later, it turned out to be a cistal on his tone.
Unknown city street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, roads and other roads. Some of them are just performing practical functions.
However, many trained cab drivers and long-have residents here could hardly tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and is heading north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
No street boards.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
But the street has admirers.
It's there, for example, the Avalon Bay, the building of the luxurious first street buildings recently built.
He wants to cover up the Extra Place again, and he wants to ensure that the new buildings' stores and butics can be reached a clearer way.
One of the admirers of the street is the neighbors who have lived here long ago, who have been captured in the snake street, that this was the only remains of the past before the renovations of the neighborhood.
However, the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city is not in the interest of it.
In this month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee of the district municipality, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee prefers that the street remain in the city's management and asks for a new plan for the next month, reported by Susan Stetzer, Head of the 3rd Municipal Body.
"There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to remain in town," he said.
"The proposals for the renovation and management of Avalon can be made, but we also want to guarantee that it will remain available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to recover the small street and he wants to have seats.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, told me that although the company wants to use the street, he doesn't insist on his possession.
"The main point of Avalon Bay is to rebuild this sliced alley and transform it into a pleasant public helly", he said, adding that the city proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, the spokesperson of the building office, told us that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was the task of developing buildings and not managing the buildings.
Compared to his colorier neighbor Bowery, Extra Place has not much historical significance.
Some say he received the name "the land of anyone" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large property was divided among his many children, and no one demanded the narrow landscape.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back entrance of the CBGB was open to the Extra Place, and the street may be the most ridiculous picture of the album Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"Remek was a scene", said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothing fossils, barrels and poster pieces, as well as wooden leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they own East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, claiming that this piece of public property, as modest as it is, should be held by the community.
Others mention Extra Place as a rare one, a part of the city that is practically unchanged and must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, a journalist named "The New York of the disappearing Jeremies" (The Book of Letters: a bitter nostalgia of the extinction process of the city), added a part of the story about the Extra Place, published in the title "The New Yorker" of the weekly newspaper "Varos" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is even dark during the day, which is bound by rust doors, iron warehouses and sparkling windows, and where the wind wears seven newspapers in the channels."
The street, except for some exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to the higher price-bedded clothing store.
There was a graffiti on the walls, and a empty, 0.75 litre beer bottle was lying next to a dumped, fresh paperwork.
Some patrol officers told us that we rarely think of Extra Place, but they think we could use the renovation.
Fields said that some people underestimated the attractiveness of the street in the current state.
"I spent the most beautiful years in dark, rude and disgusting places", he said.
Discussion on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi are debating the opinion of candidates on two-language education in this section.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher and head of education research in the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, is "It is not as good as you think: Why does he need a school choice" book.
It is not easy for voters in Spanish.
Brack Obama's proposals for education are also included.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish lip students obtain a degree significantly less likely than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama's educational plan expressly supports, inter alia, "transitional double-language education" for students in English.
At the same time, Obama is concerned that the commitment to two-language education, which focuses on school education in non-English, is being overlooked in its interest in combating major performance gaps.
Consider, for example, a contracted school of Sixth Street Prep in the eastern Los Angeles county.
Most of the students of the school are Spanish lips and low income.
More than one third of the students recently arrived learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics study.
Similar impressively, 93% of the fourth graders performed excellently in English and literary exams.
This incredible performance was not achieved by means of which Obama would benefit.
Sixth Street focuses on repeating, practicing, continuous evaluation of skills and rejecting objections.
Moreover, this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school education principle is the "full intake" of students studying English in the language environment.
The method of baptism is almost exclusive use of English when teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposed the two-language education, said, "We've made an extreme success in walking into a classroom, not knowing who the student came from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It's working," he said, "We're working."
Would Obama, as an example to follow, claim schools like Sixth Street Prep to other major Spanish lips and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long been supporting bilingual education), and since they are consistently in favour of two-language education, we cannot be sure of the reaction of Obama.
Although you agree that immigrants have to learn English, Obama recently gave an appreciative statement on the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "circumstance of English".
Instead, he said, "they should be able to get their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them into nothing.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to the renewed concerns of the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply because of concerns that the rescue plan for the financial markets in America will not be able to stimulate the economy.
The papers of the crude oil have fallen back to $99.80 in the New York Trade Exchange this morning.
Prices decreased by over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchanges have been squeezed by the financial mess in Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached EUR 145.29 per barrel in July, almost USD 90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before the immense uncertainty of the financial markets was again undermined.
On Monday, the concern reinstated investors even after the heads of the Congress announced: they agreed on the economic rescue mission, which has been the largest in history.
The concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time have shaded to the news.
Citigroup will buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly state the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of despaired weekend conciliations, it seems that the rescue operation has failed to stimulate the POT.
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also be reduced.
"The future of the market for stock shares, interest rates and exchange rates worldwide has become uncertain", wrote Deutsche Bank an analyst for investors.
"We don't think the commodity market will be avoided by the epidemic."
The biggest question for the stock exchange is the extent to which the United States' disease is contaminating the whole world, especially China."
As due to the slowdown of economic growth, oil consumption decreased, banks' analysts declined from their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the second-quarter Bravo, the team set up a record.
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, the Defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched his second quarter opening on Sunday when Jets changed the sensational pool of a pointless game.
"I've never seen this before," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and Arizona Cardinals' ballistic games were fully in line with dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown patch. This is the perfect way for a afternoon that has evolved considerably.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown pastes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't feel sorry for the trouble," said Favre about all the passes given to Coles.
He's a hell of a player.
We've been able to communicate well so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' controller Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, in the cornerback position, caught a bad drop and threw back 32 yards of touchdown.
Eric Smith, the security player, got into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker pulled the ball out of Warner's hand.
This could have been the last turn of the most amazing mosaic in the match.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 results.
This was the best result that the Jets had achieved in a quarter.
When they asked for the Jets coach, Eric Mangini to describe the stunning nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both of them - in the third quarter, Cardinals got 21 points that Jets didn't get one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The resting Gebrselassie will break his own world record.
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people considered the best medium and long-distance runner in Berlin, when he broke his own world record on Sunday, and he became the first one to run 42.2 kilometres in 2 hours 4 minutes.
During the comfortably flat track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds during 2:03:59 in his previous result of 2:04:26 in Berlin last year.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie’s 26th world record was set up in so many areas that he received world championships in almost every season from 1500 meters to marathon or reached a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped off the peking Olympic marathon, which, in view of this, may have proven to be too careful - that air pollution would further exacerbate the astmatic problems.
Instead, he signed up for the Berlin Marathon.
Almost in perfect circumstances - in days, at beginning at 9 °C and at the end of 13 °C - won Gebrselassie on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds of speed.
Since the Marathon record has not started on the Marathon, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Tergat, Kenya, has turned to longer distances, the marathon record has declined for more than two minutes in the last decade since the results of Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 were 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had a seizure and couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, it's fresh under the forced rest and it's not rusted.
"I'm so glad", Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything went well."
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, the Eastern African rival in Ethiopia - that he uses too many tools in his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, leaves on his iram runners as if he runs on the track and puts world records in front of the competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces the greatness of Gebrselassie in the long-distance run.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie, with four Kenya's Iramruns involved, reached the point of command under 1:02:04.
Two leading Kenya runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the iramfuckers got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 miles before the target, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who secondly targeted 2:05:36, 5 minutes to improve his individual best.
Interesthi came in thirdly under 2:07:48.
In the female competition, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest win, 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
During the past spring, Mikitenko, 36 years of age, won the Marathon of London with the results 2:24:14.
Because of the alleged back injury in the Peking Olympics, he could not participate, but he quickly recovered and won the marathon in Berlin, where he had improved his individual peak for five minutes.
He won the competition with smart counting: he first allowed the Ethiopias and Kenyas a group of four people to go ahead and gain significant leadership, then about 30 km after they ran.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa targeted the second time at 2:21.31, while the Kenyas Helena Kiprop became third with the result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and the Trials of the Black
In the experience park in Greater Orloto - a few miles from everything that shines, loud and huge - hides in a quiet small town where the pride and difficulties of the African American experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black town that was integrated into the country, which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is now not as simple as it described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guaya and two school towns without prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora Festival every year.
However, in many respects, the city described and made tourist attraction - which is included in the Florida guidebook issued by the Federal Writers of the Criminal Period, separately from the environment.
As independent, dignified and sealing as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that the city black people in Florida were often not willing to share their true thoughts with white people who "as little as they know about us, they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the Black Chairman Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of ideas on the race issue, many people are unconfidential to the sights of the outsiders.
"We are very careful about how we tell our story," reported the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and was a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say the right thing."
Eatonville has been characterized for a long time with the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historically important model for black people to stand up, while a community of almost 2400 people with poverty indicators reaching the national average double.
Partly literal nodes, partly as a result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes glorified, southern, urban, black culture flourishing in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are proud and defending at the same time.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is how everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in a sincere, strong dialekt - such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) - introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida travel book have transformed the city, which is lying next to road 17, leading from the formerly forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, even the drummer, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We'll find the modern public school right from the road, on a brown basis with white shear, with careful courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller carries, although he can hardly write and read."
He mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "is selling all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodations."
Thus, some hundreds of oral Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with autonomy, but at the same time with the inconsciousness of writing, remarry and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's travel book has introduced it differently.
Not everyone really liked this description.
"Zora said things like they were" - reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by referring them to the saliva songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "There were some people who didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as the eleven strangers who often visited us after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Franklin recalled that when Hurston was storming into the city, he was usually arrived in a bullying Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and long-pants in a city where people were still proud of their dignified clothing.
Most of the people were charming, said Franklin, but a lot of people were sniffing.
"The people always wanted to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the Sabelia lake terrace, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: "It never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books weren't released again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most parts of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an identifiable grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant memorials in Eatonville, or large, public readings.
"I don't think they've understood how rich the world or what he left us at all", said Valerie Boyd, the author of the Hurston Biography, published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The Orange County officials wanted to build a five-way path through the city instead of the two-way main street, the Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlandó has already entered the Interstate 4 motorways connected to the States on the west side of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has ended the relative idyllic isolation of the Community.
In the 1950s, wars on racial mixing have tasted hatred with the community.
"A bunch of white boys came over and threw seats on the edge of the road with naranx and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw out a greasy melon from a car."
In 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court for violent integration. So he said about the decision called "Brown v. Board of Education": "Well, he does not respect my species."
Today, the residents say that the decomposition of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the composition of the eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black kids used to kill them -- that's what I remember -- the man huged his teacher in the morning and night" -- said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, CEO of the non-profit organization called "We are guarding Meg Eatonville's community."
"This took until the students and teachers came from a common place" he said.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us", Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped to raise many other Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, actors and artists who have risen to prejudice, as he did, with so magnificent self-confidence and lines as follows: "How can anyone deprive himself of the enjoyment of my company!
That's incomprehensible for me."
In 1975, Alice Walker was sacrificing Hurston's insignificant grave, and he started fighting to return his reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway wrote a well-known Hurston biography that re-emphasized America's role models in the bookstore.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was back at the center of attention.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors considered him a savior.
In 1988, the community began to organize a Hurston festival to show you what would ruin the county with its main route.
Thousands of fans arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the ceremony every January since then.
A few years later, the county stopped proposing road construction.
"With the five-division of the main road, the community revived, connected to a full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
People outside the city appeared more and more than Rachelle Munson's lawyer, who started going to church in 1993, and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville entered the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new, single-level (naturally named from Hurston) library opened on the recovered and built Kennedy radiation.
Eatonville remains Florida's cocktail: it's not just 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like there's a outskirt during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Now 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take care of the outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville, to say something.
Most interviews require prior authorisation, and some things - such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and depicting blacks on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many - among other things, the self-confidential teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the vivid red - are afraid to misunderstand their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown increased.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: they were wonderful, problems and not worse, as proud, creative, and confused as other species and ethnic groups in America.
Honest civil bond is quiet from Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey's words, who intends to return after college, to work at the local government or the police, which says they need help.
And it seems younger people have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Maybe most people who just pass through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," said Alondra Kenon recently after the worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and spends some time knowing the history, it's a very beautiful city."
We're all in New York talking finances.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists weren't interested in the newspaper shop and the huge TV drives on the Times Square, they wouldn't notice that a storm was in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with glass wall-shaped, bees-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and risk fund managers who hold New York in power, they've been living the hardest days since 1929.
Couriers are still going through their metal tea trucks transporting tables with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Still men with Spanish lips hanging between the block houses, carrying fifty sleeves as human sleeves, hanging with a sleeve similar to a sleeve on their shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their breakfast sweet bakery at the cafeteria, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 a.m. on the Monday.
I didn't feel it was any crisis until Thursday afternoon in spite of every emergency news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I was intentionally planning to take care of this in my local account of my JP Morgan Chase bank during the afternoon's rest, but I've already got about 20 people ahead of me.
Not at the window of the bank banker, where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service counter where the older clients are ordering a checkbook, tourists are asking for guidance to Macy's store and where new customers open their bank account.
A lot of people in front of me, I learned from Starr later, the banker who ordered me - they were in line with the same intentions as I did.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from our so-called backups (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings funds that only operate in a single state, and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Fifteen of these banks have been ruined quietly in the last year.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars of capital, was under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers went home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, earned a bank rescue buyer with $440 billion savings.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe shelter, to the bank that buys most capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become experts in finance in the past few weeks.
A woman on the phone of the local Chinese store told me about the bank of Lehman Brothers who went bankrupt and his huge-looking director Dick Fuld, like complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, he's switched the theme of a uniform, 50-year-old caregiver at my apartment, not Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as we used to.
That's what she said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market assets.
I changed, you didn't risk."
Muslim graves were mourned while Austria billed to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Austrian Freedom Party on the Right, and Filip Dewinter, the Belgian right party, Vlaams Belang, participated in an exhibition in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008, presented by the organization "Városok against Islam's Conquest."
They have drawn up signs of transport plates that have depicted mosques with a red line.
According to the police, extremists are responsible for the disrespect of Austrian Muslim funeralrs, which took place on the same weekend when the extremism parties made significant progress in the national parliamentary elections.
There's more than 90 graves in the trailer near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David Star, on some graves, but according to the detectives, they were just trying to hide their extremity motives from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said that "they were deeply disturbed" in the hearing of the grave crawl, which was not long before the end of Ramadan, the Muslim religious month.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience study following yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the language of the political balance is right.
The two extremist parties, who received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Liberty Party and the Alliance for the future of Austria, for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were stamped as an alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who acquired more than 18% of the votes, expressed the campaign against headlines and buckets, as well as its rejection of food that could be allegedly associated with Islamic food.
At the final Vienna meeting of the party, he spoke about the "European Brotherhood", which will help prevent the strengthening of Islamicism.
Both parties want to ban the construction of fairies and minares, claiming that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
According to the public opinion studies and analyses carried out directly after the extremist winning elections, the change was due to mostly young voting bases who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign journey.
Garry Glittert, convicted of the rape of children, a known rock star, has been banned from his travel in France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months to inform him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police received a ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of judgments on sexual violence against children against Glitter.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police submitted a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is obligated to do so by the law on those involved in the register of sexual offences.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to inform the police at least seven days before the planned journey.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may refer to the loss of your freedom for a period of five years.
The Kent police told me that they don't want to talk about specific cases within the county of Glitter and about possible location.
We learned from the Kent police spokesman: "The Kent police are doing everything to protect the children within the country and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to check someone if you do not leave the United Kingdom, because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent police is the most important task of protecting Kent's population, and with close cooperation, we are constantly checking the behaviour of the persons who are registered in the register of sexual offences and who live in the county to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam prison for raping a 10 - and 11 - year - old girl.
After he got out, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have landed on a plane to London.
But he said he was feeling bad and he wasn't willing to fly to London.
The landscape authorities were not allowed to carry out the passport examination, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where the landscape police and Immigration Office officials insisted on returning to Great Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Court of Justice of West London, Uxbridge, as Scotland Yard, as requested by a court order, entered into the register of criminals of sexual offences.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for the possession of photographs of the rape of children in 1999.
According to the source of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't make pictures on the stage because I want to introduce the artist on a personal page" Günther Bauer Photographer
No decorations, no haircuts, no dancing shoes.
Without the excitement of the action, the great masters of flamenco, to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except indoor, distant moments, when we can have a personal move, grab the depths of a caught look, or admire the beauty of an artist who is not preparing for the performance of the stage.
In the film series of German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarmen is combined with these less well-known common sides of the masters.
Through the photographs, the specific iconography of flamenco is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the monthly Flamenco Photography, reflects "the growing international importance of the flamenco day-to-day" - believes that the author, adding that the Flamenco-people's "player" could be anyone, because the observer, after seeing the pictures, finds that these pictures are not typically artists.
These people on the street are artists who can take passion, sadness, cheer on the stage... and rattle the audience.
At the same time, photography on the stage is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are the deepest.
I wanted to create an inner atmosphere that allows me to inherit the identity of the giants of flamenco with the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival has launched its long journey in 1997, where portraits of flamenco singers, guitar singers and dancers were made with a record camera.
These portraits quote classic photography thanks to the camera and the topic selection.
However, the use of different stylists breaks up with traditional images and suggests modernity. The following idea reflects faithfully Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This music with traditional roots, which changes from day to day and is always impressive."
Not dancing, not singing or music alone, much more of the artist's personality, character spells the audience.
In the days, the lead motif of the works that can be seen in the El Photomatic Gallery is searching for the essence of the artistic spell, which becomes visible through the way of sensation, existence and appearance.
The known shapes of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are metals of this photographic collection of sixteen artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, of which soon an album will be released for the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauert's passion for portraits for two years has been stirred to repeat the idea by the "SportART project" series of "Vetera sporters".
Although the Flamenco-people concept is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to learn them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre in photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you bring together the fate that you don't know, sometimes, or you just want a few minutes for photography.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas.
The exhibition of Flamenco-people, selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, will be considered in the El Photomata Gallery, under the 20th number of Alameda de Hércules, by 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the novel on which he works is "toughness of blindness."
The scene and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also struggling to write his new novel. The novel's main role is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who also spent 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
Last night, the author of the Nobel Office admitted that his current work was "full blindness" and "all signs show that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I was smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm gonna do it and I hope that I'm going to make a point at the end of it sometime," he closed his speech with these words on the festival of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which in the city of Aqueduct has adopted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature and replaced the hopes it gave.
Llosa Vargas won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of the Dickens "Our Friend". His presentation filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The audience quickly aroused the hour during which the Perun writer told me about the special adventure of his reading passion and the calling of his life to live; how he relied on the inspiration of inspiration with a disciplinary written method, with passionate documentation, with many improvements and rewriting; how he found his author's calling Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what monuments he built on.
The Latin-American novel admits that it is impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books change our lives, but added: "I don't think literature has a purely fun or a life-like experience," because it has an impact on people and thinking, so he asked the writers not to allow them to seduce relief and to bear responsibility for their profession.
The most recent weather makes the Pozoblanco farewells shorter, the horse bulls.
The horse bulls that were traditionally organized as the end of the Pozoblanco holidays were removed from the show yesterday morning after the future horse torreadors found the arena field unfit for the battle.
Consequently, the Committee decided to miss the agreement between Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
The weather retreats have thoroughly retarded the celebration series, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rainfall left me with the second bullfight.
The future leaders, José Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco would have fought their bulls.
So they only kept a bullball on Friday.
The winner, Daniel Luque, took three ears home as a trophy, and after the sophisticated and aesthetic battle, he was rounded on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante received a lot of recognition and trophys, but it was more due to the audience than its own performance.
After this, however, El Juli, who has little contributed to the aging of the reputation of the Arena Los Llanos.
After a trip with the second bull, most of the audience got out of the ditch.
In Álava, a two-tonne habitant van tried to escape from road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
Basque Territorial Police conduct traffic control in Armiño (Switzerland).
The authority stops a van in which two passengers are travelling, and passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of abdomen, was not visible.
The detectives persecuted the passengers, and one, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., was reported by the Basque Government Department of Internal Affairs.
The man captured is accused of drug trafficking and forgery.
The case took place in Armiño’s administrative area where Alavai Forgali Supervision staff carried out traffic control over the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and then left the inspection site.
The detectives were chased, and then the vehicle stopped a few kilometres from the downstream, and his passengers fled from the motorway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily branded van, he booked a shipment of 2178 kilograms of hash.
The rear part of the vehicle has been carried out by the police bodies to undergo a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the vehicle's fake plate does not match the data contained in the van's papers, and therefore the arrested person is also subject to a procedure for falsification of the public document.
The Basque Regional Police will continue the investigation aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, escaped from the motorway and, on the other hand, the origin of the busy drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was sent to the police to carry out the necessary interviews, and within a few hours the court measures were taken.
He was arrested by an actress Heather Locklear because he was driving under the influence of the medicine.
Heather Locklear was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) during the weekend by the Melrose Place series, because he was driving under the influence of the medicine.
According to one witness, he tried to leave the parking lot with strange manoeuvres in Montecito, declared one of the spokespersons of People's magazine in California's traffic control.
According to the witness, 16 hours around 30 Locklear "wrapped the gas to the floor, stretched the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in front and backwards, and went over the sunglasses several times."
Soon later, the witness who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in his car, which partially paralyzed his motorway traffic.
"It seemed like a crawler," so patrols took him to this specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the speaker also said that according to the first impression of the officers, they thought Locklear was under the influence of the medicine.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving an unidentified drug. He was transported to the local prison around 19 hours, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out two months ago from an Arizona Sanatrium where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Andalous Federation to deal with the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the IU and the United Left said today that the regional federation of the regime will decide on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, the former Council of Youth and Sport, Seville. Silva renounced last week, after accusing his family members of being abused by his position.
"In these matters I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is certainly a matter of the competence of the Andalúz organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure to be applied by the party against the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the president of the IU stressed that, in the course of finding out possible irregularities by Silva, the "transferability" must be considered: "The IU has always gone to a level in order to ensure that such cases are maximumly transparent."
He added that part of the training "the strict ethical code for public servants".
"May blood", the epic creation of Garci
The work of Benito Pérez Galdós inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-Franciaal uprising of the Spanish in Majusi blood, which, with its budget of almost EUR 15 million, is the greatest form of his film.
Accordingly, the director has tried to illustrate the astonishing human flood and social analysis in the work of the known novel writer. Today, in the film presentation Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the public audience of the actors.
More than two and a half hours of Majusi's blood is presented in the movies on Friday, and later, Telemadrid will be screened as a mini-series of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdos' literature, who made his childhood dream with this shoot. All this was thanks to Esperanza Aguirr, because he gave him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the May 2nd anniversary of the Madrid events. Garci accepted the request on that condition if the basis of the story was given by the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget was financed in full by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: it was possible to introduce "the disturbed Spanish, who were wrongly side by side, because the fight for independence has led the country to a tremendous recession with the reign of Ferdinand VII", said.
However, the director regretted the fact that he could not count with the budget of Alatriste or Goya who kicked more than twice the May blood. It was therefore forced to skip some scenes from the script, which, more than many times, are signed together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So Casting was not because Garci thinks it's a "manalist", and as he said, "the director's craftsmanship is part of the theatre and movie to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
More actors of May blood, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, weren't first in front of their cameras.
Garci - who can boast with four Oscar marks and an Oscar award - believes that the year of Spain representing the Hollywood Academy, i.e. Majusi's blood, the seven French biliard tables and the finally vacant sunflowers, one of the young generations of the Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented" - said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this movie.
"In this case, you think you're working for the afterlife, and then you realize that only happiness is important, and finally you're happy to have another movie done," says Garci with a 30-year-old professional career behind her back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville makes me remember a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old, from the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalúz (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women’s equilibrium, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the wear of a woman's freedom of movement.
He exploded a dancing and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life shocked Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and he recommended me to see Tórtola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell his life history, but to capture his soul.
I remembered the addresses of her dance flamenco styles.
For example, the "pilango dance" for the guaji or the "snake dance" is tango.
"He danced vigorously, and others say it's my style, too," he says.
The performance is highlighted by two exceptional actors: Miguel Poveda, after the open door, sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with an exceptionally former disciple.
"Matilde shapes the older tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad that you said yes to the request, it's a great pleasure to perform in my play."
In addition, the production includes Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, singers of Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pajaro hitting, Rafa El Viola bouquet, and Juanfra Juárez, who plays "the true diva constant character with love."
The piece also presents a large part the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and will also go to distant landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
"That's why I wanted to make her remember because her personality had a great influence on her own age, but they don't know her nowadays and they appreciate her work even less," says Bayón.
The performance begins tonight at 20 p.m. at Lope de Vega's theater.
At the end of Triennium, "A newly married poet's journal" will appear.
The first illustrated edition of a newly married poet in Saint Stephen's Church (New York) will be presented, where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married to Zenobia. The presentation is part of the programme series of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organised by the Cultural Committee of the Andalúz Regional Government at the time of the Fifteenth anniversary of the Nobel Office Prize and the anniversary of their two deaths.
In this way, the final time of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-examination of this work, the re-examination of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize Poet and the "Juan Ramón Jimenez: The bright summer tree". The exhibition was opened in May and is scheduled to visit New York by the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalúz Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies from a journal of a newly married poet named by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most wide-ranging poets.
Without Paul Newman, it's not even that attractive America.
"God sometimes has perfect people in the room.
That's what Paul Newman was like."
The quote comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with Newmann in the film The victims of the sensation and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman's death caused in the American cinema and the whole of America.
How hard he's got Oscar.
retired in 2007,
and he was publicly ill,
But even after all his deaths have begun.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings in words, and I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "being a better life and this country."
No one was afraid that it might become ridiculous or exaggerated.
A cinema and one of the heroes of home went away in a particularly dark period of time, which was shadowed by fear of terrorism and market relations, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When it comes to such difficult times and many people easily lose their virtues, and there will be very few people to whom we can look up, there must not be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, the plátói sense of beauty and truth has been physically immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, starting with the memory of the first-born son who died of drugs until the creation of his home-like biofood.
It was a real gift to a country that could hardly get over his feeding culture.
The surprising wave of admiration has gone into Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says he wasn't a man, he died of a time.
Another English, Oscar Prize Sam Mendes, stated that his joint work with Newmann was clearly the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspirator.
George Clooney, who might be one of the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: they demand honesty and a life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
Still, there are people who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
Once divorced, but after fifty years of faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward, and there would certainly have been many occasions for infidelity.
"Why are they eating hamburger somewhere else when you're home waiting for fried meat?" he was joking.
In heaven, you can be proud that the daughters of the earth are also fans, which is not too common in America.
"He was not as proud of any of his designs as his loyal husband, the loving father, the caring grandpa and the devoted man-friendly role."
The Hot Way of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympic, and after the 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we're out of the race last night, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect competition, but I think it was the worst of all the things I've ever been.
It was characterized by a congestion of insensitiveness, and if you had to evaluate it, and I'd be the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
Now, let's move in line and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began by taking over the number, because it was necessary to arrive early.
This is not a problem on its own, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid the job in the later line).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the serial number was transferred (the first insensitiveness, just so to go there soon) and (the usual line after work), how surprising it was only S shirt (the second insensitiveness because I have the size of XL)!
What world do we live in?
Or is it a crisis that makes you decide to save your material and just buy cheaper, small shirts?
Anyway, these things are still shattered compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the terrible early take over the chip, the job took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11000 people.
So, as it was expected, the competition started, and we haven't sold the backpack yet, and when it finally happened, it was even worse.
Moreover, the rain has made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes of waiting for the uprising and stand-attack attempts.
I think we're gonna get some 500 of them inflammation tomorrow, and some, including myself, we're not gonna get our placement in our real time, because I assume my chip has wrongly confirmed the start.
If I were asked about the perfect race, that would never happen to me.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Searching for a virtual Microsoft reception
During the MIT Conference of the Intelligent Technologies, Microsoft has presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or a vehicle in the company’s area of Microsoft) on the basis of information heard from the discussion.
This "receptive" is a camera and a format and facial recognition system enables you to recognize how many of them are in the room, even who they are, note what clothes they wear, and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group people on the basis of the discussions.
On the show video, the receptionist will identify a third person, but he knows that he is not part of the company that speaks with him and is not the employee of the company.
She asks if she came to see someone and she'll make sure she's in a hurry to help her.
Without the blue screen.
Fascinating.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has a more important business to do, for example, to develop a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people were staggering to change the Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain less accompanying programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were running the necessary programs instead of a lot of commercial garbage, then the machines would be five times faster - brave, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish waist, given that Microsoft has added additional functions and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
The change in directions will come back.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is getting backwards and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google did the first step to become a Windows competition.
Many have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it must be counted with the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but relatively.
Ballmer’s weekly statement underpins this thought.
People are increasingly paying attention to the operating system and increasing attention to the web browser.
The computer will only be turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we spend in the windows' world.
What, then, is a large part of the applications associated with the system?
The less sometimes is more.
And Windows 7 is less, it's got to be much less at the Vista.
It's less difficult, less downhill, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services more on-line and ultimately provide an alternative to Google.
All of this is what they need, and I'll give you an example of why.
I made this photo at the beginning of the month in a co-worker designed for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster calls them to use the company's browser. - "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft developers used Google to browse online.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been reported to slip.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but will arrive at the end, in fact, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to put Windows 7 together and Windows Mobile 7 into the market.
The cell phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the slipping, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing this in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Véres, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Cross, as well as one of the founding gay shopping audiences.
And even if we're on the list of specialities, we can recall the peaceful figure of the migratory circus crooked weight lifter.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, the "tank", as they call the English lips, but the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can't compete with any of their competitors.
First of all, because of the elegant name - although amongst friends, it's just called "Marcel" - that's due to sport, the legend says that Marcel Cerdan was named from the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, Unisex's custom, special emblems, and a small (also recognized) Belgian flag also reveals its competitors. These are the most outstanding models that are hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company isn't just making tank tops.
Sportsfells, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool trousers, seafarers, baby suits, mini-series - and we can still list - are all the products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Even though it is regrettable that they should be wearing as a underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I would love to be a young mother; no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but he managed to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
Currently, the Nurse Cruzs want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modelling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls give their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of the new headquarters of the Mango company in Paris and the transfer of the highest fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
Gaining warmth and mildness are coming out of it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We are presenting the new autumn collection of Mango, which was planned with my brother Penelope. In addition, we are taking part in the second invitation to the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the galaxy for Valentino in the Opera.
It's a pretty busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; there's a lot of things we've taken over.
And then, many times, I'm just walking around the city and watching women dress, how to change and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite timetimes.
You work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
I think that too, but finally these three things are linked, because they have a lot of common points.
I was interested in clothes when I was little, and I was looking forward to getting to my grandmother's dressing suitcases.
Well, that was you on the Canaanite, almost got up with a cheerleader.
And then, as a dancer, I've always tried to watch my dressing.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for lessons and trials to enjoy ourselves looking into the mirror.
And in the actress role, you'll really match your role when you get the costume.
See, it's all connected with everything, and all my respects to designers and professionals.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever been, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it, they're already experienced enough, and they're making less mistakes in life.
Biological clock doesn't bother me.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I've been doing since I was a kid, and it's gonna be a big internal happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born as a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
And as for the future father, whatever it is.
I'd like to raise my child in happiness and in great love.
Let's give you a few words about the cinema, and last year, you've been shooting a lot of movies they haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started at the theater, am very impatient and restless, want everything right now, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to show you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you're gonna say to them...
I know you've been debating Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go up to the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was arranged for the benefit of his own organization called women for a better world.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
They're carrying so much of it, so I know it, and I can make sure that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand up, I'll do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is a stake, I don't know impossible.
The relapsed DUIs will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would require a vehicle to be installed in a structure that would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver is in a drunk condition or is not in the structure.
The proposal was presented in June, and the State Prosecutor Office is currently dealing with it, according to which the pilot project will take a year.
Since the project aims to return to the market, the driver will also have to participate in a recurrence course on transport education.
In addition to the Transport Safety DGT and the Institute for Safety Technology (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of the cars arrested several times as a result of driving drunk are in the car again.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air inhaled. If it is greater than allowed, or if the driver has not even blown into the device, the system will not allow the car to be started.
The cost of more than EUR 1000 would be the infringer.
A study in 2007 on this issue proved that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of irregularities by up to 65% in the first year after the installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure focuses on two reasons for infringements: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the normal framework, while the necessary reform of criminal law would require a basic amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party to incorporate the system into school buses - on the French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at the date of the programme, 17 at 40 minutes was landed in the Chairman Hangar of Benito Juárez airport, the Spanish Air Force Asturiasi Hercegi Party.
The day was on the way down, but it was so fired that only by using our hand as an eyewitness, we could see the royal party coming out of the plane.
On the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other ambassadors stood.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver on the street, if he knew that the Spanish Hercegian couple would come to the city for official visits.
Well, that's great, there's no airport transfer from here to here for a long time.
No, no, sir, the lady Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Prince of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the airport soundar in the red carpet, the coroner of the 27 Marines, who are protecting dignity.
The Prince, smiling in sea blue dress, and then the Princess, he's got the wind in his long hair, in his backdress, but not in the usual toes flashing shoes - they may have warned me that he's threatened by a storm in Mexico City.
They'll stop and smile for the cameras for a second, and then enter the room where the official bet comes.
In the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are awaited by one of the reporters of the Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee
To give a fashion prize, the world's best place is undoubtedly Paris, and from today's fashion designers, Valentino is the most sophisticated and most prominent.
Mango recently announced the second proposal for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims at internationalising the young talents of the fashion industry.
The main prize is EUR 300.000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the first tender won by Belga, was seen in the front hall of Mango in Paris under 54, and it was a little bit easier to get it.
By the way, this company's second largest European business and recently opened 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is located in London.
In the midst of the greetings and the thank-you statements for the chairmanship of the jury, Valentino, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner in Garnier Opera in Paris.
The presidential table of the galaxy made by Mango was even more visible in the company of the most enjoyable Chagalok.
Nati, whose brother recently died, came with a hard heart and sadness, carried a piece of the Company and some of the respiratory deliciousness of ELAH.
Andik, the owner of Mango and the host of his house, invited the guests. Rotchil Baron was so lonely that they were finally missing a suit because they both gave it to a woman.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own design pants and shirt and had a sexy long black dress at dinner. During the night's operation, Gaya Toledo became so entangled in the ballet room that recalled the old days, he was insulted to one of the rods and a grand plie-like.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but he showed a few photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, Oliver Martinez, we could enjoy - he's going to be two metres tall and motor - and John Travolta also arrived at the intercontinental in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said well that he didn't want any smell in the room.
Stars under the sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000, and there is one way to turn it off from the chaotic and messy everyday days.
More good news is that we can find them all in one book that arrives at the bookshop on 30 September to bring peace with us.
It's almost awkward the clock circumstance at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how fast the world forces you to live today.
The office's name is tension and the computer's back pain.
The stress is the population disease of the 21st century.
But the struggle of daily fatigue and the reluctantness of labour problems are not one and no two ways.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution to its most favourable and free moments.
The stress work bears the title of the 1001 relaxation method and the priceless rest comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK's publisher to the bookstore.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will undoubtedly struggle in his faith.
In fact, it also serves with other ideas that help to relax, for example, tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and become the central problem of your stressful life, it is time to rest in the room, relax and concentrate on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think about those who wake up and tell them all about what happened to them that day, but to those who talk to them during sleep.
At first, the phenomenon may seem scary, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This good-looking sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
Very common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more of them have been told that he was talking at night.
Frequency may be completely rapsodic (e.g. only once occurs in a high fever disease) or more regular (day, weekly or monthly) and usually the child doesn't remember anything the next day.
Your display cannot be reinduced for one trigger.
It is often coupled with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night alarms, nightwave (enuresis nocturna) or sleeping, but it is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, a condition of high fever or a stress situation or an excitement of excitement may be accompanied.
In any case, it was not studied so far.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It may be silenced, calm, it may be inconsistent words, rumbling, but, unlike all this, it may occur in the form of screaming, crying or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intensive, it is recommended to observe the child and to contact a professional. The study can explore whether there is a problem that causes a major anxiety in the background and thus offer a solution.
As we have already mentioned, this is a good-looking phenomenon, and there is no cure for it unless it is associated with a different form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, here is a preventive measure:
Let us make sure that the child stays calm before bed.
Choose reassuring games and avoid the child looking at terrifying or aggressive TV shows or series.
We teach children who tend to relax or become more nervous to relax, to help them find their inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep calmly.
If you start talking while you're asleep, we'll try to keep our rest.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful counsel
Don't wake the child.
It would be unnecessary because the child is unconscious, but he'll get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if there is several times a strong anxiety accompanying the phenomenon, it is recommended to turn to a professional or to reveal what causes a great deal of anxiety from the child.
If you speak understandably (this is the rarest case), do not start asking about anything.
It would be unnecessary anyway, because while sleeping, it's not so conscious that you collect your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you can't see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the heard and any conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can question his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally, Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and regained victory in the homefield.
Although there wasn't a fergus game, the yellow blacks were in several situations, from which they finally could win one by using them.
The speed of the match was not too tight, because the attackers felt hard to get the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was accompanied by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was just touching the upper corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeuser was overlooked and followed by the shootings: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, and Hirn's shot came up above the gate. Romain spiccel, and Diebold also tried to squeeze the protection of Dannemarie with a distant attempt.
On the other side, the players were protected in a block comprising the middle track, and only the perpetrator Riahi was in shooting position.
The second half-time was promised to be crucial: first, Riahi and Temporale were in position on the Dannemarie side. After the first goal was born: after the first shot of Diebold, the illhaeuserni Marais took the ball out with an excellent location, and then the capuba delivered it (53. minutes).
However, Illhausern’s winner could not have enjoyed the glory for a long time: 12 minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue to fight in human harassment.
But Dannemarie could not take advantage of his advantage: they did not cause a lot of trouble to the domestic team, who were just a little behind to strengthen their protection. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make an exit to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration carried out by fishermen paralyzed the number of breton and normann ports, so the Republic president decided to visit Le Guilvinec's port of Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised that the President would be adopted in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "conclusive proposals".
The presidential visit is now coinciding with the "Criminal Committee" meeting, which was set up by Breton fishermen in order to start action against the increase in gas oil prices, as the oil price exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the President David Martinon, the President of the Republic, the President will "negotiate about how fishermen can help companies recover their competitiveness and make the conditions of employment and wages safer for sailors".
The fishermen are determined to expect Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Tuesday morning, there were traffic slowing demonstrations in Morbihan and Calvados county, which resulted in almost 10 km long distortions.
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-île have not been closed.
Quiberon was placed in the peninsula with roadblocks.
On Monday, sailors have already witnessed their determination. Then, in the morning, tyres and pallets were lit in front of the fuel warehouses of Brest ports, while demonstrations were carried out in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. In the Vendée county Sables d'Olonne, for example, the fishermen did not board the ship, while some 20 ships in Le Havre prevented the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in Loire-Atlanticque county, ended the huge Total oil refining block in Donges tonight.
However, Boulogne-sur-Mer's fishermen decided to wait for a Wednesday meeting in the Ministry with further steps.
In the Le Guilvinec, the Committee on the Maritime Affairs must decide on the next step and participation at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Tuesday.
However, some of the Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee because the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "the fishermen do not allow their demands" and "they are not willing to travel to Paris" said, for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for their litres, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil falls below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" at the home of connecticuti, 83 years old, due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes were also honoured by an actor dedicated to the cinema and profession that died at 83 years of age, Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the crisis that threatens the world economy, Brazil is planning to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest aeroplane manufacturer company, Embraer can keep the plans and plan to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the president of the company.
In the first semester, the company shipped 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer company is largely dependent on the Chinese market, especially for the 30-120 passenger aircraft.
During eight years, Embraer delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group's insurance company, set up by the US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay its predecessor $85 billion - reported the dominant cost of Financial Times.
In addition to the international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would differ from a large part of almost all other business sectors - the newspaper, which quoted close resources.
According to Times, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evenings to examine the possibility of sales.
The AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets intended to be sold by AIG include the airline leasing company International Lease Financial Corp, the 59% share of the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments - adds Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
The AIG must have access to liquid assets quickly to repay a loan of $85 billion approved by the US Government, thereby charging the risk that even its capital needs to become from 80% and that it also loses its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
Study of Paris Historique on the historic meeting of Morning Meeting
The New York stock exchange reported a historically significant decline on Monday after the Senate refused Paulson's banking rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which has never been seen, represents almost 800 points of reduction) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) fell 777,68 points, so it closed at 10 365,45 points.
The largest decline in the index (684,81 accuracy) was registered on 17 September 2001 when trade started again after the terrorist attack of 11 September.
Nasdaq 199,61, based mainly on technological papers, closed at 1 983,73 points, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106,85) to 1 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange has already insulted during the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the banking rescue plan for restoring the market balance, it began to take a deep flight.
The Members rejected the provision of funds requested by Henry Paulson by the Minister of Finance by 228 votes against 205 'yes'.
Nearly two-thirds of the Republicans voted out.
"The market has dissolved bad signs because it seems that the Congress is unable to approve a plan" - says Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyzer.
"It also shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed his concerns about the fact that if a few days later they would accept such a plan, it would be too late.
"If the plan is actually condemned to death (...), then on the Fed (American Central Bank - the contract.) and on the other central banks will be in a row to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to tighten up" - warn Brian Bethune, the headmaster of Global Insight.
Piegza adds the sense of emergency: "all day after day another and another financial institution is bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities ensured that Wachovia's banking business is purchased by the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has taken emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux States, Iceland and Germany.
The bond market is substantially unsustainable.
The 10-year long-term public bond yield decreased from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday night and from 4,357% on the previous day to 4,161% on 30-year-old.
Obama won the first TV pair
The two U.S. presidential candidates were on Friday, the first debate was followed by another follower, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be made out of the battle as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both the Republican and the Democrat campaign's officers told themselves the victory in the television bargain that a third of the American households were following.
According to David Gergen's political analyst, although John McCain's actions were respectful, it was not proven to be "surprising" to stop the decline in popularity: this is demonstrated by surveys made five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the candidate for Democrat is more in the fight: the results of public opinion research published on Saturday show that Obama has a five-point advantage against McCain (44% and 49%).
In the most counting, even undecided voters, 39% of the respondents said Obama will win, while 25% of them will count on McCain's victory according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage with the great part of Joseph Biden's promising Thursday's role. Biden is preparing a rival with his first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be welcome to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts."
McCain, who has been in the seventies, never misplaces his own unquestionably immense foreign policy experience. He emphasises, however, the opposition's "navitation" in these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems, Senator Obama doesn't understand," said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed for the presidential position", said McCain.
This is the main assault surface, which has been used by republican television ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, however, stressed that he represented the future.
He didn't allow you to be disturbed: he was confronted and precisely complained.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama's already yes" has backed up the democrat ad this weekend, which is pointing to the Republican leader's view that he has still not measured the impact of the crisis on the American "outer people".
"In ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but none of you" said Obama yesterday before 20 thousand people gathered together in the rain in North Carolina for the constituent meeting.
He hasn't even dropped the words of "central class" or "workers" in his mouth. The messy situation in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, who the Americans think is the most suitable to save the economy at the edge of collapse.
"The next week may be a turning point" - believed yesterday by Charles Schumer, the influential democratic senator.
According to Ms Rahm Emanuel's Democrat, one of the Clinton Government's veterans, Obama's "in the economy" has such excellent incentives as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the President-in-Office of the Democrat, the current crisis is "the final judgment on the bad economic policy for the eight years, which George Bush created with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite the stock exchange fluctuations, it would be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. It added that its primary objectives include the creation of the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both candidates were cautious about the issues relating to the bank rescue plan amounting to EUR 700 billion (470 billion): the very unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was a choice here?"
Young people and opponents were protested on Sunday evening at the capital of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the voting posts, hundreds of Belarus gathered in Minsk, to protest against falsification of election results.
Although no results have yet been published, many young demonstrated president Alexandre Lukasenko said, "Diktator, give up!".
Some people admit that they didn't even go to vote: "Why would I go? They're doing what they want with my vote!" says a young man.
The demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which tried well to indicate itself to foreign observers in order to build a relationship with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were cleared by the observers, they could relieve the sanctions against the country in which they refused the visa from 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were separated from the electoral committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the voting counting" - said Potyemkin Jurij, who was organized from the twelve parties, who was a spokesman of the very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were only nominal" - emphasises Mr Milinkievics, the opponent of the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement.
If the delegates of the opposition enter the Parliament, it means that they were appointed and not elected.
However, their access to Parliament will allow them to have a seat in television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit proposals for legislation.
The opposition must therefore draw the picture of political life because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
That is because if our seriously debred economy against Russia is in a crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk being under Russia's resilience.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the process of election, will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They emphasise that the participation rate appears too high, and the widespread organisation of pre-voting (26% of the electoral citizens in Minsk) has enabled any manipulation.
"You have noticed that there was a choice here?" - asks the question of the leader of the Social Democrat of Kozulin Alekszandr, who was released from prison as the last person in August this year, where he was held politically imprisoned.
No one abstained in the voting posts.
And there will be no more than five opponents in this Parliament, and those who are most in line with the leadership.
On October Square, the silence of the night goes down again.
In the television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee are pleased.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his founding yesterday. Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason for the celebration because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective bloodshed companies in the world.
And most importantly, you have recovered the confidence of people, which has severely deteriorated in the effects of the scandal of blood infected in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood reserve treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service was infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general confusion of Canada, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a formal investigation with the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, which was designed to highlight the circumstances which led to the tragedy and to propose proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, some provinces set up own committees to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee performed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one was Hema-Québec, the one who served Quebet, and the other was the Canadian blood supply company responsible for all other areas and the two territorities.
"When Héma-Québec started its activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the area, we have managed to restore people's confidence." Décary states proudly that almost 94% of the québec population in early 2008 considered Hema-Québece to be reliable.
Doctor Décary does not forget, however, that "reliance is extremely fragile".
Since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when new people have been infected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - the doctor who has been managing the company since the founding of 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
That is why we have been relying on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, saying that if we are insecure and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we have to take exclusion measures.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who spent more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, it was clearly established that the disease also spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it was worth applying the principle of caution."
In 1999, there was a technology in the market that allows the HIV virus to be diagnosed more sensitively. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT) that can directly detect the virus in the blood of the blood taxpayers, not antibodies to which previously used tests have been built.
With the NAT test, we could shorten the window periphery, which takes the infection until we can show the virus in the blood with our technical tools - explains the professional.
This period could be reduced for a shorter period than a week.
This led to a significant reduction in the risk of non-infection of blood taxes and that this cannot be demonstrated.
These developments significantly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS by transfusion.
Today, there is a risk of getting HIV-infected blood, 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should disseminate 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years to make such a case happen and someone is infected with a HIV virus through a blood product.
I think anyone can accept or write blood transfusions for the restoration of health today is the first leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge of the coming decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We'll never know what a new pathogen is going into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile Virus, enters the blood with insect stings.
Therefore, we must be constantly rigged" - continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that in addition to emergency supplies, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The ageing population also increases the demands.
As anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the population of blood taxes, as the number of persons in the network suitable for blood donation represents only 3% of the québec population.
However, each healthy person, at least 18 years of age, may give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood transfusion for a year.
"We have 3 percent reserves so much that we can satisfy the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare that we're running out of stocks.
But we need to increase the number of blood taxes to the extent that existing people are old because they can no longer give blood after a while.
However, people are very difficult to convince them to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and make them regular blood taxpayers.
In this world that runs today, a man has barely had one hour to give blood." - Francine Décary regrets.
Hema-Québec, a farmer from the annual budget of 297 million dollars, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissues, which are used for almost severely burned persons.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen, then placed at the Héma-Québec, which also handles one public stem cell bank in Quebec.
A blood can only be obtained from carcinogen treated as medical waste, which can also be treated with stem cells, such as severe diseases (such as leukaemia).
"We celebrated a week ago that we entered our bank with the thousands of carnival blood samples, and we plan to take over a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of the next year, we are likely to start offering them for organ transplantation" - specified Dr. Décary, who believes that the carpenter blood extraction program is very popular these days.
"A lot of moms are sad because they have no opportunity to do this" - that is true, because Héma-Québec has no way to make this complex and costly program available in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer kick - in the predecessor of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday by 3:1 on the USL-1 cell, and reached the predecessor with the results of the sum of 4:3. This was the second and crucial match for the results of the fourth quarter, which took place in the Saputo stadium.
The final goal Antonio Ribeiro got it in 90 minutes.
While the first half-time was gone without a goal, in the second, the Montreal team also found David Testo and Rocco Plancentino in the net of the opponent.
The Sounders team alone, Roger Levesque, managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays with Vancouver Whitecaps in the predecessor.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who got off from Whitecaps at 3:1, won at 4:3, yet the predecessor came into the Whitecaps with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still being specified today.
In Dióhéj - Kovalev winning goal
Canadiens' favorite triangle is ready for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks last night, and the Canadiens finally won the Florida Panthers at 3:2 percent of the shootings at Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, acquired a goal. Plekanec, two, and Kovalev, closed the match with a golpass, which was the fourth victory of the six team's preparatory games.
The match was decided by Kovalev who obtained the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"I'm gonna need another game to make me feel really in shape."
"Took too much to get out of you in the first third", said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was pleased with the end of the game.
He's got a huge ovation."
Northern Charest’s efforts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party has barely ended, Jean Charest traveled to Jean-Talon in Qébec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), will strike the victory at the interim election to be held today.
"Resurrection of our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term objective was presented by Jean Chares at the québec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but the president was trying to focus on the point.
During his performance, pictures like "Moulin à images" were displayed behind his back.
The three gigantic projections followed each other: water plant barriers, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to guarantee that the election will not begin this fall this year, although he added that his schedule is very tight.
The "északi plan" for the fourth pillar of the "visio" of the Prime Minister Quebec's future, which is incorporated in a "new economic area", includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of conventions planned by Ontario.
In recent times, opening up to the North (i.e. the north area beginning at 49th width) was often included in the speeches of the Head of Government, but there has never been a talk on this subject.
The Head of State, however, only stressed the fact that he explained why he kept North "a tremendous treasure mine full of opportunities".
It has only highlighted some development opportunities: primarily water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which will further stimulate the growth of the countries in the precinct and the rebuilding of public infrastructures.
It is located in the north "Nigh, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds" - listed by Charest.
This is the area that is "two times the size of France," our territory, Quebec.
It is not only for us, but for us," said the Head of State, stressing that it wants a national founder to create a myth.
He highlighted that Quebec's development was largely defined by the relationship with the North: the golden fever in Abitibi, the québec design work, the Bay of James...
"This is our future," he added, after having a stage break, he looked at the giant map behind his back.
The North of 70% of the Quebec territory also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for himself, announced by the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution that all governments have confirmed.
There is a border on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government" he said.
On the other hand, "we must reconsider our viewpoint with regard to the North in the light of climate change", said the head of government talking about the northwest passage that is open every year as a result of the melting of the ice in the corner.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, taking the area in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
And what about the indigenous people in the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister stated that Quebec's government pays particular attention to them, and the plan will bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, which were members of the various parties, were already convened by the Hungarian Republic of Parti Quebécois.
Benoît Pelletier has also started to operate, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where they create a "common vision".
North development would, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly" - promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this "visio" as in line with the ideas of the pre-liberal Prime Ministers.
"Only as the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring topics of the weekend that started with the big cocktail party that celebrated the 50th anniversary of the election of Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be baptized as an obstacle to Adélard-Godbout.
"The politicians of our party, including the Godbout founder of Hydro-Québece, the silent revolution and the national spread of water power plants, or Bourassa known as the father of the Bay of James, all of them knew how to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another, true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister Roads to the North, between 1957 and 1963.
In relation to the Eastmain1a-Ruper’s blocking plan, Chairman Charest pointed out that the installation was planned for 2012.
"That's between us, but I'm planning to be there," he said to the people, and his statement was accepted by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who even said in April that there would be no choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this year's autumn, which the law would allow.
He stressed, however, that the calendar is now full, because he has engaged in tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
At the end of the week, a party meeting has proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to explain the nationalist decisions which have been approved almost without thinking.
I would also like Quebec to appoint the members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Council, and these members would have the right to bet on decisions taken in Quebec.
The opponent, however, skeptically accepted the main points of the North Plan.
The leader of the Parti Quebécois, Paulina Marois, reinitiated the North Québec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal Government in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If it hadn't been done, "we'd be keeping it a lot earlier", she believed that Mrs Marois agreed with Mr Mercure, who was launched as a candidate at the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"We want this not to be a fake play", said Sébastien Proulx's party leader, who replaced Mario Dumont from his freedom today.
Letters - A Happily Country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (also Minister of Justice), took courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt Canada as a "hamed".
So to astonish a woman who has been fighting for the truth and deserves all our admirations - that tells me a lot about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is, therefore, our government, who has not delivered his own citizen from the concentration camp in Guantánamo from one of the Western countries concerned.
This government, which absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time he committed crimes.
This is the only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, Canada has refused his word and lets a child soldier go into inhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes a puppet theater in the case while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us just remember that the Union of UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers demand that Omar Khadr be delivered home so that they can obtain a fair trial in Canada.
Our government is blind to the turtle: it does not matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed and many years of torture probably sealed his destiny for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently undermined by our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper is constantly making this word sound like an empty speech from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: you can beat yourself, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen, according to the comfort of a government leader that was so far in minority (and what can be done after 14 October...?).
Many constituents believe that salvation can be found at a party that boasts the virtue, the Law, and the Order. They do not see that this government is stretching the values of the good news and dignity of our country.
Dear Mr. Toews, this is more shame than that - don't look anywhere else.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold Orwell vocabulary
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice President-General of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada was published in Le Devoir's 17th September.
After Orwelli's explanation, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company launched a six-million-dollar prosecution trial against three authors and a small-coin publishing company in order to initiate a so-called 'explicit debate'.
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in the courts of abuse - is not brought under the law, but under the law.
It's not surprising that Garver was deeply listening to this basic difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way to ruin anyone whose position is against?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend substantial amounts of money on defence and combat in an unequal fight where, on the other hand, there is a army of lawyers supported by almost inevitable sources of mining industry.
In such an unequal fight, however, the tactic is often used to destroy the defendant and to make a friendly agreement, which is not only to silence the opponents, but even to fear those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public opinion.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is engaged, this is different, in Canada, the controversial parties are usually not twisted, but are telling their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine would have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have highlighted the question.
But it looks like Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public opinion, and a move makes a mistake in protecting the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how to initiate a 'explicit' debate if he ignores the public's opinion?
In the vice-president's head, this word is probably just the lawyers paid on the bus and not the overall residence of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus absent.
In a democratic state, even those who respect others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mostly supported by the public because they condemn the harsh manner of mine.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but it is based on civilised arguments, not by a court of silence for many. (In the context of the expression "explicit debate", Barrick Gold recently called the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal explanations, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building stones of all democratic society.
Overall, the procedure denies the right to quote authentic resources, to debate on facts and interpretation, which constitute the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss issues that do not like rich companies in today’s world, who will take courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could be done according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences of views and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's irrelevant procedure shows that, contrary to its claim, it is no pleasure to engage in an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institutions of public disputes in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures limiting legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Action - Agreed by the Democrats and Republicans
The heads of the Bush Government and the Republican and Democrat of Congress have finally agreed on the economic rescue operation yesterday, which has been the largest plan since the big economic crisis in the 1930s.
The plan of $700 billion worth, which aims to deal with the financial crisis in Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the Congress's two houses.
Important points of the plan: better monitoring of the implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied because of the lack of payments; access to the payment of managers of the aided companies.
Henry Paulson, American Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American House and Judd Gregg, a representative of the Republican who took part in the trial yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day maraton trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets", said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
"All we have done is to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street", explained the Democrat representative.
"The most important point is that if we don't do this, then there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday life of the Americans," said Judd Gregg Republican representative.
The negotiations were accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have an adverse effect on the mood of investors.
The agreement was issued by the stock exchange until the morning opening.
The two candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to agree, however, they did not welcome the fact that the situation had been increased to the end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama assumed itself that the agreement would be extended with elements such as the provisions relating to the preservation of property or the payment of managers of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of the integrity of other people, it is not a pleasure.
However, these steps are necessary", he noted in an American television show.
And when the opponent, John McCain asked about the other channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he answered: "I would like to know the details, but I hope he did."
"What I've read in great places, it's obvious that it's something that we all need to digest and that we can move on.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable" he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy the US financial institutions' doubtful claims, some kind of risk-risk unsaleable assets.
The plan has been preceded by a 14-month crisis that has been triggered by the exhaustion of the property lubrication. It has first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt securities (commercial), and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid assets and the fluctuation of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives failed the first draft agreement last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats have agreed to ensure that certain "toxic" instruments of companies in difficult situations are rather than purchased by the government.
In order to be satisfied by all members of the Congress, a provision has also been included in the plan, which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years in the framework of the programme, it may issue new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, an amount of $250 billion would first be paid; this can be followed by another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion payment should be approved by the Congress with another vote.
In return, Washington acquires a share of the aided companies by which the profits are dividends and which can be sold after the crisis has elapsed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the reservation of property covered by the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set the maximum value of wage and repayment to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like the designers to vote for the House today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not sure that the plan is approved.
Because yesterday, the statements against the plan were repeatedly expressed both among the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It's very clear that Washington doesn't hear your voice", said Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House's Financial Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a Democrat representative leading a small congress group called the "Sceptic Group", shows things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"A hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel scholars, have written to ask for Congress: don't rush and carefully examine which route he chooses", said Sherman yesterday.
In Europe, it was once again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis conference, the three Benelux states announced that it would state part of the Fortis banking group at EUR 11,2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor at the edge of the bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (2,9 billion US dollars) due to the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
85 thousand employees of Fortis are one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
"This isn't a dumped money" said yesterday, Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos, Dutch.
"We obtain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is promising insecure."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be about to state another bank that has been struck by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over a total of the current loans of Bradford and Bringley bank, of which 41 billion pounds of real estate loans (75,5 billion US dollars) are being issued.
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would buy the British bank's subsidiaries and customer records.
Bradford and Bringley after this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has been trying to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the actor service
Some say that the most beautiful eyes of the lords were the main card, others say it was the most weakness.
Has it ever been released from Narcis' mirror by the American actor with a muddy smile?
Yeah, I'm not.
Through his shame, sensitivity and congenital talent, the harsh style, which is the spirit of the real great monuments of the world of art, was also absent.
But what a huge track he's been running!
Paul Newman died at 83 years of age in lung cancer on Friday's home of connecticuti, one of the last icons of American cinema flowers.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was compared to, and long-termly considered to be a competitor in the film. In his eyes, he was more receptive and unquestionably vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood mixing is often a source of extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 with the children of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic shapes of the American dream.
She didn't think too much about you, which just increased her merits.
He was a fan of the ideal of a "self-made man" and an ideal of a warrior in the Pacific War. At the beginning of the 1950s, he studied at the play of the Yale University, then in the New York Actor's Studió, before the theatre, television, and not long ago into the world of the movie.
In addition to the fact that civil rights were victorious, he was a car competitor in 1979 in my 24-hour run at Le Mans. Besides, he was considered a sex symbol, even though he had married a happy actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know the shadows of this mysterious, confined, work-oriented actress who hated the sparkling of show business.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week was shocked by the cinema fans: in large parts we can only see on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his lifework, we've had the seventh American art, over fifty years since the cinema's constant changes.
In our memory, we have seen Tennessee Williams in Tennessee Williams, the young man who is a stranger in the "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" cowboya (1969) and his sentimental wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who is part of the Tennessee Williams.
From recent times (1990), in the image of sensitive Mr. Bridge, we can remember who confronts his age with the fact that his marriage has not changed his hopes.
In addition, Paul Newman's faces have been seen in his movies.
In Robert Wise's film "Other up there", the storm-life criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, gave an unforgettable form. It was originally designed for James Dean and taken over after his death, started Newman's actress career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Great Bad" that won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen, in his genius film "The Svindler" (1961), turned back in his film Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money" with a depressed, revengeful billiard player in 1987.
Different times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been that way.
The period of the run of the barbecue has been marked by a change in the periods.
Younger people are known mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a ice squad, is not a coach working with conventional methods.
His fans were seen in the "The Great Jump" recorded by Coen brothers in 1994.
Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Care" closed in 2003: it was the last one that appeared in the role of a Irish mafia leader.
In contrast to many of the movie legends, who left the film in relatively soon, Newman has long been in light, although he condemned Hollywood with its shining, lighting and hypocrite.
Bertrand Tavernier's French film director didn't think it was a live confusion of underplay without all the humours: he said his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always graceful with the handsome Paul Newmann, who for a long time had just fallen into his lap.
Yet, he played less young and successful characters: rather, he developed the figures of a person who lived on the peripheral of society, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless, who could return their driving and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: a very spectacular and sensitive person in the heart of his soul.
In the film "Rachel, Rachel" (adjusted by Margaret Laurence's writer's novel), held in 1968, Joanne Woodward drew the fine portrait of a melancholic woman.
The "Harry and Son", made in 1984, is a memory of his son Scott, who died in excess of drug abuse with a film that radiates retardation and sadness.
Yesterday, Newman's countless respects remembered the actress. His close friend and old warrior partner Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Hack" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "It made my life and the world better."
The joy of generosity and life: this was the secret of the vibrating personality of this great actress that we have just lost.
In addition to the career of legend, the remarks of the fight against civil rights, the environment, the independent filmmaking and Hollywood's explosions are blurred.
Many times we have seen the picture of sauce, sauce, biscuits and other foods to smile in packaging.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation for children suffering from disease.
Newman never sat on his beans: he's always committed to his profession.
In his letter to his daughter, he wrote the following sentences: "Your fathers were always and ever since incredibly grateful for his lucky stars.
It was a privilege to be here."
It's a privilege for us to come through the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag & Tsai account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial against John Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Political and fellow Members are accused of fraud and other crimes, including counterfeiting, which are particularly significant injured in a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecution, the purchased tenders were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified by untrue accounts.
Public and government money - in total, about 65 million HUF - was partly transferred to the Youth Left Cash, partly to the pocket of some people.
The method described by the investigative authority was that the tenders received were collected on the basis of cost accounts that had not been realised, and the associations have never complied with the undertaking.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
These are the yoga market, and the circulars were manufactured in Kiskunahala.
And that what companies would be called the account production, including the balaton-uproad route that John Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look like beds and restaurants.
He asked for a bill of its consumption, on which the accounts to be submitted for the proposals of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Employment and the Municipality of the Central City have then been prepared.
In most cases, István Lados took note of these reports with his partner, Andre Őr, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to obtain the aid.
One of Lados' studies was a beer house.
The two accounts issued by the Zuschlags in 2003 provide the restaurant for the ninety-person group of the Commissioner Point.
However, that much - according to the company manager - would not have been able to accommodate the restaurant at the same time.
Samely for the Better Future - later, together with the Foundation for the Third Year - issued in the summer of 2002.
A badacsonytomaji pension was only three rooms, and more than ten people were able to sleep in it one night, but the account was about a hundred thirty guests.
But fantastic printwriters were overwhelming even when the Pigal Kft. was identified as well as the Pigal Kft., whose accounting - according to the information provided to the defendant - was not included in the documents for the Better Future and the name of Hoppá.
The company's manager, Wolverine Wolverine, told Hvg.hu that when the D.A. was called and shown his accounts, he knew immediately that it was a fake document.
"The stamp was in the wrong place our company's name and tax number."
He added: for the reasons of the form, it was not correct that a hundred people were staying in the account, because they have a total of 1 1 rooms with no so many room spaces.
In addition, the account was also for food while their restaurants weren't working long ago.
The enthusiastic account manufacturers did not investigate either the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they look like, organises only foreign roads, so they registered in botor as a service on the cash payment account, which did not agree with the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as has been shown in the investigation, the document also included VAT when travelling to non-EU countries was exempt.
Among other things, the value of the VAT was mistaken in the four documents issued by Hotel Rév Philip Kft. for the Better Future, as the company’s service was not charged by the 25 % VAT, but also by the employees of the hotel only issued a machine account, and the company’s account was handheld.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have broken the bill by marking a road freight transport for a company as an activity carried out - found out by the prosecution procedure - which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, the formal differences - inadequate account format, non-real stamp - have also failed that the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the XXIth century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt or Kunfehérto Sports Camp, which were denying that the accounts were issued.
For example, the fakeers did not listen to the fact that HIB Kft. was dissolved at the time (2001) when the Group of the Society for the Young City was there, and that's why, according to our knowledge, the company's liquidator denied that he would have filed the paper.
I've been made aware of it
Another group of account issuers is made up of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account.
The Esély for Budapest Foundation issued a invoice for the Third Year Foundation, at the request of the Youth Left - Young Socialists, for about four million HUF.
Head of Collab Kft., according to the prosecution, was charged by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional account.
Also cooperated with Zuschlagek, the Biogate Kft., which is currently liquidated, in 2003, the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Army Association, has issued a roughly five million HUF bills, which were not a real economic activity.
Neither is the financial movement, as the completed accounts were postponed, but this has been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice shall be those which may be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the operator of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió was a member of Kubatov Iván, located in Budapest, which is located in the fuel and motor trade, although not located there.
The company also issued several accounts for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, approx. 18 million HUF.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd. kiskunhalasi since 14 September 2005.
This company was managing a Romanian man who would also have forwarded the documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know that during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he issued a invoice on behalf of the Kft. to Atlas, Hoppas, and Together to the Third Year Foundation, and he hired their countervailing.
On request from Kubatov Iván, Romanian stone plants were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt..
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the defendant believed was the reason they hadn't received a job.
However, it was useful to the companies because the accused partner, at the request of Sainte Zsolt at the request of a lawyer making the foundations, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of the Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has granted the entities a total of 15 accounts, amounting to HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A. believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the invoices and the VAT had struck Cubatov.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. to make fictional accounts, they were manufactured for the Officer Point.
The Y-Generation and the Alliance submitted an offer for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the Socialist Party’s public benefit organisation, the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand HUF, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
So that's not to be clear, the Works Team Kft.'s five fictional accounts were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found, by the way, during the search of the house in the office at the educational wallet of Árpad Kemecsei.
A part of the defendants in the trial, like he did at the D.A.'s office, probably reports about the process of making the accounts.
The most interesting thing can be if you're the first-time defendant, Mr. Zuschlag decides to appeal to everything.
Because Eddigi's confession is not too detailed, and although he promised several times that he spoke about everything, he has not yet done that.
The question is whether, for this reason, the large part of the damage, the 50 million forints have been dealt with by the Socialists, and Zusi will take the fall.
The person who may have been insulted by today was constantly found deaf ears in order to relieve the circumstances of his detention, i.e. his requests for domestic detention.
While the offenders of far greater damage and non-compensating economic offences can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the process against them, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overlicitation: why are we giving out more money?
At auctions buyers tend to issue more money, overvalue the goods.
This known - and apparently irrational - behavior has managed to reveal the neurological and economic foundations of the neurologic and economist researchers of the University of New York.
According to their study in Science, people do not want to stay in a kind of competition, such as the auction of eBay, so they pay too high prices.
The research attempted to map this "play" neurosystem scheme using experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played lottery, the other group was auctioned by a player, while the active brain areas of experimental persons were investigated by the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could have earned money, but during the auction game, in which the overlicitation of the other party is an essential element, a complex under the striatum, under the cord of the brain, was intensively operational when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the "rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system, along with several other functions.
According to the researchers, the price increase can therefore be explained by avoiding the rigid reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, the research group’s economists also carried out a financial follow-up investigation.
In this three groups were licensed against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they got out of the game on a winner, they'd get 15 dollars more.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of a lost auction.
Therefore, the difference between the two groups was only that one of them was underlined the loss for one of them and one of them.
However, with the evidence of neurologs' hypothesis, members of the team playing against loss were willing to make a stake higher than the control and winning group.
"These results cannot be derived from any economic theory that existed before.
They have so far only explained the phenomena of auction with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped solve the contradiction between these two theories by now having a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economic change in the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and Hungary mentions chronic liver disease among leading causes of death.
The number of hepatitis patients in the country is 100, but only seven thousand are treated, due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of the hepatitis is a collection name of the infectious liver bruising caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms, many similarities are characterised by inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the nutrient channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body weight (problem, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travellers should definitely be vaccinated against A and B virus without vaccines against C.
Hepatitis The symptoms occur in two or three weeks after the consumption of the infected food, generally injured, weakness, abdomen, nausea.
After this, the skin develops and the yellowness of the eyes, the stool becomes clear, the urine becomes dark and the healing may last for two to three weeks.
A million people die worldwide in a more severe type of disease, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, and liver cancer.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infectious receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to liver congestion or liver cancer.
Most infected don't even know his disease because the pathogen destroys his liver cells under me, and in many cases the first symptoms occur in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, and regular filter tests are carried out.
In three groups, such diseases are much more than average: people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Today, the number of chronic hepatitis C virus infected in the world is 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory study may also show the disease, it is appropriate to seek a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
In time, recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, so it will cease to contamination and prevent cancer.
The World Day of Hepatitis is September 30, which was first organized in 2004 by patient organisations worldwide.
It aims to draw attention to chronic hepatitis, causes of development of the viruses and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a painkiller, which could also facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at the University of Oxford have carried out an interesting experiment, studying the way in which God’s faith affects the sensation of pain, reported by the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electroshocks, while they were all studying a painting of a Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain-setting technique, it was also evident that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research where scientists, philosophers and theologians, alongside academics, are involved in different aspects of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by strengthening a sparkling device to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electro shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look at two paintings that Sassoferrato painted Virgin Mary in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci with hermelin of the woman painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of Virgin Mary would cause a religious state among believers, while the picture of Da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was calm.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electrosocks in four successive parts, while they either viewed a religious theme or a general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" like "careful" and "rested, they had peace".
In view of the religious image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when they saw Leonardo’s creation.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who was involved in the investigation, thinks that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even with the atheists, is only to find the appropriate photo.
"We should find a picture of someone who feels very positive about as a mother or a father." "The psychologist said.
Tom Wright Anglican Bishop welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should be done, and in many cases it will change our personality." Wright added.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter show the image of a madonna to believers, how would it affect their pain control?
Would the view of the quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share
On the 10th birthday, Google can tell you: you can find people in your pocket as much as you can find in your head in the sky; you know where you have been vacationing, what professional orders you have and what you're interested in.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the main people in the company.
However, as far as orwelli's scaryly parallel skeptics are concerned, they don't see exactly the point of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently announced to the Financial Times that the main objective of Google is to collect more personal data on their users, and that is necessary to keep themselves in the original objective of Google founders, which says: "Let's get all the information from the world into the system!".
According to the spokesman Google Leader, the company continues to manage all the information at the beginning even after ten years of world-reflecting work.
The question about what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: “You would like Google to answer questions such as "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work really fits me?" – however, until then, the software will not be able to answer such simple questions because they do not know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that the searchwords are accurately recorded in searching on the Internet, what IP address they were looking for and what page the interested people left after searching.
For example, through the personalized search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing backgrounds, look back what they were looking for and clicking for, and they will generate more personalized results for them in the long term - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations, which will offer us products and services based on our previously stated and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they see what I am dealing with? - ask users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom desire, but rebelling against power on the Internet.
However, the confirmed fact that all the phrases sought are not only recorded but may, in justified cases, be transferred to a third party; in such legal cases, there is nothing to protect the identity rights of internet users.
The most loud example of this past time may have been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles in which Google provided information on the Community site of Orkut, which it reserved, to the Brazilian government, with the possibility of identification of pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who were concerned about personal rights may have been able to take up in May when the company successfully proved to be in the court against the FBI by using the EFF's EFF's e-Justice, which says that Google cannot be forced to supply any information that the FBI has requested secretly.
(Well, the federal government has successfully fought up about five thousand websites and thousands of search phrases that have been obtained by reference to the reinforcement of the child protection law adopted by the years before, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a full web and keyword list for two months.)
Hence, the Google judgment is quite contradictory: those who keep their personal data from giving, because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private life are intimidating by starting to use Google's services and rebelling against conservative imadzsi multicompanies.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its enthusiastic, computer fans, activists, users in the next generation of large companies sees "going corporations" inside them, unlike rivals, with Microsoft booked as a world conqueror due to Windows, as much as you can fight both for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request a id code from its users in a different way than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, continuously fresh source code and the program package will be much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software guiding practice.
However, it can also be because geniuses can understand the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the internet, which is the most commonly expressed keyword of the past years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is about nothing more than college, that we deliberately leave trails behind and use the communication channels we have, and while their size varies individually, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
A average young person can lead a profile from Facebook to Xang, link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing his musical habits, and then they can all be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also lead a blog that automatically presents their latest photographic galleries that are stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
While we can read a number of examples of which are highlighted: the girlfriend can easily find out about the morning photo price of the common circle of friends, who his cheating friend spent the evening with or could fire a company's worker only because he writes his honest opinion on the top management in his blog: a certain, private life concept has been fully reassessed for now.
Anyone who lives on the Internet consists of what he shows of himself is the basic presumption that lies behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least want to avoid the Google monopoly, can do it (beginning, for example, using the Google search system, but not deliberately leaving Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not intend to register on Community sites is not possible to register them, from the text editor to the image manager and to the news reader can be replaced by alternative versions that do not bind to huge server parks and which do not set up the best profile that we have ever had.
The public opinion does not expect to be so secret when Google shows the white of his teeth.
The current value of the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints of the aggravating: for example, the upper management has completely refused the objection of employees, after having doubled the price of the company's nursery, the company's management has found it too costly to eat the employees daily, but all of it is abolished by the fact that in 2006, the Google has led to the Chinese government and, under their agreement, the company has disregarded all the findings that infringe good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company seems to not promote a new service, but only when it can be used, but it is certain that the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some think that the Google book and magazine scanning and archiving project has had such a size to face the US Supreme Court soon, others are afraid of the health system, because we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novella, the Scroogled point of Orwell, describes the future in which a person can be alertly approached from Google's data.
Two young people helped the oodi dual killer in the demonstration.
The police interviewed two juveniles in the case of the dual assassination of the oody, according to the reasoned suspicion that they were assisted in the disappearance of the crimes, said the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Chiefs's office on Tuesday.
Young people recognized the action of the terhycree, currently accusing them of guilt.
The two adolescents - according to the MTI information - are defending two girls.
Crime is punished by a loss of freedom for up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of the oedian, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's being suspected of predetermined, profit-driven, crimes of murder of many people.
The investigation revealed that a 23 - year - old young man owed a 53 - year - old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to balance his debt, so last Wednesday, his creditor was dragged into an oxy plant where he killed him, and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, which is also a sign of the murder of a gun on the scene.
The police are investigating the weapons and the circumstances of their use by expert involvement.
Warsaw's stock exchange has made an offer to purchase Prague's stock exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech krona - were offered to buy the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish people in spite of the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
That's why Varso's stock exchange is in public hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers over a few months.
The new E15 Czech economic agenda knows that the Polish offers represent the highest amount that interested have so far offered for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Praha Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Securities Exchange would be the worst new owner, and it did not rule out that this would lead to the depreciation of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5 to 10 billion kroons for market experts.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, approximately 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with about 25 percent share, followed by Ceská Spritelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. 13,5 percent.
From the perspective of the financial crisis on European pages
The European papers that lead to their Tuesday comments on the increasingly deepening international financial crisis already mention "September 11".
The global financial disaster is thanks to the President of the United States - accused by the President of La Repubblica in Rome - the President was not even able to list his own party behind a draft legislative proposal for the cure of the despair...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by a billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11.
Some of the Madrid press see the guilt in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has led the world economy to the edge of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
However, Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism occurs.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some States today can still provide rescue aid to supporting financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
However, if more banks fall together like domino keys, neither the funds nor the new adjustments will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union go beyond their national selfishness and concentrate control over the broken financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were received by the infirmary financial institutions - reminds the Vienna Der Standard that the concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, are becoming increasingly realistic in order to get into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far dealt with the crisis that sweeps as a tsunami throughout the old ground.
Savers do not have to spend almost a hundred billion euros, but it would be good to record: in which case it is reasonable to cover taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The drumfly of the dongo is prayerful of the intelligent car.
What is the best way to develop technologies that are capable of avoiding impact if not imitation of obstacle sensors in the world of nature?
For example, the bees.
In a surprising project in CEATEC in Japan, dongo bees gave the strategic starting idea to Nissan engineers how to build the next generation of systems to avoid conflict.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biopollutant motorboat control system, a robotized minicar that was provided with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all impacts.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety cover - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology for PR and Research.
The role of the bee is a complex eye, which can be seen in every direction at a angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the complex eye function, engineers touched the laser gauge idea.
This detects obstacles within 2 metres in a 180-degree BR23C vision space, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the deck microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid impact.
During the break of the second period, an obstacle is detected, and then the car bomb, imitating the movements of the bee, changes the direction immediately by turning the wheels to avoid impact.
In any other way than the current system, this avoiding manoeuvre is carried out in a completely incentive way.
"If this weren't the case, the car robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid obstacles" explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Mobility Laboratory and the driver of the car-robot project.
It must respond in an intuitive and immediate manner, as this technology corresponds to the most damaged and internal layer of safety covers, a layer within which the impact is considered to be inevitable at present.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be during a visual inspection.
However, in a different way than the bees, the difference must not be directed upwards, downwards or throughwards, but can only be two-dimensional, and only towards the reversibility of the wheels.
In such a way, only rotating movement and acceleration and slowing were used as the possibility available for bees instead of the endless possibility available for the removal of other bees.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators, which are easier and more energy density, which means that their lifetime is longer than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh believes the incentive for intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, even less store data.
This structure should only process and respond to a few in-between signs per second.
There is no need for you to keep them, and to respond with an intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, thus using only a few dozen kilometres of memory.
There's no need for a gigabay, or just a bit of a bit of memory.
This is the first step for the development of an immediate outlet technology which, according to Nissan, can be included in serial cars within ten years.
A further application may be possible for the installation of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the car to the target by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He's got a name for the poisoned child.
The written version has been prepared for the 700 billion-dollar economic rescue package law for the purchase of bank credits in more detail.
First round, half of the amount is spent.
According to the East Coast Time, the Congress leaders came to the front in the discussion of the total savings package of 700 billion dollars for days - reported by Reuters.
We have made a serious step forward - Nancy Pelosi, President of the United States Democrat, who says that the agreement is only on paper.
Both the presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise from the package.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, stated on the outcome of the compromise, that the programme will work and be effective, but there will also be further work to be done. Pelosi said this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy into a carriage.
The written version of the package was made public on Sunday night 8 (i.e., mid-European time, two hours a Monday morning) by the time of the Asian markets in Washington, but did not cause an spectacular run-up on the stock market.
The draft legislation on the law on the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act on the programme will be voted first on Monday and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - announced Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, by the way, differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have meant that $700 billion would have been spent on buying low-quality credit-risk securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the 700 billion amount can be spent using 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, this is what the Ministry of Finance buys credit-backed, bad-rated securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
The program will be checked by a separate body, which will also be attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on the new decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may use combined tactics: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities and other types of "toxic" loans at the same time.
Buying in the framework of auctions and can be done directly - the Ministry's competent authorities have been informed.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial wallet guarantees the assets that cause concerns, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law gives the necessary means to avoid up to $700 billion of the urgent needs of the US financial system, whether the widespread purchase of bad assets or their insurance or the systemic risk of collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he did.
But the heads of banks who are in trouble and waiting for State aid may expect their exit money - which is simply called the overseas slength - to be limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry is buying a auction, it is extra tax on the gold parachute unless it is sent to retirement for a distributive bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
The picture includes that the existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the limitation applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the history of the United States that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of the Directors-General - commented on the measure by the President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House, Barney Frank of the Democrat Party.
In addition, banks participating in the programme have the right to acquire shareholdings, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, since they can ultimately win the transaction as the economy and the rescued bank are on foot.
The draft law contains that for the next five years, the President shall submit to the Congress a presentation on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Both sides, of course, were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens asked for, i.e. not to protect the dollars of taxpayers - announced by the representative of Darrell Issa of California.
A colleague of the Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were called upon by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
In August 2008, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reportedly KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1% higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to one year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producers' prices were 0,7 % above the previous month and 3,2 % above the year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum compared to the previous month, by 0.1 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased to a small extent, by 0.1% compared to July.
The highest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather product sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to 4,6 per cent of the sack, foil production and 2,5 per cent monthly price increases.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions occurred in oil processing (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machinery, the production of instrument (0.9 per cent) and, to a minimum, in the sectors of wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, its publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases were measured between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the prolonged impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In comparison to twelve months, domestic sales of manufacturing industries, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
The production of metal processing products in the sector was observed with a price increase of 13,2 % in the area of food, beverage and tobacco production.
Price reductions in the production of textiles, textile products (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent) in the sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Over the last year, prices increased by 10.2 per cent.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7% higher than one year earlier.
In the domestic sales, in August of the targeted groups of sectors, the largest monthly price increase in the sectors producing investment goods was (0,7 %).
In the sectors producing consumer products, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in sectors producing energy and further use did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase was observed in the sectors producing energy and further use (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer products, price increases of 6.8 per cent and price decreases of 1.4 per cent for investment goods were measured.
The export sales prices of the industry in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, by 3.9 per cent in comparison to 12 months.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7% compared to the euro, by 7.1% compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007 by 7.5%, by 15.9%, compared to the dollar.
You don't need a visa next year to the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the Hungarian leaders.
According to his opinion, "this is in good shape only depends on whether the electronic entry or control system will be built overseas in time".
At the same time, he pointed out that the new system does not have a travel permit, but the tourists will have to register themselves before they leave.
The Hungarian Head of Diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
Condoleezza Rice meets the Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs, who transfers the Hungarian Foreign Affairs Order to the Central Cross of Honor and discussions with the Star Barack Obama's Democrat Party and John McCain's Republican Foreign Policy Advisors.
The bank rescue package is next to Barack Obama and McCain.
On Sunday, both Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidential candidates of the two great American parties, provided the government's 700 billion bank rescue package, but there is a politician who demands the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After the Marathon talks of the representatives of the Congress and the administration have been announced on Sunday morning: a basic agreement on the bank rescue package has been concluded.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the melting of frozen credit markets became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that it is more suitable than a competitor to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, Obama has once again gained some advantages, the advantage of McCain, which he has gained after the Republican Convention, with the nomination of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
At a Detroit campaign meeting, Obama expressed his hope on Sunday that the Law on the 700 billion package was quickly adopted by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer passports that he also supported.
"We have to act now, with responsibility (...) for your position, savings, all industries, the threat to the stability of the economy as a whole," said the 35 thousand people.
He didn't miss McCain's economic ideas over time.
McCain explained in the interview to ABC, "This is hard to swallow (...) but nothing is simply a way."
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal included the setting up of the Committee of Supervisors for Finance and the restriction on the closure of peasants, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no worthwhile role in the reconciliations, but he had a daily relationship with the Minister.
House president Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House is hopefully voting on the bill on Monday.
Sleeve of the German language area
The camp on the right has become intact, only within the camp, the electorates have become more self-conscious - so he analyses the weakness of the CSU in Bajoran.
Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
The article of the German news magazine on the left hand, Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution, underpins the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to known politicians, the CSU's erosion has started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo would have taken over.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bajoran countries - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of age is also the problem of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was almost almost ten years ago likely: the undisputed haemomonia of a state party has ceased.
For ten years ago, CSU landed in 1998 at 47.7%, first in the 50s, below the 50 percent level.
This has been repeated for three years at the 2005 Bundestag elections, so he mentioned so much in the Stoiber era.
This is why CSU has consistently implemented modernisation in the province, which eats his parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the pace. However, there could not be consequences for the loyalty of the electoral CSU to the developing regions of the Eastern and Northern Germans.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can be seen.
The camp on the right has become uninterrupted, only within the camp became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also evident that in the last weeks, the classic civil groups were most distant from the CSU; free-employed, industrialists, graduates and upper secondary graduates.
There's been under 40 percent of CSU's support here.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article "Who, who, who, who, who, the parties to the coalition issues of the retards," deals with the confusing internal policy situation in Austria after the elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in every direction, and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, now everything is going around the coalition; in the public service television debate, the leaders were barely allowed to see their cards.
President Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some countries and in the social partnership.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the President of the current ÖVP, as well as a alkancellor - Faymann left it open.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molter course was abducted anyway.
The recurrence of this direction is not going to happen.
Molterer reacted with caution to the red deals.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the OCTs.
In order to vote for the opposition or to enter the coalition, to date it is fully open to the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ repeatedly showed openness in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government" - said Haider.
Participation: Break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Conference on Equal Opportunities, which this year represents the Presidency of the European Union, is the host of France.
Lívia Járóka, the fidesztes of the European People's Party, called attention to educational segregation, as one of the main speakers of the professional consultations, because this is the most serious obstacle to the violations of Roma children and their application.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Mr Bertrand, the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Mr Spidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Between the governments, the European social partners and the most significant representatives of European law defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equality.
In accordance with the Fides Group's press office, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in the workplace, the Romas are mainly deprived of the labour market as a result of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality basic education, they can only gain a significant share of higher education."
Partóka also stressed that, as fundamental human rights, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the European Union Member States.
According to the Member, it is necessary to make these links aware of the widest range of Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increasing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"The Roma must ensure their right to quality education and ensure the eradication of their low-quality and separate education", said Járóka Lívia.
According to the MEP, the European Union's objective and action-oriented coherence is essential to speed up the school deseparation processes immediately, to do so with proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The evil circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be broken, the Roma children must give the opportunity to contribute as a full citizen to the future of Europe," asked Járóka.
In line with the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been organised annually since the last meeting in Berlin, is to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for Transitional Time
At the end of October, they will decide the destiny of the duo of Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the ugly electoral failure, heads have not yet died, and at the tops of the Bajoran CSU, the personal issues have been discussed.
Principal Erwin Huber and Head of State of Günther Beckstein may still be in place, questioning how long the mercy lasts.
On the last weekend of October, the 17-percental catastrophic voxural loss will be decided by an extraordinary party congress.
In any case, the members of the many judged couples perceived: they do not insist on all their strengths with their chairs.
By doing so, they tried to calm down the angry members of the group and the base who were demanding personal consequencies after the "bajor cunami" one day because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with Edmund Stoiber on top of his track - the Christian social union earned 60.7 percent, and now, one year after the Stoiber puzzle, it ran only 43.4 percent of their power.
For 46 years, CSU was a "singleman" for 18 percent of German GDP in Bajornia.
Conservatives continue to be high in the southern region of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and they will be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the redemption within the party is the Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is the potential successor of Huber, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, who will also be able to engage in a narrow exploration team that will start negotiations with a possible Munich government coalition with the Liberal FDP and the Free Players on the Right.
Fate is a strange fintor that on the Free Electors' list, Gabriele Pauli, whose actions against Stoiber were used as a pair of puzzles, and then undeniably treated with the great government politician.
The CSU's leaders are now using all their energy to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
The transition will also play an active role as Stoiber, the former Head of State and former CSU president of the political career, called the worst day of September 28.
On Monday, Huber sent a few comments to CDU, saying that they had earned much more support from the brothers and sisters.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag election in September 2009, the Chancellor cannot be a Chancellor if CSU, which plays an important role in the success of the country in 2005, is somehow not put on foot with a common force.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU's soil will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin because of the fiasco.
Which is, of course, relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest results in Bajornia since 1946 by 18.6 percent.
Lukasenko seat: 110-0
None of the opposition representatives entered the Belarusian Parliament on Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, however, this is explained by the irregularities that have been committed at the time of the voting.
The EBESZ sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the 10 million countries have been without opposition for a hundred decades of legislation, the opponent of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), before yesterday's elections, really hoped that, following the amendment of the Constitution, Lukasenko, who renews his mandate for the elections of the debate in 2006, would allow the appearance of some opposition representatives in Parliament for the fourth time.
The ODSZ thus stopped the pre-considered bojcot.
In the background of the opposition expectations, the Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia, was to improve its relationship with the EU to which Lukasenko and several high-ranking politicians, because of the political arrangement of the anti-democratist, which was classified as the anti-democratist, did not receive a travel permit.
It referred to a premature relief that the ECSC has emphasised positive movements when assessing the election campaign, not shortcomings, such as the ban on the third of opposition candidates.
However, the EBESZ's Monday's quick report has already challenged the campaign - in which opposition candidates could not, in essence, appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the accounting of the votes.
Together with this, the opposition still denies the remarkable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to take a smaller confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of South Ossetia and Abházia, although Russia, with which Belarus constitutes a federal state on paper, has already considered the two areas independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward, one behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU - said Alekszandr Milinkevics to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election in 2006, it is desirable that this should remain, even though "the power is afraid to let an opponent in the weightless Parliament."
The opponent does not intend to send a message on the need for economic reforms to voters in view of the results.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, the opposition papers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are rolling barriers to distribution, but I also see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly, said Milinkevics, referring to the regime of Lukasenko, which considers the most important outcome of social security, even the age of pensioners who have been most officially supported.
- Due to the country's debt, the increase in the trade deficit, the issue of time is the reproducing of social security which is called "the gravel silence" - believed Milinkevics.
Against the opposition politician, the Russian observers considered the elections to be a democrat.
Sergei Lebegyev, the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told Ria Novoszty's Russian news agency: "not the words, but the people believe in actions," so the lack of opposition is evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorates.
Brunetta: "Regine only before working time"
The history of Chigi Palace has uniquely installed rotating doors for the release and entry of workers.
As of today, this new measure will take place against the managers, for the deployment of those who are blocking, and then for a coffee at work.
The anti-loop innovation was introduced today by the Minister of State Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The rotating gate - said Brunetta - serves for better and more efficient work, reduction of deficiencies and increased services"
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform" - emphasised Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
Masi says "the installation of the rotating gates is also a symbolic aspect."
The secretary-general confirmed that the workforce accepted the measure, everyone cooperated.
The breakfast's over at work, there's no more coffee and brio.
Brunetta says, "A nice little capuccino in the morning at 7:00 a.m., she can do miracles."
At the Roman Public Administration College
At the meeting, the Minister presented: "In three months, 50 percent of the public sector’s deficiencies were reduced, representing six hundred thousand more people in work".
At the same time, it added that Italian administration should be made more efficient
"The wage dynamic of which, according to the Minister, was twice the last 8 to 10 years than the private sector and was much higher than the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of public-applicants gathered together, joining the submission supported by the Organisation of the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the requirements of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration boasts with data to support the reduction of disease deficiencies, the war of the undue journalists continues to grow," says the Consumer Protection Association.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered together to send wars to the illegal requirements of the Regulation."
They are attacked, inter alia, the eradication of supplementary nutrient funds for the benefit of service-related disease, the extension of the period of stay of patients at home, which means the period within which the patient may appear, and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Job accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything else
Every day there are 2.500 accidents at work, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent disability.
According to the information provided by the Occupational Accident Insurance Office, nearly 1.200 deaths occurred in 2007 at work.
The figures testify the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and demands almost twice as many sacrifices as killing.
Today, Anmil organises on the 58th occasion of the day of every county in Italy, the day of the victims of accidents at work traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and public communications.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, are also underlined by the fact that the prevention of accidents at work has a very important role", said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic of Pietro Mercandelli, the President of the National Association of the Baleseti Rokkant at Work.
The Head of State has sincerely summoned the commitment of the association to prevent workplaces, the protection of workers with accidents, the help of victims' family members and the detention of public opinion.
"The natural and honestly divided anger are caused by the tragedy of media and public opinion, but in reality we must face dramatic and repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly facing a lack of resources, financing education and information is crucial.
In particular, school initiatives aiming at direct awareness of young people who are in the world of entry into work are important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, and to need more effective legislation, which must be enforced.
The President of the House, Mr Fini, stressed on its part that "the death of the accidents in the workplace has a serious social significance for all of us, and the institutions are required to end this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a mild improvement, but the number of such deaths is still incredibly high", noted Mr Mercandelli, President Anmil.
"We do not want this decreasing trend to be coupled with decreasing consideration, because the greatest tragedy occurs at the moment of the recession of attention."
"We believe that at general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more strict supervision and control - stressed by Mercandelli - would be needed, as well as more intensive intervention in the field of labour training, from school education."
"Towards further efforts are needed to inform and dentalize the public's opinion", he added.
What would be most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticised the progressive deterioration of the compensation network for victims of accidents at work, as well as the "aid direction towards which the system is stretched in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to restore the safety of the workers' insurance, because the fate of the victims of the accident should not depend on the authors of the law where it is volatile and where the sharing measures are."
The MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Keeping hearing damage may be caused by long-lasting listening to portable playing devices, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU's Scientific Committee on Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), referred to today's opinion.
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of the remaining hearing damage may be those who listen to their music player with high volumes for more than one hour over five years a day" can be read in the explanation.
"Farmingly, young people who use high-speed music players and mobile phones are not aware of their hearings being irreversibly damaged", Meglena Kuneva said.
"The scientific surveys indicate an unquestionable risk that we must respond urgently", said the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information about this.
In the light of this opinion, we should also review existing control systems so that they can operate with appropriate efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise damage caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that we have causes of concern, and the European Commission is ready to examine in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders what possible measures could be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise from portable players and similar instruments", said the Committee member.
The current European Security Regulation sets out in 100 dB the maximum level of noise that can be released by portable music players, however, an increasing concern is accompanied by data on hearing damage caused by excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise damage that can be significantly reduced.
The scientific committee of the EU states in its opinion that those using a portable playing device who listen to music with high volumes (more than 89 decitels) for five hours a week exceed the current maximum value for noise at work.
If a person listens to music in similar circumstances for longer, there is a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of the users of the portable device, which could mean 2.5 to 10 million in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins until March, the results are expected in June.
This schedule was set up by the Municipality of the Central City for the operation of the Committee called the future of the Rome Capital, which was gathered this morning at the new location behind Caracalla's bath.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up Roman directives.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated at the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee in order to be able to present the main city strategic plan formally approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - stresses the task of Alemanno - to develop proposals for the development ideas of Rome for which political decision-makers, the Assembly and the Municipal Commission, can rely.
There is no conflict of competence, we would have wanted only a platform where great plans for Rome can be created.
In March, after doing his work, the Committee will be dispersed because of a fixed term mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the future of the Rome Capital - the Mayor of Mayor has declared it.
For those who deem the Commission's operation unnecessary, referring to the fact that the opinion it sets up is not binding, Alemanno answers: "All depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will make on the table.
If the quality proves appropriate, as is the case with the Attali Commission in France, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The power of the policy is often dissolved in dealing with daily matters and in dealing with urgent cases of time.
On the other hand, in view of our far-reaching aspects, we are looking further and planning a longer term and we are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "the Commission cannot be considered as a useless "head of water", since it will be free of charge, it will not cost a euro of Roman citizens, it will serve as an incentive for thought and aim at involving the most prominent minds of the capital".
According to Alemanna, "the need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework, which enables our city to jump in a high-quality way that he needs so much, thinking of his future in a united spirit".
On the future of which the Mayor of Rome stresses: "It will not only be limited to the current municipalities but rather farther away", we see not only the future metropolis and the capital status in it, but also the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean regions can play as a capital city and must be filled in."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A known, independent American politician wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first Jimmy Carter who made his decisions to ruin the American economy, and had close contacts (as he does it as a private man today) with the hostile Islamic.
As the election date is approaching, Obama's attacks are dense.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama thinks that it can gain the highest public dignity of a nation whose total of two governors and five senators were black so far!"
These attacks are actually nonsense; they are of course racist nature, but they do not answer the voters' question whether they will be a good president, and then there are public opinion research: it indicates that Obama will win with a significant superiority.
In this case, there is one who listens to his emotions and not to his mind.
In the inside of the South States, a Misssissippi newspaper wrote this in his headline: we know well that in the ballot the real American patriot who voted.
The side of the American thinking is here that is hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where we'll put the drink, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
They have never said such words until now when the black candidate's success is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all the cleverness, the Democrats are the winning weapon of George Bush.
1,500 people were asked about what were the mistakes made during Bush's term? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50 000 soldiers in Vietnam, and he was knocked down so that he flew home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak spot in Bush.
There's a great job waiting for George W.
U.S.: the economic collapse has already been felt by journalists, the time has come in the editorials, many people blame the Internet for the press "death".
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they feel about their future position and spiritual power.
Well, right now, almost all journalists are pessimists about their own future.
However, it was not explicitly claimed that their concerns would have been reduced in terms of credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money.
They think the crisis in 2008 is a bankruptcy of an insurmountable economic model.
There is also a serious problem for the newsroom, i.e. cuts for journalist editorials.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense that the public is talking about, to minimize it, this problem must be solved - the journalists asked.
Nowadays, well-seen and complex pessimism is characterized by American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the press are convinced that national zsurnalists are on the wrong path.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in the upper leadership position.
Printed vs electronic press.
There is no difficulty with the employees of the press to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are on their way to the Internet, which many people think is the "murderer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
500 asked journalists acknowledged that they put their line on the side of technology, in the hope that it might benefit from bureaucracy.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between editorial directors, the directors, and the reporters who work for them.
At national level, 56% of the leaders are sure that their reporters share their information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be achieved by 23%.
Some people are bringing this up to their secure workplace.
At national level, 47% of the leaders fear that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, that's 30 percent.
In America, the question of "safe work" is on the team level (for our editors, editors.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
For a large nation, like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on the basis of "need or not".
Directors are usually paid high, and editors can earn ten thousand dollars per month, in addition to their pension and health insurance fees.
Freedom, however, works rather complexly: in the first year x day, in the third year, until the maximum 15 days are reached after a certain time.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick over the year.
Everything is a climatic function.
UNIPOL: ROMIC COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola in the real estate sector, who wanted to go from Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation in the Unipol-BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, during the procedure against him, the house arrest was relieved and changed to a ban on Grottaferrat.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, were asked to visit the property specialist from the rural city to the capital apartment.
However, according to the Court, these ingases (for which the prosecutor has proposed rejection) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence raised against it.
In danger of elite
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote for the 700 billion savings package presented by the White House: a significant part of the Americans was more interested and still interested in the Wall Street punishment than saving the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times yesterday, which reports that the current crisis has resulted in a breakthrough within the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, retarded, the eastern coastal attitude that supports the federal institutions and business circles and the ever-intensive, anti-global orientation between the central and southern states.
This line was manifested in a critical way in the parliamentary vote referred to in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still happening will indicate or indicate, and not only in the United States but also in the entire Western world, perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and Europe, is only speeding up the swamping phenomena that have long become firm in this new atmosphere and will finally come to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-adaptation, the reintroduction of the dual category of public sovereignty in relation to public awareness, a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
Because the crisis affects banks-financial institutions, which, at the same time, are in close contact with the foreign country, but mainly, and rather widely, they are circulating people and families with themselves who live in a single country in a state.
However, this is a direct political challenge for the government: what to answer to the difficulties and protests of the people who are other voters.
Thus, the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms almost exclusively national.
Political internacionalism seems to have basically fallen outside the coastline: this is a brilliant evidence of the European Union, which is unable to set a single policy direction between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects intervention from individual national governments, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but in particular the opening of funds: since only individual states have economic resources in a limited situation, a financial stock that can make things right.
They also have their assets and their powers to use them: they have two sources of invaluable value, where appropriate, which are likely to have no other market and no international organisation will ever have such an extent.
Moreover, the new focus placed by the crisis on the state of the nation is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is conceivable to a growing factor which is closely linked to this element, and this is territoriality.
In paradox terms, while we were convinced that we have already entered the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world has been ordered to rule the world, we had to realize once that our future is increasingly dependent on things that are less and less occupied, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, yet can be fully linked to a restricted area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more impact cards than who is born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I'd like to go over to the second innovation, which implys a sort of break line.
Whoever says that the territory, the state, the government, is also necessarily saying: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two confusing phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition that a credible leadership is needed is for those who can deliver the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the total loss of credit for economic leaders, who have proven to be completely incompetent and proved that many of them still have a blurry area.
Together, the two are of even deeper importance and, in a way, more worrying: the feeling of credit loss, impatience, inadequacy and separation, which affects the whole elite of leaders in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the belief that the time of the social elite up to this point has expired, before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, the complex of the word, would have become their own. This social elite is becoming increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
The demand for leadership, covered in a wide-ranging but strong delegation movement is advancing against the divisor's division and the traditional political system. This is not expected by the voters in the "falls" or, in recent times, in the sudden changes in the public mood. For example, the entry of conservatives to power in Austria and Bajornia, the collapse of the working party unit in Great Britain or the repression of the American Congress representatives against Bush (and perhaps the Italian right-wing victory can also be included here).
It seems that the traditional elite, its parties, its programmes, and even its habits, the press and its ridiculous sensitivity, is becoming less and less able to represent it, which has taken place for some time in the deeper stages of the Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is increasing, spreading, and potentially capable of creating even more immeasurable start-ups.
In spite of all this, it would be overwhelming to speak honestly about the "capabled revolt of masses".
But open eyes don't hurt.
We can go with super-powered adhesives on the wall.
With a super strong adhesive to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider Man.
He has set this goal to himself by several US research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
The researchers managed to attach a 100 pound body to a vertical wall with only a four-centre adhesive piece.
TANULMANY - The American Science magazine published some of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the Scientist Group was produced from the further development of the special, so-called carbon nanoscope structures.
"We have to imagine the principle of glue as a tubing system like a package of spaghetti", says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers drew the idea from the feet covered by microscopes, which gives the animal a perfect tap.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and sleeve paper, have been confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the legs of these reptiles, while "slightly separated from the wall" - explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the engineering arm of the dayton University.
"This substance can be useful as a temporary adhesive" - adds Liming Dai.
Can we go on the wall, just like Spider Man? Maybe, but researchers think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices because carbon nanopipes are good for the heat and electrical power.
You can find further applications in space research.
Superheroes can wait.
The University of Berkeley in California is also experimenting with a new adhesive material.
According to the article published in The American Chemical Society c., California scientists have presented a hairy, microfibre adhesive material that passes through self-cleaning during the movement on the surface, which always provides perfect adhesive.
Drugs?
Grapefruit, orange and apple must be taken care of.
These high vitamin-based, especially during the summer, thirsty drinks, if they enter the body together with certain lifesaving medicines, change their absorption, by strengthening or reducing their effect, depending on the case.
The professor of the University of Western Ontario, London, David Bailey, reported the risks of the combination of carton or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving medicinal products, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and risking the health of the patient.
Grapefruitlé was already placed on the junction of the defendants when it turned out that some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety relief, cardiac rhythm control and nerve medicines could be considered to be toxic to the level.
COSTS - Two years ago, the Italian Medicines Institute itself made the news public in its official publicity and also warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that hinder the efficacy of medicines.
A long list of active substances which are prevented from absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
The Professor Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the University of Milan, draws attention to this: "The discoveries of this kind are usually immediately indicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, ensure that they change the information contained in the leaflet of that medicinal product.
That is why you always need to read the information on the medicine you want to take, and if something is misunderstanding, we should not let ourselves be influenced, but clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist," said Ansa Institute's specialist.
Paul Krugman received the Economic Nobel Award
The American Paul Krugman received the Economic Nobel Prize for analyzing the territorial links between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman, at Princeton University, is a well-known publicist for New York Times.
Krugman is one of the hottest critics of Bush's economic and foreign policy measures.
After a terrorist attack in September 2001, a few months when Enron failed, Krugman in the New York Times published control article announced that the last event would have even more devastating consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of twin towers.
This projection has had little debate, and it has been repeatedly taken to the eye of the economist, but today we know it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked that the collapse of Enron or Worldcom's scandalous collapses has moved beyond publicity", said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "popularly valuable economist", but rather "submits the criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush government in aggressive style."
Open Office, third edition was worth the "Microsoft Anti" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is presented today with an open-label software package, which aims at increasing layers from home to office users, from free-to-door applications to both administrations as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After almost one year of work carried out by SUN Microsystem and voluntary developers, the new Open Office will come forward with a number of innovations: on the greeting screen and outside the reconsidered, less shartai user interface, it will also offer several important innovations. For example, Apple Mac OS X is compatible with the operating system and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to the ISO standard.
Particular attention has been paid to the availability of Office 2007, so the Open Office can open newly expanded Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some modules have a specific function, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presenters. This can be useful for sending files by email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a graphic module by keeping the site layout.
Also on this surface we can create "hibrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the table managers or text editor elements.
The sharing of applications has also been through a number of improvements: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents the work of each other from being overwritten.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice's features available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the weeks to come.
The Italian version, after being found on the mirror sides since Friday, can be downloaded from: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The package is also available for Linux outside the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
At the request, we can take the installation CD either in our home or in our workplace.
In view of the spread of home application, freeness is probably the greatest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can expect a number of administrative and school projects.
They do not lack ideal education, counselling and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business distances.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a Word-compliant text editor; Calc, a table manager for the replacement of Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is like the most well-known Access database manager; and eventually Draw the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, if we take into account that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this figure will probably be higher than the expected.
Kohl also positive, this is the fourth dopping case
During the last stage of Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, played a positive sample, who also won the trico for the best mountains next to the bronze.
The news was on the Equipe Internet page.
The 26-year-old Kohl was the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German, Gerolsteiner competition Stefan Schumacher, who produced positive results on the third-generation version of the EPO on the ceramic test.
Similar to the blood sample of Kohl in recent weeks, laboratories in Lausanne and chatenay-malabry have been tested.
If the control tests confirm the positive results of Cera, Austria loses its third position and prohibits competition for two years according to the requirements.
The report on the positive results of Kohl's third-generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Dopping Agency and reported to the Associated Press News Agency: announced the positive dopping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrias managed to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the best mountain trip.
THE NEW YORK THINGS ARE YOU GOING TO WORKING THE WORK, IN ITALY?
The country of immigrants in Italy has only recently become one of the popular destinations of the hosted immigrants.
This is why "Belpaese" becomes a racist nation? This is the question of New York Times, which, from the case of young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits - is devoted to a long article about the debate on racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what the New York Times call a "fair paradox": in the northern regions, "the strongest integration and the highest employment" is, however, the support of the immigration enemy and the North League " is also the strongest in the country.
To support increased tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the grassland in relation to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were introduced as an example of a change in the mood in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the President of the Papa and the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met the XVI Bened in the Quirinale Palace and urged the state and the Church to work together to overcome racism."
Students pay expensive rental fees, even €900 for a room
The crisis does not affect the market for accommodations issued to universities.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia Housing Office, a student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now filled in such amazing sizes as the head of the Sunia study office, which, due to the total corpse costs of families, eliminates the widespread levels of students from learning", explains Laura Mariani, the leader of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market to the extent that a general process of gratification has also begun against local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no rental restrictions, linked sub-rents.
Sunia argues that an exceptional measure would be necessary to maximise prices through the review of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in Brianza, the price of a single room is 450 euros per bed; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (in the vicinity of Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach 900 euros (in the vitoria).
In Florence, a single bed costs an average of EUR 350/400, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where the students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed cost €250/280 if it is double and €370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, some €600 will be requested in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) for a single and 450 bed in a double room.
Something cheaper (550 euros a single room) is the prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
All can be saved in the outskirts: 300 euros will cost a bed and 450 in a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In Naples, they require EUR 300/450 for a bed, for a room between 400 and 600 euros. The price is highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed has to be paid EUR 250/350 and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are even lower in absolute value, but represent a higher weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Peru, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rental fee requested from foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian renters.
See you, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema halls sacrificing in towns.
Traditional movies are closing in for the benefit of Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures made by the director Giuseppe Tornatore are effective in showing everything that takes place in the Italian metropolitan cities, but also in rural regions.
Constrainting the movies - the appearance of the large multi-stage movies in the outskirts, and thus the division of one-stop shops in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time, you have all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places with historic and memories are disappeared, "it's like a friend would go away, an acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences" - says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which, 20 years ago, announced Oscar's award and the grand prize of the Cannes Festival to the Tornatoria, tells the story of a small-town movie in Lyria, after a cinema that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, are clearly speaking: for the last five years, 316 traditional film theatres were closed. The biggest loss was recorded in the movies in the major cities: 10 film theatres closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Torino and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-story cinema, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41) among the most affected regions.
And that, for their disappearance, the overturn of multiplexes is not the responsibility of us to prove better than that the highest number of newly opened multi-term movies in Italy in these three regions: the number of rooms in Lombardia, 81 in Toscana and the same number in Emilia-Romagna has risen in the last five years by 195.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally", says the President of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is possible that new facilities are built, but the survival of existing people should also be guaranteed because when a city movie closes, not all those there are willing to go through multiples.
Not to mention the uncharged financial funds for the support of operators: the state’s debt is due to around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is disgraceful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
EUR 16-18 million per year would be needed to maintain the market."
This is the first Italian city that has decided to solve the problem in order to protect and revive the one-stop shops in the city of the suburbs and downtown, through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include the tax incentives granted to operators and the advantages granted to the public to facilitate accessibility: the viewers may park in restricted zones and in certain parking areas with a preferential tariff.
"I like this initiative" - says Giuseppe Tornatore - "and I hope that other cities, even with other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that the traditional movies must improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The protection of the traditional cinema was always an important question to me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the crises that I finally made the Cinema Paradiso, although I've been thinking about it for ten years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale before the locked Rialto or Quirinale, so I can't see the sealed posters from the dust, I'd rather turn my head around.
Fixed lines between politics and 'drangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodell clan in government decisions."
Serious charges were made against the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Directorate, Mayor and Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning in charge of external involvement in the Crime Association.
Bilinc also came to the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the administration, and the same lawyer nephew as the boss, who have been convicted earlier because of participation in a mafia-like criminal cooperative, and paid a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"Absolute legal and moral rules, which are more of a good taste," are written by the state attorneys.
"This would have been the official entrance of the clan to the town hall, which would have given you an additional opportunity to control and control public administration, which is already important.
Agazio Loiero, President of the Calabria region, does not hide that there is "a number of conflicts between local institutions and the organised subworld" in the region: there are areas where the mob spreading is stronger than elsewhere where it will be almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of "andrheta, they are the heroes who remain clean."
This morning's arrests are the continuation of July events, when the police announced that they managed to shut down the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved from their administration. Gioia Tauro Municipal Committee was dissolved once in 1991, even due to the confusions between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor who regains at the time of the breakdown, took the lead of the middle coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried out a cathedral when the Megyeháza ordered the dissolution of the Municipal Committee.
The Minister of Interior referred Marco Minnini to the Court of Justice and accused him of planning everything with a political aim, but the Court explained in the arrest orders signed this morning that he dared to change the A3 project.
The interview with Dal Torriona shows - the state attorneys - that "the demands of a wide-ranging group of entrepreneurs, who are known to be close to the Piromalli family, were to be met by the government's decisions to subordinate the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
It's an incomplete energy source that represents 70 percent of the planet's surface and which is just discovered by the large international energy companies.
Floods, sea floods, floods, and renewable energy for which giants have been blinded by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on.
They've been investigating a hundred years since the possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
About 1980, when the price of oil decreased, the idea of using marine energy was misleaded, but today the need for environmental protection and the again rise in the price of oil will give the sector a new boost.
According to the World Energy Council in London (WEC) in 2007, 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by marine wave facilities.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would be floods and floods.
The giants in the air.
Enersis was the first company that committed itself to maritime energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in Northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It's been two years since, and more and more companies are putting a line on maritime energy, including those who have been committed to this point by traditional energy.
"The Chevron is studying the energy technologies of the oceans and considering the possibility of cooperation with us", stated a spokesperson of one of the American oil company's associates, Wall Street Journal's economic agenda.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the authorisation required for the launch of the Alaska project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
It is not very important, especially if we take into account that the US is continuing to produce oil in Alaska, and that the President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey are also on the way of energy from the sea.
Technologies are waiting for development.
According to experts, it is still an initial technology, even because energy from the sea does not dismantle environmental concerns.
Existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are small, and therefore there is no too much problem with ecosystem.
However, in order to generate more energy, installations with more environmental impact are needed.
There are various options: for example, Ocean Power uses a interconnected buffalo system.
The pushes generated by waves and moving the buoys are converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
Pressure is rolling a turbinate that feeds a generator.
Electricity flows from the underwater cables to the mainland.
At the same time, there are four similar installations in the planning phase, which are only waiting for a federal licence. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
On the other hand, Verdant Power has already started energy production for a shopping centre and a parking lot with six sea turbines located in the East River basin in New York.
During the circumstance, the movement of water rotates the shovels of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
The Verdant stated that he had a long list of partners waiting for permission to use energy only.
It's a rainbow after the bodies.
At present, there is a discrepancies that deserve the potential to be exploited by the flood.
