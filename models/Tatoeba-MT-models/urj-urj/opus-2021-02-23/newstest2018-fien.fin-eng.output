Camille Auer wanted to fix his sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now he's making an art on the subject - "Man should have a right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports from the roof of the project room Academy of Arts.
Every one of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-annual story about how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
You've decided who he is for him.
"I wanted to tell a person about my medical history so that the violence of the process becomes visible," says Auer.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-long study period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with a transmission of diagnostic studies on "sex identity disorder", carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the Internet and was still very long in his own repair process.
He experienced himself as a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the sex can also be legally corrected.
Translax, i.e. the law to strengthen the gender of transsec (563/2002), obliges transsexual people to forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, into the population register centre and passport.
At present, every gender remedies are required for psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is unbearable and insults human rights," says Auer.
Translateral reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight legal remarks and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary decision to oblige the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous government of Finland prepared the change of the law under the leadership of the Minister of Social Affairs and Health at that time, Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns of the Basic came up to the government.
Now the change in law is stuck again.
It is a matter of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The Government does not want to raise it on the table because there are disagreements within the government on the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Managing Director of the Amnesty Finnish Department.
The front of the exhibition space is controlled by two large installations.
One consists of packs and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolary psychologist of the University Hospital in Tampere in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on the basis of these, which should define the treatment of Auer’s law and assistance.
The consciousness of the realm to be examined is exposed to deterioration.
The perception of the subject shows itself in a way that is at border level fragmented and the instability of personality is highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these illustrations.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed mentally ill," says Auer.
Even more shock was when Auer was not given gender remedial treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transponder's waiting hall on TV.
Later on that television, a works of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can increase her breasts, but she needs a diagnosis to remove her breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the number of sex defined in your birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality.
The process of gender correction is more severe for many than for purely medical operations.
Its passages meet dozens of people who need to justify their existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not sufficient," says Auer.
Many of those applying for the process have a psychological symptom: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experience.
As a result, treatment cannot be initiated by the medical staff.
"Abstaining care and assistance can cause a person to get into a worse situation than it was before the start of the process," says Auer.
Auer’s own-specific exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer writes: "I've had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adulthood and that's what people are usually hard to melt."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenage.
Why the wide jaw was not suitable for your own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a fundamental need.
"Our father has to justify so much by speaking, dressing, using voice and movements," he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing being seen, he exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the random comments of the close ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when the loved ones miskind.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they do not agree or be able to inject it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or parts of the body can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long-term research process, no formal confirmation can be obtained for its own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-age applicant shall make a written application for a new ID, telling him that he experiences being the other side of the sex.
After six months of discretion, the applicant shall establish his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland, and the exhibition of Auer is also subject to this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that the art still has the weight and that it can bring about political changes during the time that politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer exhibition in Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The Civil Rights Organization gave a travel warning to Missour.
The National NAACP Organisation for African American Civil Rights has issued a travel warning for Missour, which is due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The travel notice on Missour will enter into force on 28 August 2007 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been numerous unquestionable events based on race", the organization's communication states.
According to NAACP, these factors led to the provision of travel warning.
"The rights of citizens are being violated.
They're being stopped on the basis of the skin colour and being assaulted or murdered", said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missour, to Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard one of the many cases in the same short term."
The travel report on Missouri is the first warning for the state of the United States of America.
The organization mentioned as examples of racist comments against African students at Missour University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questioned circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and the Missouri police arrested him, even though he wasn't charged for a crime.
The travel notice also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Missour that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the travel information is to urge people to be careful and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missour," says Chapel.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by taking the money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, 100 assault crimes were recorded in Missour, namely sixteen most of the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also a response to Missour's new law which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the right of discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU, which recently defended the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently gave travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they adopted immigration laws that force the police to arrest people for immigration violations, and according to the system, this increases the profile of the race.
Generally speaking, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes travel warnings, and they apply to other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Minister of State Ownership Mika Lintilä (Central) has asked Finnair to report on the additional pension payment received by Pekka Vauramo, the CEO of the airline, Yle.
According to the Minister, it conflicts with the state's will.
The additional pension received by Vauramo increased this week by EUR 130 000 when the Helsingin Sanomat news of the performance of the managers of the stock exchange companies.
The Kuvalehti of Finland was news about the additional pension of Vauramo in February.
Finnair told me that he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has indicated that no additional pensions are used for rewarding.
The government owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle of ownership management decision last year.
Immediately, the pressures made up the speech.
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
The United States President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, appeared to be very successful.
Since then, the atmosphere has been dramatically cooled.
New economic sanctions accepted by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reluctantly reacted in Russia.
The most dumb answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev that Trump's signature means a "full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian responses would only be cleared by the political rhetoric and exacerbations, the rigor of the US-Russia after a short period of honeymoon after the choice of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass through the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress, though, accepted the law as a significant consensus, but, according to the President, the adoption of the law was much more difficult.
Trump's criticism is freshly signed by the law to be "significant".
I believe that President Trump's fist was due in particular to Russia, even though the adoption of the law limiting his own powers must have been disgusting.
As well as it is well known, investigations will take place in the United States on Russia's possible interference with the presidential elections, as well as on the connections of the Trump campaign with Russia.
The blackmail between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
Once the White House staff has changed to the steep and the various scandalous translations have become almost up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy does not work in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the president.
Such a situation in no way is hopeful.
If Russia is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to the economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Baltic Sea of the Union is also tightening up relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least on the top of its policy in Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
To a largely traded Member State with Russia such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the United States' recent sanctions are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make the operation of many European companies more difficult.
For example, the impact of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project in Finland and possibly the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project can be felt.
acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of the sanctions, for example, of a significant liquid natural gas in the United States economy.
Commercial seals are a means of demonstrating abusiveness in world policy.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and prudent.
Otherwise, they are more harmful than they are useful.
Isn't anything holy anymore?
Trumpin's White House now has a Freedom statue.
The lack of statues is the most sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqi people, together with the American soldiers, destroyed the statue of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideals of Trump's administration, knew well what he was doing in a vicious debate with Jim Acosta of the CNN channel.
Miller didn't really judge the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by giant flocks of cruise organisers and the characters of the Freedom statue.
His attack was targeted by the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus’ poem was added to the statue — 17 years after the statue was completed.
I saw Miller shouting Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the whole world.
The poem was added later, and it is not part of the original Freedom statue."
Miller wasn't wrong himself, but it's not just history, as he said.
The key are Lazarus touching words, the only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants but the "poorest poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teming shore."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, and he made it clear that "the poorest poorest" are not welcome to Trump's United States.
The importance of the statue of freedom is part of the wider political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue, and they knew well that the act was very political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American Republic with a classic symbol of freedom by female corps.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the Naishahmo is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives himself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
The linking of the poem to the imagination was a brilliant feminist coup and a destructive attack against the American Nationality Goal.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted it to be back original.
Rush Limbaugh, an advocate who can now be regarded as some kind of prediction of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Freedom statue is not to be invited to anyone, but is the early pioneer of the New Conservatives, who takes the United States into the darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty comes up.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
"The whistle doesn't show the way to the United States."
Very rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely from the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted, but hopeful immigrants from the ship’s deck after a long and trial journey.
He saw it from the point of view of protection and people looking for a better life.
His statue of freedom comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their flames do not show the way, but the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
MM competitions 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the British country team.
Neil Black, the performance manager of the UK Athletics Association, says that 16 Scotland members of the World Cup team are "significant confirmation".
The number of Scotland athletes has been selected for the MM competitions that began in London on Friday.
Black says there's something special going on in Scotland, which needs to be learned in Britain.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for as long as we understand what is going on," Black says.
"I attended with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Athletic Union believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
and the UK Athletic Union believes that it is based on their activities.
And the usual streetman thinks he has something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely awesome, which is why it is."
Many Scotland sporters in London are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5 000-foot run. Eilidh Doyle was chosen to be the captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"Workers left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they live and practice.
There was a real feeling and passion for sport in the words of yesterday.
Eilidh Doyle is a 400-foot yard of the National Championship Championship, and these are his fifteenth World Championship, and he believes it's "unbelievable" that the country team has 16 Scotlands.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
In the course of the year, Laura Muir has run five of Britain and two of Europe's records.
He's competing in London at 500 metres and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1500 metres in London. He's also worth keeping an eye on him: a man has an excellent period behind him, including the profits in the UK World Championships and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only Scotland in the country team to add him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the country team says he's "very proud" for involving so many Scotlands, some of which are really competing for the finals and medals.
"Captain access is a great honour, but more special is because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots that got into the country team.
It shows how far we've reached.
They are involved in earned athletes who compete for awards.
My captain's speech?
I think it went fine.
I was focusing on how lucky we are when we got home races.
It is important to enjoy the support of the domestic public and that we are back on the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Prevention of critics on Facebook: Do not stand for a public post if you do not endure criticism
Our country's father knew what's bad for publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but soon the newspapers began to criticize him for all possible domestic policies always in his political principles.
The criticism must have pissed me off.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led to stupid and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That's where we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The American Alliance of Civil Rights challenged Hogan earlier this week.
His staff regard the challenge as unfounded, and the attitude was decreasing also online.
"What does it matter? "It's just Facebook," many comment.
But it matters,
Especially in the Hogan case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the state controlled by the Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to the hot dog.
He has led the state firmly, and he has strictly respected the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published a picture of the sleeve in chemotherapy.
This is why preventing users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintain with tax resources.
Mr. Hogan's reporter, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's activities in his interview with Washington Post, and he said it was just about the moderation of comments.
However, the stamping of commentators as trolleys, sprayers or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with the leaders they chose, not trolles, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and reasonable.
The Reverend quoted the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Advocate Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I complained politely that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken the position of anger crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of the Washington Post.
"I cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same point, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "the centralised attack", and someone else could call them "to promote important things.
During the time of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by preventing the critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, the staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical keys, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It is, in fact, the same thing, just digitally now.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users that prevented President Trump have sued him.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, the Court of Justice of Alexandria, the government of the Loudoun County broke the first addition of the US Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the United States Alliance of Civil Rights went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, cheap mail payments had a similar effect as today on the Internet.
From 1776 to 1800 the number of newspapers was four times the number of newspapers, and anonymous writers twisted Washington.
There were trolleys that time.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in which they called for Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions that criticised Jay's agreement, namely the US-British Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which reflects the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
Real leadership means acceptance of this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about half a few places, and also online reports of three of the couple.
Most of them have become southern and Warsaw Finland, but then individually from Haapavede and Seinäjoki, says Marja Isomursu Evira.
The green peppers are dead in the parasites called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientist named Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the mushrooms, and in particular to the mushrooms.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also seen in the wing birds.
In 2009, it was very good.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a massive collapse in Finland’s green pepper stock, after which the stocks of the species have been recovering.
There have been sick green peppers now, but at least not in the large scale yet, says Juha Honkala, the museum master of the University of Helsinki’s Natural Science Museum (Loomus).
It is fearful that the previous epidemic of green peppers will be regenerated again unless you do anything.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop the summer meal of birds immediately.
I'll add to the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty wishes to benefit from homefielding at the Renaissance Club
Former First Player in Europe, Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from homefielding for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East London organises 25th Scotland Senior Open tournament.
The Northern Irish Rafferty led a tournament in the neighborhood of Archerfield Links field last year before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased to be a new place and is an ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be able to complete its glory," says Rafferty.
"The players will see the field at their best, and it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a game enthusiastic ambassador, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great demonstration conference for this field."
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won his 32-year career for both the European tour and the European challenger tour.
"This feels really a special opportunity," says a player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr will return to real action on his own soil, and he went to the tour with him after having completed 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Gaying in the homeside is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The Trinity will be followed by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major tournament winners of Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament takes place in six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All revenues are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organisation.
There were potential indoor problems in the barracks.
In the bag, there have been no problems with indoor air in the archipelago building of the Pori Brigadier's message comppanie, which was reported on Thursday, at least so far.
Inner air investigations will continue.
The reports began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health was weakened because of the poor inner air at the archipelago.
According to Lieutenant General Mika Holman, Brigadier General of Porn, there have been no problems in the health situation of other armies.
It turns out that this was a case of individuality, and the other members of that unit have not had any health problems.
Each announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clear this issue thoroughly.
At present, it is not known that we have no internal air problem, says Holma.
The Brigadier Communication says that due to the entry part of July, goods must have been transferred to the archipelago, which may have resulted in a momentary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed congestive, says Holma.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's goldland
Bardina Degei doesn't use the flavor of his cooking.
He's only rarely using a cathode.
Degei lives in the wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the province of Papua, in Indonesia. When he makes dinner, he usually puts the battal – locally "nota" – directly into his fire.
After half an hour, the burnt batt burned on the carrot will be graciously eaten with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture, he sits on a muddy painter, where he usually carries out his daily ponds, such as in the same water that washes from the closest sofa.
The vault's office is to be delivered in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of four wives of his husband, and he is not ordered to take care of the fields.
Multi-marriedness is common here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after five nights," Degei tells.
This is a rare throat in the Arctic Papua, in the former Dutch colonial colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969, before the controversial referendum, where 1 026 villages were forced to vote publicly before the occupational forces.
The local independence movement opposed the Dutch authority quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta Government, which strictly manages the region and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003 the province was officially distributed to Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a peripheral and a collision. The journey starts on a flight of a half an hour from the province capital of Jayapura to Naabire and continues with a belly-wrapped five-hour drive along the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
There are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo stores surrounded by some 19 000 inhabitants in the city, with rusted wavelets dyed as watch browns.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, the nations of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. He means the colorful, hand-wovened heads, dark skirt and bright-coloured blouse.
"Before we only had leaves as a cover of our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty limit, and child mortality and literacy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also the goldland of Indonesia.
Pania is a top area of about 153 000 inhabitants in the size of New Jersey. Only about 100 miles from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by the Freeport McMoran company, which is located in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mining generated gold and copper worth $1 billion for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has estimated 78 billion timber reserves.
To the Papua, however, these riches bring misery because they mean the repressive presence of the strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, New York Times revealed that Freeport paid to local military personnel and military local units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004.
This source of income is threatened by the demands of Papua for a greater sovereignty, and they are being silenced with mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 beans and raped, tortured and captured thousands.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, mass deaths in the Papua tribes in the 1970s resulted in genocide dimensions.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3 900 people in the area of peaceful demonstrations.
We Will Lose Everything from 2016, in the Brisbane Architect Report, is reports of the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular means — and unsatisfactory attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The calculation of the number of victims is difficult because there are cases per week," says the Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch, Andreas Harsono.
Rubbers have been blackmailed when the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provins are Christians, but the population structure is changing when the populations in Indonesia move the region from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes to move the Muslims in the hope of better living.
Japanese warung food stores sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mixtures in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Others have started selling chickens and vegetables at the marketplace cheaper than locals", says Abeth You, a 24-year-old, who is from Pania and moved to the province capital after work.
"Local women lost their client."
In Indonesia, President Joko Widodo – his nickname Jokowi – promised in his 2014 electoral campaign to address the injustices and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on its way to the President's Castle of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel deceived.
"We broke our hearts because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to meet our wishes and restore justice," You says.
In Pania there was some kind of wave base only two months after the lobby posts of Jokow.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers they should use the headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remark, and the local pastor Yavedt Tebai said that the man came back with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured the children and abused them with rifle tips.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the National Electoral Board near the scene was lit on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand beans — young men and women and children — gathered in the football field before the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting springs for feasts, and they began to present a traditional waita dance in the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in the circle and tracked the bird song.
Some demonstrators began to rock the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed up, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If there are more than three people to resist, shoot them dead." The information is based on a formal document seen in the TIME magazine that has not been published for local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto region, found the situation out of the hands and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot at the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house that was painted brightly.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' rows.
"In the Peninsula, several shots were shot."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes TIME, sadly, and like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police were just protecting the police station because it was targeted by the attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiy, the Papua police reporter.
"That's when it's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The information about deaths came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave Jayapura a sensitive speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence of Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing will ever happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the justice system.
But he started to cancel his speeches right away.
"The majority of the infringements took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but we need certain processes to do so," he said.
In the interview of the TIME magazine in Jakarta, June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The United Nations blames Wiranto for "crime against humanity." The crimes relate to more than a thousand people's deaths in the Itä-Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto said to the TIME magazine that 11 cases have already been investigated in Papua's human rights violations, including Pania's events.
The families of the victims of Paniah are very unbelievable to the arguments.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us he still lives in fear, even though it's been years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the panics are afraid to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had assaulted him after he had helped me bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after burying the victims," he says.
The shootings aren't over.
Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take a man who lost his mind to the hospital, including children amongst the injured persons.
The husband needed medical care was Ravianus Douw, 24 years old, who had been caught in water fishing on a nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
According to local authorities, however, the mobile police unit in Indonesia opened fire for the crowd, when a villager was killed.
"We are terrified. We fear revenge," says Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and sees when the wounded were brought to the treatment.
"I've been hiding home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has demanded that gunshot cops be held responsible and that a mobile police unit be withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been the problem of the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds on dissatisfaction in the Mee, Multi, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the Papua collars.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Beans with random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by imprisoning and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "lovers, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds unhappy.
In Enarotal there is only a small amount of rice to be sold, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Just like a sandwich.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batates and some fruits and vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman can be responsible for four or five battalions.
Most of the crops are for the family, and the rest is sold at the marketplace.
Ten battalions cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
As a result, the differences in local and migrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and usually go locally to better trained and more wealthy immigrants.
Only a few beans have enough capital and skills to run their own company competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai tribal council.
The remote Papua will be ignored in the world.
Furthermore, international innovation is still subject to strict restrictions.
Previously on this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been given a rare description permit.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kinen, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing the limits of the news.
"Indonesia's unrest provinces from the eastern Papua and the newsletter of the Western Papua have new risks: visa waiver and black listing", Kine stated in his opinion.
The lack of liberty of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only pressured by the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "high and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Pania shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
The reporter of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir contested the accusations and told the journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want foreign governments to be involved.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke silence and expressed their desire for freedom, the anonymous source of the meeting.
In Indonesia, there are presidential elections in 2019, but the papula say that Jokowi is no longer likely to be voted.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are confused in the Pania shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the panics: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in shortages and poverty, practically without health services and training opportunities.
According to Gobai, the panics, like the others, keep the votes they gave to Jokow as a debt that must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and fears, the victims of the Panian shooting attack once more symbolically responded: they buried one of the victims in the police station and the military station to the opposite country.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not allow the responsible to forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," says Yacobus in the head.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora is barking for retreatment of Robert Helenius: "Even the fans of theirs don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran of heavy boxers were to fight on May 27 in Hartwall.
However, the fight was canceled for commercial reasons.
Chisora will bend the reason for floating the retreat to Helenius' shoulders during the recent interview with the IFL TV.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my opponent in Finland.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's rude.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall region in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the regaining match went smoothly, and its promotor, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanoms in May, that the match was transferred to the autumn.
The fight hasn't heard anything new since then.
However, retreat is no longer a problem with Chisora.
The fight would probably have been canceled in any case after Chisora was sick.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up with a lot of pain.
My tyre was exploding.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's in a 45-percent state right now.
He's not interested in regaining with Helenius, but he's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered the loss of Whyte in December by a scattering voice.
It came to you to repeat the Torch cloud drawer in Dubai.
The flames took over the world’s highest counting residential building in Dubai on Friday. hundreds of inhabitants were forced to escape from a 79-story building of 337 meters.
This was already another fire within two years in the building, the name of which happens to be Torch, the flint.
The building was empty, and no one knows it was hurt, and the cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the event.
"We were sleeping and we woke up the fire alarm in the voice and the crying of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," told Reuters the resident named George.
According to the rescue authorities in Dubai, the shuttle forces had the fire shut down at four o'clock in the morning and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case can raise further questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings across the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Management Board of the Torch building conducted a study that found that the most damaged discs used for fatty coverage and isolation were affected.
In the UK, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower's isolation and umbrella plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.
A moped was stolen from the riverside parking lot during the night
From the Joensuel parking lot, the moped was stolen between Tuesday at 21 p.m. and Wednesday at 5 p.m.
Mopo disappeared from the Ninevarian address of Tikamäentie 2.
The Mopo was a sign of Sky Team Monkey.
The colour is red and the registration number is 27-REV.
We found Mopo later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air travellers take in prohibited objects, reveal a survey
The survey of air travellers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited objects consciously or unawarely to aeroplanes by the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least 6% of passengers had knifes or other steel-fired objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent of them said they were only after finding out that they were in a mistake transporting weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey responded to more than a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, which also reveals that young passengers are more likely to undermine the rules.
19,7 per cent of the passengers who were aware of the TSA's rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and fluids to the plane.
More than three per cent admitted that he had taken steel items consciously to the aeroplane, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that he had taken the prohibited medicinal products consciously to the aeroplane.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The survey carried out by the company wanted to find out how many of the smugglers had accidentally passed the security inspection and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to pass smuggling goods — consciously or without knowing.
However, as the company who made the survey states, the TSA's instructions are very complex and confusing.
Travellers often do not know what liquids to take on the plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA confiscations are liquids.
For some time, there was also a feeling that books should not be taken into the plane.
You can take the liquids to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, retired his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to justice, Pruitt revoked its previous decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken during the administrative period of Obama to reduce emissions.
According to Pruitti, the change shows that the Agency, which he has led, takes better account of the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
Mr Pruitt did not even mention a complaint against his previous decision at the Federal Appeal Court.
The States should start to comply with the 2015 demand level for soil ozone from 1.10.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would forward the implementation of the decisions a year in order to allow his agency to have more time to learn about the plan, because "the Agency does not want to intervene in local decision-making or to impede economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of Oklahoma's state before President Donald Trump appointed him to be the head of the EPA, and Pruitt is known as opposing more stringent environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions against chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change in the Wednesday's mind is the last retaliation of the Pruit plan to alleviate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision that the EPA Director exceeded his mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the decision of the Obama administration of oil and gas companies, which obliges companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In the opinion of the Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his full translation of ozone rules only strengthens the cooperation of the EPA with the state in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the past administrations, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected the activist groups and others to challenge it to the right to reach an agreement on timetables," said Pruitt.
"We do not believe in regulation through trial and we take time seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us."
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use "the power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that "the provisions are justified and based on the best available information".
In the Congress, the Republicans are driving a wider change in the ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the general prosecutor of the New York State, led by the EPA's confederation to the trial this week, said that the group intends to continue the pressure.
"The change in the sense of the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6,7 million newyorkians and more than 115 million Americans exposed to direct impacts of smoke smoke in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the action included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
It can cause severe breathing difficulties for susceptible human groups, and it is also part of thousands of premature deaths annually.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors welcomed the unexpected change in direction of Pruit.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the man responsible for our breathing use sound sense," says Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We still have to fight Trump's administration, because its ideological aim is to act under the conditions of contaminants and other groups that serve their own interests."
The supercar manufacturer's street steering steering machine, "the Ferrar's style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens with Ferrar's style, President Sergio Marchionne said the plans for the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, the Automotive News news.
All East Savo abdominal diseases of the same type of virus
Infection of the coastal swamp is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, announces THL.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory for Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth infection of East Savo is the same as the previous virus strain.
THL has ensured that on Friday, 28 July, a person on the beach has confirmed that a butterfly infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections in East Savo are linked to the first scumbag found in June in the region.
The news is good, because it means that we have not revealed any other butcher virus types.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth of the disease can be identified until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Mrkaleena Erkkilä, the primary health care doctor of Soster.
No new abstract infections or doubts have occurred since the fifth case was confirmed.
However, it is still important that everyone ensures the update of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds us.
Add to the subject: In Pirkanmaa, three new ash diseases were confirmed - "Increase infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for the making of a permitting cliff
Pontica's soup wasn't even considered legal.
Based on the basis that the process produces methanol alongside the liquor, which is poisonous.
Preparing a cliff at home is legal next year, but the legalisation of the squid's soup is not even considered.
Skills are made by fermentation, squid again by distilling.
There is a basis for the regulation of distillation that the process, along with the wine, produces a methanol that is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the shoe of cliché for every man's right, government counsellor Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of chulic was not considered legal.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Mr Outi Mäkelä (Kok.).
He is a group of parliamentary groups of government parties who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
Promise to distillate the dock at home can not be granted even at the request in the future.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importing shows that homemade preparation of alcoholic beverages is a simple rule: alcohol can be manufactured at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to a beer, a cider and a wine at home, you can make even screams legally.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavouring and flavouring substances and enables the spark production, Mäkelä to specify.
Production must still be done so that the flavouring and flavouring materials produced in the course of fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be made to themselves as much as you want, and self - deciding alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on sale.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
Alcohol law is now under scrutiny by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come to the hearing of the Parliament as soon as the semester begins.
The plenary session is on 5 September.
The Act shall enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the Embassy has already taken a position, and Mäkelä is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius was thrown to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was banished to the South African hospital because of suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius's already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
On the other hand, the reporter of the Pistorius family told me that the former best athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned a six-fold paralympic gold medal for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkampi.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
Literated phone discussions reveal that Trump has pushed Mexico to build a border wall
The littering of telephone discussions between the President of the United States Donald Trump and the directors of Mexico and Australia has been leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump invited the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public talks about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto on the fact that this had knocked out the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promiseing to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a distillation on Trump's first call to Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia would be "smart", "smart" and "smart", which Trump said, "the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like a "idioot" because he had proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped calling Turnbull, saying, "This was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia's bloodshed: The Activists recast racist drowning in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia and continues on its way towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the team, the middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath of his cigar and trims through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" man's groaning.
Get out of the car!
The screams break the silence when a young blackman is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a relaunch that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the pressures of irritation are real when the hanging eye is put on the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-design the events of 1946. Then Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although the killers are living among us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in redischarging arrangements.
"It's a shame of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
To him, relaunching is an astonishing invitation to act, and it also reminds Monroe's people that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the defendants to be brought to trial, and we want to finally end things, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't heal and reconciliate until we have justice."
Death investigator covers the body of the victim who died in the murder of Georgia on 27 July.
According to the FBI records of the NBC's news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of the lynch.
But no one was accused of murder.
Even though the responsible have been free for decades, the activists say that the motives of the lynking have been locally known all the time: politics and sex.
In 1946, black men in the state of Georgia were given the Supreme Court’s decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections; the Supreme Court adopted its decision in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the elections there was an incident where a black tenant farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city reported that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI, a powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid the $600 guarantees of Malcom, against which he was released from prison, 25.7.1946.
On the way home, along with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford's bridge.
"It's turned out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities; the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is more prominent than that.
"It was a right to vote," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been in control of the redischarge of the Georgian slaughter for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and imprisonable, a description of shocking racism, which many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It is difficult to look at the presentation, but it is even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because we have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – met to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh works as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the recast for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," says Marbaugh.
"It is important, however, that this side of history should be kept up so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room, they train Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins on a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? "I said get out of my mail, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, will answer.
Then there's a hit.
And then everyone (maybe all black actors) chews into laughter.
Greene's laughing the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally get too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene's waking.
"I just don't think the whites used the word "---u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room has the power of a friend's life.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are sober.
No one's laughing.
Relaunch will end quickly and violently.
Crying, shooting — and silence.
A woman dressed for a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few ten metres away, 50 viewers wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple who's come to see the show from Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have been guided by Brooks by the graves of the victims in the pressureful humidity of Georgia.
The murders have changed from the story to the truth.
After the show, Greene will invite the crowd to check the bodies.
The children crawl to watch artificial blood and unmotivated bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy's mad like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actors who act as the liars take off their dresses and wipe tears.
Bradshaw's hugging Marbaugh, a man who was presenting the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actresses and then bursts in tears after a tough show.
"No worries", the woman involved in the show will comfort you.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet together for dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta is very busy discussing the presentation with the black couple that he has just met.
It's hard for Denise Duplins to find words when he describes the feelings of the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and to watch terrible acts that they say and do people who look like you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that the lynches are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"Relaunch is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a teaching experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Riding crops in stores is flourishing: This much by removing "supplied parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove the flower cabbage leaves in the store before weighing?
And take the big hat out of the pineapple, isn't it?
The answers are strongly shared by opinions: it is an indication of the extremity that has been carried out, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used and which, however, go to the trash at home.
They'll identify the phenomenon in the stores.
For example, there are paper boxes in the K-Citymarket Department of the City of Helsinki Ruoholah, as many of them, for example, rip off the sections of the flower cabbage.
From the box, leaves are exported to biowaste.
According to the news published by the household novels, sleeping with a vegetable skull surprises traders.
But how much does the removal of extra parts of vegetables really save money before weighing?
How important is it really about sleeping?
We women tested how the price changes when the pineapple, latva artichokes, delicious mushrooms, broccoli and flower cabbage take the leaves or stocks off.
Flower cabbage: EUR 1.80 became the price of a flower cabbage of EUR 2.10 when it shelled all the leaves away.
Ananas: A total pineapple price of EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position was twisted.
Latva artichokes: EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Two delicious feathers cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without 80 cents.
Conclusion: If the leaves and the stocks go off, it saves a few inches at best for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
Thus, these purchases would have saved EUR 1.20 in total!
Neymar was bought out in Barcelona - a brassist star concluded a five-year agreement with the PSG
Neymar of Brazil has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the FC Barcelona to buy out EUR 222 million in the Spanish League.
The total transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer cost EUR 105 million of the French Paul Pogba.
Spain’s league braked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the league rules, the company that buys can not pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player itself must buy out his contract, which will happen by recycleing money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the League to Barcelona.
They believe Neymar will arrive in Paris on Friday.
He is likely to be introduced to the new public at the opening of the PSG period against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also informed the European Football Union Uefa that it would provide information on the payment, so that the Union could determine any disciplinary measures arising from the case.
Among other things, President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas is suspected of breaking the rules of Uefa's economic fair game with the use of the PSG.
Uefa may be punished by a company that will make more than EUR 30 million losses over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economic swings.
The transfer of Neymar to the PSG will affect the society's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players at considerable sums, Uefa was informed.
The PSG is owned by a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.

Austin Dunn had been working on a plane in the southwest-floridan international airport with a couple of colleagues, suddenly, when lightning hit the plane from the rain sky.
The force of the lightning threw the plane to the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had three-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and told me that the brother got an electric hit and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, says Austin's sister, Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
Experience was tough for the whole family.
That's not the kind of thing to expect.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells us.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the case and the transport operation itself decides whether it would comply.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revitalises business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British Education Group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting the new structural programme as a response to the pressure on its business.
According to Managing Director John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4 000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again with 300 million pounds in May as part of its third savings programme aimed at reviving the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
In the last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House costume to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that the current year's perspective was the same, and its turnover grew by a percentage in the first half of the year and was GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack to the escort in Kabul: The NATO soldier died in a suicide attack.
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, according to the officials, he was killed by a NATO soldier and several others were injured.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers were injured and interpreted.
According to unauthorised local information, three civilians also died in the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in the bombing of the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's opinion, Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by a "personal explosion device" carried by the person.
The opinion reported that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the US Military Hospital at the airport of Bagram.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for the NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in a region that mainly lives in Shiamus.
The Taliban announced that he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the center of Kabul in a bombing, which was the most devastating attack of the militant group in the country after the United States' troops invaded the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send further forces to assist the local army and the police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA urges its decision to postpone the implementation of the Smoking Provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has revoked its decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken in the administrative period of Obama to reduce smoke-related emissions on the day after 15 states had challenged the Agency's right.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 late Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states," said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of Ozone Detections by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, the rate of smoke is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution is to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 state governed primarily by the Democrats, including the District of Columbia, which said that the deferral of implementation was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has sought ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, are part of a broader economic growth programme.
The drumm measures have been countered by democrats and environmental defenders who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing of ozone-containing air "may weaken your lung function and increase your breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to Daddy's leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects say the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company stopped before the security check.
The police don't tell me more why the company was interrupting.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-sparing device and to take the device to a public location, such as a public means of transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in the police patrols on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
Managing Director of liquids: Renewable fuels were well managed
The result of the oil processor Neste before the taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievose, the company achieved good results in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products increased to the record level and the evolution of the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable profits were improved by the United States Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievosa, the profits of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, although the tax relief has ended.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we have already announced strategic investment in 2017, said Lievonen in the release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision course for the nearest fight of the nearest future of the 63.7 kilograms, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in the ESPN Sports Channel offices in Los Angeles until the WBC's unbeatable light series master Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatšenko, the master of the WBO's top feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won on Showtime with the unanimous decision of the former four-grade world champions, Adrien Broner, and afterwards, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the best of five of the different weight classes boxers on the comparative list.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, "How you doing, Master?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday.
When the twin posed to photographers, Lomatšenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the fight between men would be "perfect for the bigs".
"I'm a former feathersman," reminded Garcia.
"I moved up the series for Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63,5 pounds.
I want to go back to the light show.
He has to get up into a light series [61.2 pounds], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomatšenko agreed.
"Bangling needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of the strategy that Lomatšenko debytoed in the light series later this year and fights against Garcia next summer (37-0.30 wins). Garcia would be interested in meeting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell are fighting in the light series in Forum on 23 September.
"The game could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," said Garcia and later announced that he was ready to take a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We're the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get to the deal."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatšenko as an unbelievable fighter, and maybe he was going to go see the Saturday match.
Lomatšenko interrupted Garcia's compliment and said that this three-grade master from Riverside looked like "true slow."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the impact force and then boxing.
Men said they felt that the fight between them would be more and more effective.
"This is the game we're expecting.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," said Garcia.
Lomatšenko said he was waiting for him to fight the best.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Mean salary of EUR 5 300, training of what happens - the situation of investment counselling has been "wow and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Last, the Sanomats of Helsinki told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment counselor talked about a full puppet when selling investment products.
Investment advisers and rules for the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
These failures are based on a new Financial Market Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the knowledge requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 examination.
The financial sector has been authorising the organisation of qualifications for APV investment studies for a company called Oy, whose group of qualifications is both Finance Control (Fiva), universities and industry experts.
The degrees are 12-15 degrees, and their exams are drawn up by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "very wide in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Studies, reports that the percentage of exams is roughly estimated to be about 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, mostly all investment services have been carried out either by APV1 or APV2 because they are subject to the rules of the companies.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning their names, whose staff seem to have maped the performance of qualifications, Savikko says.
He says there are some bankers like this.
According to the clay, APV1 has completed a study of 13 000 to 14 000 people since 2000 and the APV2 qualifications recommended for more demanding investment advisers have been carried out by around 3 000 persons.
Some banking companies consider the qualification to be an advantage.
More than one industry has much more stringent knowledge requirements.
The Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires APV qualifications to be carried out, as the knowledge of the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisers make a number of thousands of euros per month, including natural and income premiums.
The average amount of regular working hours of monthly wages is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work on the mission make over €5.900 a month and women over €4.500 a year.
On average, the tenth of the most earners deserves about EUR 8 100.
The tenth of the most earning men earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, the tenth of the most earning women earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment counselling under the Investment Service Act can only be provided by a licensing company.
Worker and task level has so far been trusted in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it was subject to individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor's activities.
In principle, it can also be used as a vendor of investment products, even if skills and qualifications are at a high level.
Basically, in this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
More than one industry has significantly more stringent knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to the clay, the new Financial Market Directive (MiFID II) will result in tightening from the beginning of the next year.
It requires each company to be responsible for the adequate competence of staff providing investment services.
Financial control, in turn, should be empowered to determine what to be able to do.
Marko Hovi, market surveillance officer of Fiva, reports that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the legislation on the skills and experience requirements of investors and investment products sellers.
According to the court, the new requirements concern both the personal staff of investment firms and the related agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
The court tells us that according to the presentation by the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is entitled to order knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided in these sights during the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to ensure the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and supplementary training.
This is all to be documented, and the company has this obligation of proof that this has also been done.
The court clarifies that, for example, in practice, the company has to map the personnel's activities at individual level.
This will certainly come from different levels of demand, depending on whether investment advice or sales of products are involved.
According to the court, there is also a need to work with someone more experienced in time if the knowledge or experience is not at sufficient level.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the courts, the rules will be tightened and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra’s sinister beach swimming schoolers will not take moments to rain or sunshine - Iines Kaiknen polski with the help of the bathing village
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra Beach Swimming Schools roamed in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though sometimes a hundred and then again frying, young swimmers are not in moksis, praises the swimming school driver of Taina Itkonen.
This week's bathing schools have a total of 13 children, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the next week was influenced by the fact that school and escorts are already starting, assessing Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in collaboration with the Urban to combine the project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liette's swimming beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and the young swimming schools trained to stay on the surface with bathing tubs, someone already without.
Smaller sisters also enjoyed water.
Iines of Kaik, 5, first thought deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to pollute towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that she's been in a lot of swimming this summer.
He's good at the lime beach.
Like Iines Kaiksen, the swimming pool was trained hard to swim, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with the achievements of this day, the swimming school praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, and sometimes wanted to go to the water wars.
Ilona Villberg, followed by his daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swims from the beach, holds the beach swimming school as a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather's been what's happened, Anna's always liked to go here every day.
We had to get warmed up.
Swimming schoolers packed up on the docks.
The boys had enough to deal with the frog found on the beach.
Million Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the docks the towels, hung fruits, and baked the day.
In the water, the education continued, but there was no rush on the docks.
It's like you don't belong in the summer.
The unidentified soldier sells toilet practitioners, "This is such a merging story."
You see all the kinds of things you see.
The cleaning products manufactured by the Blue Product fell into the Unknown Military Products series a few days ago.
So dishwashers and washings, and wc brush on the edge brush.
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of a movie in the autumn.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products are scratched in social media: When will the unknown health ties come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Blue Product Deputy Managing Director Aino Määtä say?
We're a film partner.
We're in support of this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted support for domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products become a special show for movements, and thus the film gets visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this often when you think that the products and the related stories would have something in common?
Yes, this is a merging story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish fundamental values as those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to an army culture, Määttä notes.
Other partners in an unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichy has been introduced to the market, which is found in the names of Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already recording the Finnish Photo Journal's blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the movie's first night, so there's still time to go.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, by Valio, the processor, the Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen.
New results of the age tests of Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical age tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published, and the results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined are more than 18 years old, but not all of them consider the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Legal Medicine Agency started the test earlier this year.
Tests can be carried out to further assess the age of the asylum seeker, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised that it had failed to determine the real age of applicants claiming to be minor.
To date, the Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests, and the results of 2 481 tests have now been published by the Legal Medicines Agency. The tests were conducted between the mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
The 80% of the tested asylum seekers were determined to be more than 18 years of age, and the judiciary also identified 25 cases that the test should be "maybe 18 years of age or older".
In the 432 cases, the end result was that the applicant for asylum is "possibly less than 18 years old".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age reported by the applicant.
The Johan Göransson Agency for Legal Medicine reports that the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent. Large differences in the statistics of the previous months are not visible," she told the Local magazine.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied their age.
In May, the Agency announced 581 results of the test and announced that 442 had "references that the study should be 18 years old or older".
When the same results were examined by Svenska Dagbladet, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that it was 18 years this year.
The method of assessing the medical age used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the kneebirds, and then the dental doctors and radiologists analyse the images, and the method is also criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Karolinian Institute, Claude Marcus, whose job is to assess human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right thing to do.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure to determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicines Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is commonly possible to say that the risk of determining the child as a adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test will soon be completed for 18 years, and the risk will be about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland.
In the third round, Mikko Ilos spent Article 30 on the resulting slot downwards the European round of golf in Scotland.
Ilonen left place 11 on Saturday, but it was found at the end of the round to share the place 41.
One double bogi was gathered with three bogs in a difficult coil.
The others had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to share the top position with one under the par round, even though he said that there was enough work in the lengths of the umbrella.
Keli was crude, but I hanged with him, and finally the day was good, Poulter twisted.
He's sharing his top seat with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Western Virginia Governor will change the party
On Thursday night, the Western Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced the Trump campaign to change the party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," said Justice.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and thorough reflection, I will tell the Western Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out on the brutal applause.
"To be a member of the Republican party registered tomorrow," the Justice added.
As a warden, I would tell you it's time for a new game.
Trump promised earlier that the Western Virginia campaign event would make a significant announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support the democratic candidates of Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) published a statement that "Council Governor Justice's Party Exchange is another attack on a democratic party which is more likely to build obstacles than better America".
"Democrates only have 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Justice Declaration is the last retaliation of a party with no leadership and cannot find a positive message," said RNC representative Ronna McDaniel in his opinion on CBS's news.
Lightning sows damage - Thursday coming up to the summer very thunder day
In the end of the week, more thunders are also available to South Finland.
During the last week, in particular in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the region of Warsaw.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the lightning attacks lit several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a very thunder day of the summer so far.
Finland has finally been found by the puberty cucumbers.
During the last week, lightning has been especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the area of Warsaw Finland.
By the table lightning hit the line house's electrical center, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report on the fire about 15 minutes until midnight on Wednesday.
The electrical center was located in the sauna room at the end of the line house.
The rescue plant had a bottle of roof and walls to find firefights and turned off the fire vigorously.
A total of eleven apartments were free of electricity, but they avoided personal injury.
On the leave, the lightning fired the outer building into phenomena in Harjuland before midnight.
When the rescue plant arrived, the building was already at the full fire stage, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
An outer building of about 50 square meters burned to the ground.
On the road of Kuopio in the Pennsylvania, the lightning hit the home house again.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a floating lightning attack.
The rescue department came to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire early, but only a few melts went down.
In transport, the thunder caused problems between the Seine River and Vaasa, when the lightning damaged the traffic control system.
The error was obtained between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be corrected shortly before five afternoons.
In the meantime, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with a flooded section of the thunder.
Lightning has sown destruction across Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively small this summer.
This summer's thundershots have been quite absurd! estimates the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, a specialist at the Air Science Faculty.
Wednesday and Thursday’s thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in their strength, but thanks to the little lightning of the summer, it feels even strong.
This could feel really thin, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's thunders, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landscapes raided 1 700 times, and Thursday has had potential even to the toughest thunder day of the summer: about 16 p.m. there were 1,790 landscapes in the plakkari.
If the lightning continues at the beginning of the night, it can be achieved by more than two thousand lightning, Importine predicts.
The previous record weakness was the thunder year in 2015, when the annual lightning was about 30 000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning had increased 18 386 to lightning.
So there is still something to be attached to, so that this year does not break the "record" for two years.
However, you can expect the crawler to continue.
According to the import, the air mass in Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is an acceptable environment for thunders.
The main focus of the slopes will be on Saturday from north to south of the country, where some 2,000 lightning days can be received both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central part of the country is allowed to have a more uniform saddle.
According to Tuovis, there's only a few thundershots.
Coe praises Russia's "open" apology for the doping scandal
The world's sports leader Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded because of the dopingskandaal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to terminate the Russian ban of participation.
The Russian general sports director, Dmitri Shljahtin, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday at the MM races, that Russia's ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight firmly against the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all those athletes who were taken from the races of gold or silver."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban, and Russia was excluded from general sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Office WADA's report presented evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
"I thought his answer was very straight today, it was a very open-minded presentation," said Coe, President of the IAAF, to the journalists.
"The entire Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletic Union admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced to do everything in order to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said that he was 'happy' to accept the conditions for terminating the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has taken place, but the Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the right time to terminate the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with a neutral athlete in London at the MM competitions starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before it can be restored.
"The test remains inadequate, and the coaches who have been banned will continue to work freely," she told the suppliers on Friday, after the IAAF Council's presentation in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If you're honest, I'm disappointed to admit that the film was produced by the CEO of Helsinki Film Annika Sucksdorff Yle during the interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish cinema audience might be conservative, and it appears that it is.
The movie received its premiere in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a small number of 100 000 viewers, which is the budget of the film, to about five million euros.
This has become no lottery profit, but now it is important that the investors get theirs back.
If the film had succeeded better in homeland, they'd have already gotten their money.
Now we've got to wait for some bites of extraterrestrial distribution, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film guided by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football coupons do not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive transfer of players in football all the time.
On its possible penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), the European football regulator UEFA will decide to prevent teams from participating in the respected Masters' League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced a fair game's financial rules, according to which the PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the closure of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary is moving in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty paying the amount of Neymar's transfer and attaching him to his Stargate, as it follows the financing of the Qatari oil-riched ruler's family.
Companies may use large sums for buying players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not profitable.
The economic rules for a fair game were drawn up at the initiative of the French Michel Platin, who was elected to chair the UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the success sought by the debtor was cheating and led to serious problems if the banks or owners pulled their backs.
In 2011, the focus of fair game's financial rules was on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that for the first time in Chelsea, Roman Abramovich, the implementation of the business model was significantly difficult. Abramovich purchased a promising team, used huge sums for players and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period for fair game rules will be up to 2018. During this period, the associations will be allowed to make up to 30 million euros of losses.
Even though Platini had to leave the UEFA President’s duties in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cefer also wants to control the unreasonable use of the clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in place, and we will also apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, responsible for the economic rules of the fair game in UEFA, told the Associationd Press News Office last week.
While the PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a single remuneration, it may defer the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded in EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
Based on fair game economic rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab to Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and it was also ordered to limit its 21 players in the Championship of the Championship for the period 2014-2015 instead of the 25 ordinary players.
UEFA monitors the series that may try to circumvent its economic rules by increasing its income through companies associated with the association owners.
For example, if the Qatari company supports the PSG but the value of the aid is deemed to be higher than the normal level of the market, the UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s support for the PSG was exceeded.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar’s benefits in the PSG could be financed by payments available from Qatar’s 2022 football competition organising committee.
However, the PSG and the Arrangement Committee have prohibited Neymar from making an ambassador of MM competitions, which would be very easy to reveal.
Due to the previous sanctions of the PSG, UEFA tends to follow firms more closely to circumvent rules.
On Thursday, the sources on the situation reported that UEFA has not negotiated with the PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on the condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the power to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest public accounts, the turnover of the PSG during the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542,4 million and the operating profit was more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements of the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of follow-up products and game shirts.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % by means of the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated from the world's best player's departure, tried to make Neymar's move difficult, allegedly breaking the financial rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the association and the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish AS-sanoma magazine, which he referred to the Qatarian ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also reservations about the state's financing of the football club's activities.
"The habit is the result of the ownership that has changed the football operating environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
The respect of the economic rules of the fair game will be very difficult. There are so many interests that are linked to the representation of the state of the famous player."
Now we're in a hurry: Coach of Finnish MM-sporters stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahde and three-looker Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train athletic sport in MM races in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without his coach’s advice.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the length of the jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple ridge.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter in the UK ambassador without any results.
The coach has a call from the MM race organisers as a documentary, but it has not been appropriate to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kempainen said.
He has always handled visas successfully before, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone looks at the stadium, the stadium pointed the marks, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach was out of the way.
MM-medal for Finland for London requires a miracle
The MM competitions of general athletics start in London today on Friday and last on Sunday, August 13th, at the end of a fair week.
General sports, skiing and hockey are the species to which Finnish bench sportsmen can take passionately year after year, whether successful or not.
In the hearts of bench sporters, the success is measured in the medals.
Of course there are other gauges.
Less attention will be given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the ranking races, in which experience gains the capacity of athlete to the level that adult MM medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no young athletes in the small MM team in Finland, although there are no conkareita.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interestingness and surprise of sports are the fact that wonders can happen.
It draws the bench sportsmen to the television screen and glues the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the breakdown of time until late in the evening.
From the previous MM competitions in general sport 2015 Finland received one bronze mital.
It was brought by the spear thrower, Tero Longmäki.
The dareful ones are waiting for the Medal of Long Mountain now, even though the results of his and other throwers' recent times and the staying of Long Mountain in the rankings last summer.
Whatever happened to these races, longmäki will remain in history as a large Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish sportsmen in the races or making a personal record is a good enough performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt of the coming years of Finland’s general sport will provide a good success in international youth races this summer too.
The development of young talents and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining the elite force of small representation sportsmen.
The success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweating work for athletes and patience for both training and bench sportsmen.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that London's races will remain in history as competitions between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not for example because of terrorism or ravenous attacks.
"But I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is placed in the second big air race in the United States Colorado.
Copper Mountain's second quarter is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The women's race won Jamie Anderson in the United States.
The rukkajärvi gathered 147 points in the competition.
He tried for the first time in the races with his last jump, caballerial 1080, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and it's good now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go exactly.
Yeah, I'm going to do it again in the races, and I'm going to try again.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from the hyppyr made for the species.
Viking Linen's new fast-ship stiffed to the port in Helsinki
The new FSTR ship in Viking has been very late for the schedule.
The rapid ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6:00.
There were eight lands on the ship loading.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car line is moving a little, the Estonian John Rebane, who waited for access to the Helsinki port, told us at 7:30 a.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles that were waiting for his cars to enter the ship.
Viking's communication manager, Christa Grönlund, says to the IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the harbour in Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a few hours.
The ship was to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.
42-metre special transport interferes with traffic on Thursday night Six.
42 metres of special transport from Muuko to Mustola harbour during Thursday night.
The transport from nine should be available by midnight.
The police are running traffic on the Sixth grade, and traffic may be stopped at times.
From the point of the mud, transport moves along the 13th road to the port of Mustola.
Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story squeezes both the days of the 80s great and the 90s grunge (then David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch for MTV) and their own time – 2001 – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to bigger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory we have stuck in during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's been a long time.
First Day of Camp acted surprisingly well and not just because of his absurd sense of humor (e.g. H. Jon Benjamin was said to speak with the voice of a vegetable box).
The core point of Vitsin is that middle-aged actors act as lustful teenagers of the age of age, and the emphasis on it makes it possible to reach the past a part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act in adults, is less emotionally based, and its parodia is more fragmented: it parodiates for example the 90s Stalkker movies, such as the horror film Hand that spins.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline rollers and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Mr Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't crossed Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one of the crazy cases, Ronald Reagan (then Michael Showalter) is involved as a criminal partner of George H. W. Bush (which is correctly displayed by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this kind of series, the best are side paths.
It's especially fun to see Ancient Paul Rudd, who has a beard-up underneath the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul-lace" film from Singles.
The moments of random madness may raise this series into the flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it receives its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, the number of friends will go to the first night of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series again appeals to another nostalgia: the Americans series of cold wars, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series, which meets the east.
The comedy series has created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made as a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and brandism.
Mostly, the hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their dates have been dubanned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the cops spend time watching TV chess in the same way as the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous music actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, and their boncing will be a fun game.
The Comrade Detective, however, is too caught up in imitation of a clumsy socialist drama, including a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not rich enough.
In a tightened series, it could be better to act as agitprop-satite, even though when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the United States Embassy and in the lobby there are always two fat men in the greasy burgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make all the consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our monkeys were abundant in our own close history and their history.
The Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise into the circle in Macao on Saturday, against the former UFC fighter.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone against Macao, because the Brazilian Leandro Issa fought last year in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the juju and the world championship of the species.
One time, I'm going to fight my own parent.
That's a funny thing, Tauru, 32-year-old, tells me.
Kouvola had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The game was canceled because of logistical problems, but three struggles were received on a quick-term schedule to the Chinese self-government area in Macao.
Tauru hasn't encountered that before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It pissed me off because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter, however, is pleased to have a new time to fight.
Week's waiting doesn't have much to do with preparation.
The transfer doesn't affect fitness, because it doesn't improve in a week.
The condition can get worse if you practice too much now.
In his previous struggles, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are at the standstill.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he's gonna come on hard on the first round and try to take him to the carpet.
He has won the world championship of the jujujuga, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last match of Kouvola didn't go well as planned.
Kevin Belingon, the Philippians, hit Taurua badly at the angle of the eye, and the victory was left to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he never got any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It really bothered me for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rising more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought last time in September.
Taurus had three matches last year.
Now there's a second struggle in the last year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the last few years, and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the future meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the joy to do back.
We got some really good training when we had a guy from Sweden, too.
Practical training was a great help, for on Saturday the Kouvolan will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been able to train against the same size of opponents and practice a vertical match.
A 32-year-old's main tactic is standing up.
You have to beat it wisely.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the land myself.
Lower exports must not be given for free, as they consume most.
Macao's intimidating Tauru, who used to fight in China.
I hear it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, nice nightmare in front of you.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest in the same way when the economic growth has been intensive and the retention of inflation has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth continues to slowly, and the bank has moved interest rates because there is increasing pressure on family income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Commission decided to vote at 6-2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25%, and the interest rate received even less support this month, because economic growth has been intensive.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018, and also warned that more pressure on household income is faced, as inflation is expected to continue to rise near 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to reduce Brexit's rated inflation, and the bank also announced that the loan costs could be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was started to take place one year ago in the remarks of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide a favourable funding of GBP 15 million to banks, i.e. a total of GBP 115 million.
The Bank's interest decision states: "The Commission responsible for Financial Policy forecasts that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when the decline in real income in households reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" to "more wider".
At present, the market forecasts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are "grade" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for the next year.
It now held its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
A pound fell against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
In relation to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and amounted to USD 1.31, which decreased by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and amounted to EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates unchanged was taken after the expected weaker growth rates declined by increased expectations of interest rates. GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects the growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but will slightly increase at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review only gave little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, which, according to the Bank, is worsening before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent the downturn of income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak GBP and will reverse part of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rate was calculated to 0.25% after the result of the EU people's vote, which had fallen to the GBP.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the Central Bank, interest increases had begun to be demanded more and more loudly when the inflation increased the pressure on households, and in July three decision-makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation slowed down to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation was again rising in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the two-percentage overturn was the result of a weak GBP.
"In view of the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition on the mortgage market would seem to increase further when creditors are seeking customers hotly and wanting to end the year firmly," says Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director Andrew Montlake.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending; the reconciliation agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also costless options."
NHS amounts to 10 000 anti-HIVs against
Since September, patients can be prescribed a "verse-reversible" anti-HIV medicine, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute on the financing of the medicine in the public health system in England (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Before the combination, the medicine has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court of law maintained the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS was able to pay the medicine of PrEP, although claiming that it should be financed by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, director of the NHS in England, called the decision declared on Thursday as a "remarkable new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as a "cleaning for an important moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive registrations for an experiment that extends to other clinics in October.
Pre-existing preventive therapy (PrEP) must be used before the combination to reduce the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
The medicine to be taken before intercourse means that there are sufficient medicinal products in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Homicide groups include gay men, bisexual men and transgenders and people with HIV-positive partner who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select conditions for the experiment meet the conditions of applicants for men, women and transgenders and of those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and who have been informed of general medical care may also apply for a trial in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and this week the NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PREP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its allocation, taking and treatment.
"This important new intervention should be complemented and enhanced by existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," Stevens says.
"This is another major achievement in the battle of more than 30 years of age in solving the greatest health challenge of humanity."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted for those who need it and are members of the risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive an experiment funded by the NHS through a medicine they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect that will improve the life of a large number of people.
This was a welcome news."
"Now it is important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one belongs to the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PREP used for the experiment has been obtained, and we will soon be able to protect 10 thousand people in the risk groups from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PreEP experiment is a welcome event, which was overduely prolonged for several months due to the slowdown of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a reverse effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to understand better the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, and that we can protect those exposed to HIV and make a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
The quality of living: the intermediate floor and smart decoration solutions have made a spacious home from a small Earl's Court apartment
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who was enthusiastic about building renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is the first floor of the queen Anna's season-style house, and the success of the renovation tells us that Joanne hasn't packed up and moved yet.
"This is what I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment show and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment.
I just got adored, and I made an offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 square apartment has experienced a perfect change in shape.
It was a twin that only got to the bedroom out of the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired a job from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Erfan Azad, which was located in the Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to use almost four metres of high rooms and to create an apartment that is not just a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two duplicate spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor that fits to stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Technical structures are pretty complicated.
The premises had to be arranged over and over so that they didn't have to ride.
The structures had to be edited so that the height was just appropriate both on top and below."
Erfan was able to place two fully-fledged rooms in the space with fascinating details.
The intermediate floor opens a copper-cross window in Retrouvius to a stylish living space.
Peil-like furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouillen vintage lamps create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling and light of the condition.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor make the corridor look real farther.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens a view into another room.
There is a storage room for Joanne's meals and glass goods in the mirror furniture.
It's more polite that you can hide the kitchen when you don't use it.
The kitchens equipped with the belt door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It needed a little design," Erfan tells us about a steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slips very easily when it's lifted."
With the planning of sound use and storage space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
"When you sell your dwelling, the area solves – or the real estate value," says Erfan.
"In the case of withdrawal, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and lowers the price on the basis of the area."
Joanne's apartment added the area by using high-quality materials that bring luxury.
"Asukas are in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotion bond to the apartment is partially generated on the basis of them," says Erfan.
"No one's going to climb to the power lines on the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra qualitatives can make the basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you will no longer want to move away from your apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiated in her summer book
Princess Sofia's living bird hit the button.
Princess Sofia was represented at Båstad in Sweden for the last time before she was born.
For dinner at the Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a blonde blue dress.
Sofia represented her as a smile at the opportunity.
The Swedish princess Sofia has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented a beautiful blue body-eating costume in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar, which was a wonderful dress for the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue set of costumes.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before she is born.
His calculated time is in September.
To the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed greatly.
The style rushed the big earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastellinine dressed the princess.
Sofia has been on a mission this week in Båstad, Sweden.
Sofia filled her out with a little bag.
Sofia was actually raging in her fresh summer book.
Sofia even became enthusiastic in the event to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, and Sofia said laughing and referring to the final fatigue.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a home of Thai food appeared at the Bay Market.
The Gulfs didn't dare to taste, they walked by.
In the house, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, amongst the people I knew was Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and the Finns did not know thai at that time.
Because the people didn't dare go to dinner, Panja offered free tastes.
Thus he taught the lattes to eat Thai food, the spring roll at once.
Try the taste, he said.
I got stuck in the trunk.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai food at the Lahde Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but to sit next to the stranger.
When you are hungry and places limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and your guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with the dictionary to learn from Thai.
Two years went on the side of the store hall, but then the restaurant had to change because they said the spices they made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the shop.
There's room.
Now we jurors can sit again in our own tables, only in times of congestion, we must be shy to ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his client.
He's been told about the people who've been there and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He's seen how customers' life stages vary, and the food association is changing.
He remembers what kind of man I went to eat my first spring rolls.
He remembers me thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than anyone else, sit at my place next to the kitchen door and change your belongings with Panya, who's on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili bag.
In addition to our taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many speak to him in thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always kind.
He's hard.
Onto the restaurant work, he goes to the mushrooms and the mustard.
Last week, the restaurant was celebrating for two decades.
Our customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarms or attention, this important day went by work.
The finding of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack in Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list of important issues for the work against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 data from Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, there are 173 persons and the document keeps them in addition to their personal data.
More than 130 people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Night-sanoma told me about the list and a couple of weeks backwards.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been specified.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photographs in the investigation of the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mozul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists after the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, there is also a list of names and images of all persons, including their date of birth, the invented subcontractors and information about the home country of the person.
There's also a list of terrorist specialities.
For example, in the case of a 27-year-old German Sami J., a battle name is Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Turkey to join the Isis lines.
His picture next door has been written as a specialized suicide bomber.
There's no more specific information about man's fate.
A total of about 6,000 fighters from Europe have left Isis, whose fate is not certain.
The man fell under the surface in the Tokoinranta in Helsinki
Based on the interviews at the rescue facility, the man wanted to show him to swim.
Even the spider can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person was rescued underwater in Tokoinranta in Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the emergency fireman in Helsinki's rescue facility, the situation was quickly over.
A person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue diver found him under the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after half after 4:00 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hospital.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show him to swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also greatly guided by the locals.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
He was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura in cars, nine people, three seriously injured.
A total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom received less injuries, tells a cautious fireman.
There are men and women amongst the injured.
The accident happened on a three-way cruise at four times a day.
The accident happened when another car turned behind the warning triangle to the other car, says the vigilante fireman.
According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has a 80 km/h speed limit.
Brothers fight over $500 million of real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, and the dispute relates to the family attempt that their Italian family was set up 40 years ago.
Former Chairman of the Carlton Football Society and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live in the value area of Toorak only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court of the division of real estate and business between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave a family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute between the difference.
Brothers and their mothers Anna own 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars together. The family began to collect assets when they bought a shop at the Collingwood Smith Street street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 movements.
The trade chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coastia and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in suburban areas.
According to the agreement with the deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's wealth, and Paul describes his father as a "personal power and a central character".
According to the legal documents, the asset-sharing relationship means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul's worth about $ 176 million.
Paul is not pleased with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think that Colin left the best real estate for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first probation certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several conciliation companies.
Now the brothers are also debating who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says that the argument is not true, and he's blaming Paul for some of the bad management of real estates.
Colin writes in one of his first testimonys that he would like to reach a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin states in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of optional statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicious stores in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as insurance when the family bought a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the first jewelry store in the family.
Colin says that he founded a trade "in the last few years of high school, when Paul was still a child (approximately 10 years of age)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that Luigi and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their boys in accomplice.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in his statement.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group, according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "cake from the economic conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a member of the former Australian League Society and a television star, Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to the life story that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Col and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he said in his text message that he cannot comment correctly because it is dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw me to the courtship according to the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s claims.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue this way," Colin continued and said that he was still hoping that a solution would be made.
Friday, the hope seemed to be out.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new staff manager intends to limit the media use of the president.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new staff manager of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss is not so often in difficulty.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of the White House, met with the senior staff on his first day of work, he spoke of the main problem he intends to resolve: he intends to limit the information of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all the information – both printed and pressed – must be carried through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media usage and fail.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades – and as President, he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the President-in-Office Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with things more balancedly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant at Trump's campaign, told the Politico magazine in February.
At that time, Tara Palmeri, the editor of the Politico, said that "the six former campaign workers said it was essential to control the use of Trump's Twitter that his personal media flow included a uniform flow of praises".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter would never have been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don't know – perhaps Trump's tweets would have been even more arrogant without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems for at least a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trum from causing a seizure.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The present and former workers of the Trump say that he can be tremendously angry about the press cuts in which he is criticised – especially if they tell you about harmful data flows, and then he must know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February when someone illicitly gave the president a copy of the news of the GotNews.com web site, established by Charles C. Johnson, which accused Katie Walshi, Deputy Head of Staff, of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of the harassment, and he had previously disseminated false accusations and revoked them later, and he did not present any concrete evidence.
However, Trump had started the case after reading a question from the staff on Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the staff manager Reince Priebus and the staff secretary of the White House Rob Porter " were trying to introduce a system of management of documents to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to drive their own things.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with the PSG
Neymar of Brazil has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the FC Barcelona to buy out EUR 222 million in the Spanish League.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona was therefore broken down, and he was free to move to the Parisian Society's PSG.
The total transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer cost EUR 105 million of the French Paul Pogba.
The PSG is owned by a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
Former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi, Qatari.
They believe Neymar will arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Oranen turned on alcoholism and fear of flying hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life."
From TV series Rose time and pure white sheets known success writer Raija Oranen just spent his 69th anniversary.
The hypnosis helped Raija Squirrel.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren consider that Raija and his husband Jyrki abandoned the sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, the rental apartment also left.
To the light and the sun, from the old circles, Raija used to take the depression and alcoholism of which he has survived.
Even the external nature is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood medicines.
I had help with alcoholism at times with hypnosis, which also worked with fear of flight, I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiating writer says it openly.
Raja and Jyrki Oranen have travelled the same distance for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism sector, has been working together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen he has always been, ending his life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a great writer's career, only remembers the 44 parts of the clean white sheets of a TV series that touched and moved Finland.
I finally decided to work for the Raiska family industry when I read the 50th anniversary interview on the plane of Liisa Seppälä.
I was the daughter of a sewingman myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I acted as a manicure, Oranen remembers.
He believed that a series of plots and the story changed the attitude of Finns on entrepreneurship.
Anita Save's investigation and the argument revealed it, says Oranen.
Raja Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, has many manuscripts under the work, hundreds of ideas.
The tourians returned to the "million alley"
The most wealthy owners of the West Midlands are once again with the stubborn circumstances that managed to cross the municipality's needs and return to the next field of the houses.
The tourians parked their 20 trailers near a street called millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the road that was needed for the proliferation of the municipality and brought with them children, horses and the army of vans.
The tourians managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
The rageous residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "complete inability to solve the problem".
Anonymous resident tells us that the circumstances came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown passers with stones.
"The yard must be hardened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourians were here in May, and then they left, but they returned again.
They came tonight and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circumstances returned so soon after they were driven away.
"They've been more than before, and they've even counted the horse into the park."
According to Solihull's municipality reporter, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with Solihull police to expel the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many locals as possible report to the police on interference or criminal activities.
It will help to create a comprehensive picture of the situation for judicial proceedings."
Rageous people surrounded Portugal's damaging machine
In Portugal, men who have made a forced bill on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died last night as a result of the forced bill.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with the death attack.
As long as it takes, there are 16 years of prison in Portugal.
A small machine flying men had to make a forced landing on the Sao Joao da Caparica shore near Lisbon yesterday because of a technical defect.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of whom escaped from the landing plane.
The plane hit a man 56-year-old and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Soon after that, the machine rose upwards and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said the Phillipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the plague, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and began to beat it, told the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
Two men on the plane weren't injured in a forced bill.
The tragic loss of his foot was once again won the MM gold: "The accident of the world would not be the world's champion"
Matti Big-Hamari's party early Wednesday morning, Finland's time for MM-cultivate banked slots at the competition at the Canadian Big White.
The Great Hamari won the MM gold of the cross in the races.
All the MMs have now been accumulated by three.
Quite amazing MM races!
The gold was treated twice, with a pretty good heart rate, and the Great Hamari was pleased by the phone.
The 30-year-old Laser thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralum board has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are many new calculators.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count with his friends since he was a young man, and the accident did not take him to the top.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's worthless to say so.
The cards that are divided are playing, the Great Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to titrate a serious accident and to lose a limb to be a lucky kick, and the Great Hamari will not do it.
But he turned it into a terrible trouble.
Yes, I would say that the situation became a winner.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Grand Hamar's biggest boarding rate was already falling.
The Dune went to the top until after the accident.
When I was young, I used to train with my friends, and we were always thrilled to tap X-Games.
But they were far-reaching dreams that went awkward over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow in the beginning of the X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to bitter and grieve.
I decided to pull the hubbles in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The accountant was very pleased about the choice of the wheelchair wider Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded a prize at the sports gala in January.
According to the Great Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal for the paraathlete.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open up eyes to the paraathletic world.
Because it's time to launch a double world champion in Matti Grand Hamar's year of athlete campaign?
Then we'll see it in good time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not conquered all the peak of the lust.
Next year, it's a big goal.
In a year, the paralympires will be visited in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe to return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
In the study of A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees, the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon were investigated.
Syrian refugees baking bread in refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international investigation.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arabs in nine years.
This year, in the study of A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees, the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon were investigated.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half of men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think they would return to their homeland and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s return to their home is most influenced by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war as the most impressive factor for the permanent return to home, while the quarter feels that the most important thing is to leave Isis.
Only less than a tenth leads to the main factors of the decision to improve the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action does not solve the conflict alone
The Syrian young people were asked what is the most important factor for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the abolition of President Bashar al-Assad.
The right quarter holds the President of Al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half feel that political and military solutions are needed to end the Syrian conflict now.
To solve the conflict by means of only military action, you don't believe it's just a quarter.
The majority of the Syrian refugees see Isis deteriorating in the last year, while the fifth experiences its power being strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against Isians, and in general terrorism, the media would provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islamic religion.
Almost as many of them put military measures as well as training reform as a priority.
In a fair tenth view, the most important thing is to create better jobs for young people.
In asking about the impact of Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict does not change during Trump's regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump period.
The opinions are divided into two ways as to whether Russia and Iran's participation has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding so that the Internet stays in order - the database he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company, MariaDB, develops the "fast growing" database of the open source code.
The main product created by MariaDB by Michael "Monty" Widenius does not pay users anything, and it can be developed through the Internet by any prominent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With databases, huge data masses remain in order and rapidly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, acting as MariaDB's technology manager, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who makes a beautiful hand job helps to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database in conjunction with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun purchased MySQL a billion dollars, and a year later, the software giant Oracle stacked Sun with 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large proportion of MySQL developers reported to leave.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise of MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started to develop MariaDB at this stage.
She didn't want her life's work to die.
I hired the 20 best developers from Sun, so I secured the continuity of the code with the same friends that created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
The freedom of development of MariaDB's code to monitor was established by the Foundation.
"These assurances were not made during MySQL," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL billion shops, few Finnish people know nothing about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalé, the economic director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not make profits yet, and Paqvalén is a low-word characteristic of the company.
As far as he reveals, during the current accounting period, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed its surroundings services for which business customers are ready to pay.
MariaDB will also help to exchange databases, which may be a contract for more than a year if the client has used a closed database.
From MySQL, a change to MariaDB will be successful in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telephonica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are the payable customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in distribution packages for Linux systems where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small firm, we have connections with the biggest players.
"Our clients are among the world's largest teleoperators, games, banks and even some kind of central bank", Paqvalé list.
The database markets are still in existence with closed information channels such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
Oraclelle MySQL is also modest in comparison with the company's traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have been losing their market share in recent years, the players such as MariaDB are still negligible in turnover, although fast-growing sinks.
About $50 billion in the database market, the open source databases do not even survive to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money because most users do not pay any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases should have been switched to open or at least started.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most of them will choose the open source code.
This has led to the fact that the licensing of commercial databases has jumped into clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of a closed database is a problem, most of the customer companies have diligently undermined price increases.
"There are a lot of customers to which the transfer is very difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes that the size of the clients is coming to full.
When licensing payments rise every year, the customer will sooner or later be transferred to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous, and the service is better, as the customer can easily switch to another database if you want.
In addition, many companies are facing major changes in their system when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank EIB.
It was the largest growth funding from the EIB to the Nordic countries ever.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now targeted to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year for databases.
"Most countries want to move to the solutions of the open source code and thus use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is spent in Finland on closed health systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do things that are not invented or able to do.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to the most famous open source code promoters of the other Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on an open source code.
I still have 4-5 speeches annually across the world on this subject.
Italy strengthens its approach to NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs who will save their ships of refugees in the Mediterranean that they must not continue their activities unless they commit to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin La Stampa newspaper.
The Minnit warning came the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the ship of the German Jugend Rettet Assistance Organization, which is suspected to have cooperated with the human smugglers that promoted illegal immigration.
Only one year's assistance organisation refused to comment on the detailed accusations of Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
We are very sorry that we are unable to operate in the search and rescue area at the moment, and the organization announced in its opinion in the social media.
"We can only assess the accusations when we have gathered all the necessary information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees by boat children directly from human smugglers who re-enabled ships.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few miles from the coast of Libya, which is reported in a document published by the prosecutor, the contents of which have been published by Italian media.
The men are suspected to be deficient of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area, which is considered to be an enthusiasm to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be involved in an Italian police officer overseeing the activities.
Only three NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: save children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Active Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue activities of the organisation.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct are Nobel Prize Doctors without borders.
On the other hand, Mr Minniti stated that the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy has been dramatically reduced over the last few weeks, which he considers to show that actions to strengthen the Libyan coastal guards and cooperation with local urban leaders are starting to produce results.
"In the last days, light has begun at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He revealed that the plans are to continue this month with the Libyan city leaders on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
He's suspected of murdering his open-ended son in Enontekie, the suspect found in the landscape, a case to the prosecutor.
The suspect was committed in the Enontekio Hats of December last year.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish father-in-law.
Previously, it has been said that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect would have escaped from the ground with two dogs since he did it.
The man was found cold in the landscape, and he did not resist when captured.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be covered in Lapland law in August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and all hairy friends, is dead.
The British actress Robert Hardy died when he was 91.
On Thursday, this family reported the actress' death.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his actress career at the theatre at 24 years old.
During his long career, he also acted in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered by the magic minister Cornelius Toffee's role in Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the James Herriot book All-feeling Friend TV series.
The BBC's popular series was described in total by seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages that led to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that he was considered to be enthusiastic to his boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," said Conrad's father in Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an amendment to the sentence, and he was allowed to wait for the application to be handled in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream-colored sweater, listened to the hands of his judgment in a cross with a crying eye on the ground.
"He did what he did killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to cure his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the action," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown regret."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by "reflective circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter had no "an age or maturity level, and even mental health problems had a significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read the statement of Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, where she said, "It's not going to take a day to make me not mourn the death of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I get through all this. I try to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy's Roy told the court that he was "no" the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never hurts," said Camdy.
The case seems to be a precedent because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a cage poisoning car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had in his text messages provoked his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hold yourself, jump off the roof, stabb yourself. I don't know how many ways there are," Carter wrote in many messages he sent to Roy in two weeks before he died. Roy was at that time on a vacation with his family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start a generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared experts' opinions.
One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, saying, "Michelle Carter needs sympathy and help, no prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Intermediate to Russia the worst then the cold war
The Military Alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on Thursday by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia has now been more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability in the Eastern Ukraine region of Russia, NATO's relationship with Russia has significantly deteriorated.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions are not exacerbated.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a rising situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump, was able to say that the US-Russia had even gone to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to thank the country's poor congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the retreat of car manufacturers
The day before Audin announced BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The BMW leader said that the company believed that " there are even more reasonable options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW’s hometown in Munich, who are considering the restriction or ban on the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he made changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about the re-invitation.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
The emissions of nitrogen oxide from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralising devices are increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkeli has been accused of the involvement of large car companies and of ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, and Volkswagen installed scam equipment in cars that reduced emissions to compliance with the rules in the tests.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi motor development department in charge of the thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Previously on this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation on Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent the European emissions requirements, which was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Aud’s investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
The Venezuela vote began with a false study, large demonstrations in the promise
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuela authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the elections, the President of the National Electoral Board, Tibisay Lucena, told journalists.
Maduro convincing the crisis to end
In Venezuela, a representative was elected on Sunday in the disputed vote, which was to be amended by the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would continue at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais magazine, the national security forces of the country began to take over the parliamentary building of the country on Wednesday night.
The troops are intended to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the Provence Laventel
Laventel has become a symbol of the Provence region in South France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Laventel had fallen due to drought and disease insects, and researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is quite threatening in the Provence region because it has suffered the impact of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear reduction in the number of rains in the spring and especially in the autumn", says Eric Chaisse, a specialist of CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This shortens the lavender's lifetime.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small caskets that spread microbacterials."
The bets are tough.
Laventel oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired component of perfume waters and cosmetics.
" Instead of the small stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are completely missing," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are less and less parts of ether oil."
The solution is sought by increasing moisture, slowing down the moisture in the soil and injecting with a mixture of sausage and water protecting plants, and developing more dry varieties.
A journalist's murder is a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of a once weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, there is a debate on security due to the recent tragedy.
Suppliers have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children home or bring them to the delivery to which a grenade attack was taken in 2009.
Security experts have written three words: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names for each group, but there is no need for evidence, findings and knowledge enough.
The table is written by the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the list of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make news about Mexico chaos life-threatening.
According to the Conservation Committee of journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012, 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened by the federal state have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodoce, the journalist and the source of inspiration.
"The ultimate mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," says Valdez, together, wrote about his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building covers a huge picture of Valdez's middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice." The 30-year journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that decorate Valdez's smiling faces. Valdez has glasses and a branded hat.
The meeting will be held for less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established in particular for the purpose of dealing with journalist cases, but, according to the Conservation Committee of Suppliers, only two prosecutions have been raised so far.
Suppliers are only rarely brought into court, as are thousands of murders relating to drug trafficking and organised crime annually, only a few of them will come to justice.
Riodoce's journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinalo, even though they are crushed by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is only a little useful because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is just a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why this happened."
Valdez had left Riodoce in the state capital in Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota only a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, which is supposed to be linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and crashed it a little further away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was saddled by a wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast, and they're free to wander in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a mouse problem.
Sinalo has been the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzma was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill in the vacuum.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storeed ornamental burial buildings of drug barons, which are larger than many homes.
In the state of the coast, there is a "speak" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez, a 60-year-old, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published Damaso Lopez's interview, leading a competing group that wars against Guzman's boys.
The case may have pissed off Guzman's boys: the suspected customers bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the second release of the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues were no longer able to fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroesta when he decided to set up in 2003 with five colleagues in Riodoce. The paper shares were sold at that time at $50.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
In time, the magazine began to know about its courageous and honest stories, and its sales and advertising grew.
The journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing high-class research journalism without fear of century, and readers fascinated stories that no one else dared to publish.
After eight years of his creation, Riodoce won a respected Mary Moors Cabot prize for his news in Latin America.
During the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Conservation Committee for Supplying the History of Drug Trafficking in Mexico without susceptibility.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the prize of the Conservation Committee of Suppliers.
The drug deal in Sinaloa is a lifestyle, Valdez said at the Rompeviento TV interview last October.
"The meter must accept the task that falls upon him, or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was bathed here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff need Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker — they miss a friend who always had a hug and advice; they miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a panama hat.
He went to the other side of the delivery at the El Guayabo Bar and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were in his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how they can best do their jobs and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking routes.
They were left out of the case," says Bojorquez.
Even in the best case, it meant strong self-sensitive and self-defense,
Trusting your own instincts.
If it feels like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is that, according to Andres Villarreal, the editor of Riodoce, "the impression can be deceived, and that happened in the case of Javier."
The old rules are no longer valid in Sinalo, neither in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, nor in other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's safety training was held, and a few days earlier, it had become clear that only spying programmes sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for wood to shield 40 degrees of grace.
The Government of the State had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises in a four-layer building in the central Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists figured out half of their play, whether these two cops were part of the 50 percent that the state governor did not believe to be trusted.
It has been months since the journalists had been in the mountainous landscape controlled by drug gangs.
To this week's number, Riodoce's delivery was designed for three main things.
The size of boxing was killed by Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinalo.
The newspaper was also going to reveal that the government’s money was focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, had a group of people been kidnapped.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered as the names of the politician of the institutional revolution party (PRI), which has been governed by the Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved in it have recently been accused of a great deal of corruption in cases of publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write the previous cases in the same place, one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid the military riding.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would have received reliable information about the abduction of Valdez.
"We would have already known what had happened," says Villarreal, a 46-year-old, who has gained a grace because of his body structure, the favorite name "El Flaco", "El Flaco".
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that stores signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The employees of the newspaper have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signes with him the next morning when he left the local Prosecutor's office for a demonstration, which was the cause of the new killer's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West Michoacan state three days after the Valdez murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
The journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In the demonstrations of "SOS Press" texts appear in the walkways and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the Valdez investigation.
On the day after the Valdez murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
Since then, he has asked to move him away from the government cases, because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and indifferent society.
In its last book, Valdez, the Drug Drug Drug Drug Drug Drugs, says that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also killed from the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the creation of the police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are slowed down by killing," says Ramirez.
Murders have a depressing effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border State six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writing."
He had a computer keys and headphones next to his cut off head.
Some of the magazines have decided to stop their activities, as in the North Chihuahua border state, the El Norte newspaper after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug maps on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the suppliers have escaped from their states or from the whole country.
It's hard to make a decision.
It is difficult to find a job in the ground, and you have to be careful all the time.
Criminals sometimes searched for a journalist, as apparently visited the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who had to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on his way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, on Friday, Riodoce’s journalists sat in front of the delivery at midnight with a walkway beer when the newest issue of the magazine was completed.
19 people were killed in Mazatlan's beach site in a shooting between competing gangs and security forces.
The war accelerated, as was promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
The journalists put the news on the Riodoce website on their walkie smartphones.
The first page was to be refilled the next day.
Sirens blew near — another shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked at security officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of a murdered founder under this massive image of a man showing a middle finger to all Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even think about stopping the operation. "How could I stop the paper when our trainee asked you to make the case on the street the day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project started with a huge retaliation - "Tough place"
The Hannu Mannis party, which was 39 years old in April, remained short, for the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic Year.
However, the rehearsal period began catastrophicly when Manninen became ill in the flu.
It began a long period of illness, which took almost five weeks.
May went practically completely when he was sick.
First, there was a flu, and finally a child's disease like an inflammation of the ear to which I had to eat an antibiotic.
I was able to make only ten percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It was a tough place when I couldn't use the internship, Manninen tells me about Ilta-Sanoms.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion received a training permit only on the second week of June, which appeared in the KIHU Skillless Test at the World Championship Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skies on rolling mats, with a speed growing every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the testman takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingerhead from the needle.
Last autumn, 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
He came against the wall, Mannenen tells me.
In a better way
After the initials, Manninen says he stayed healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week episode.
It was also Juhannusta that had a half-week vacation on flight work.
I had time to go to the cottage with my family.
During the last season, Manninen attended only four World Cup competitions before the Lahde MM homes.
The best result was seen immediately at the opening contest when Manninen rose up to the top skiing in the 18th.
Guideline drawn
The main coach Petter Kukkonen of the Manner and Land Team has prepared a training and competition plan until next February.
Now we're going to get a different rhythm compared to practice last season.
After the first-time races, Ruka would be the weekend of three world cups.
In December, it's supposed to be part of at least one weekend of the World Cup, maybe Ramsau.
By the end of January, the plans would still be involved in Seefeld.
I hope that's when we find the name on the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Olympics of Pyeongchang would be the sixth winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City, in 2002, the gold team contest celebrated the nummel underline.
Dinosaurus protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first results of the research on the size of a vascular creature found by a Canadian mining worker, which was so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaurs Mona In addition.
It had been so well preserved that researchers could even define that its swamp skin was red brown and had had a "problem past".
According to Current Biology, it has been best preserved by the armed dinosaurus and the best representatives of the world's species.
The recently found fossil is nodosaurus, which was 110-12 million years ago during the mid-term.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly important discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the armed vegetable eater is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine on 21 March 2011 in North Alberta, Canada, and the founder was Shawn Funk's miner.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his finding further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of 100 pounds.
The results of a hard job are now seen.
"If you squeeze your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin studies found that the meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to be a significant threat to this vegetable eater, even though it had a hammer and reminded of the walking tank.
Its red-white armor masked it from its predators, and it was also protected from darker and lighter coloring, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better to confuse its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old Nodosaurus rose into the titles in May and is now present at Tyrrell’s Royal Paleontolog Museum.
The researchers have named Borealope as Markmitchelli museum engineer Mark Mitchell, and Mitchell belonged to a team that took over 7 000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of the body’s bowels and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring, where the body was darker and lighter.
However, the finding was a surprise, because Borealope has significantly higher than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs eating meat preyed it to the extent that evolution favored the survival of hiding instead of the battle.
The current animals, for example, peuros, zebras and armadillos, have similar colouring, which is considerably smaller and easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus were seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, strongly armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the union season were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of Nodosaur organic compounds reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study Nodosaur in order to make conclusions on its life, and they study, inter alia, the content of its bowel to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Researchers believe that it fell in the river when it died and drifted into the sea where it drowned on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go far beyond today.
"This nodosaurus is really important because its stem leather has been preserved and has also been retained in three-dimensional in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early season of union.
Its characterisation does not require much imagination: if you squeeze little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The season was the era of the theropods, the vast, two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors have preyed this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-tonne monster of about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaur researchers have been published in Current Biology, and they believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and was mumbled into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine on 21 March 2011 in North Alberta, Canada, and the founder was Shawn Funk's miner.
According to the museum, it has the best preserved the world's armored dinosaurus with skins and armours from the shoe to the shoe.
On average, the Nodosaurs were five metres long and weighed up to 300 kilos.
Two half-metre pigeons were rising from their ladders.
Researchers believe that this armed vegetable eater passed through the current West Canada until the flooding river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in a sea grave.
Its fossilized residues have remained so well that its skin remains in the tank holes along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a survival is "one rare as a lottery victory.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull skulls still contain fossilated leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the swabs of that foot base."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9th.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on his bed on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high schoolmate:
"The police just killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
As he was devastated, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time for Michael Brown's death, and the white cop had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black guy in Brown Ferguson in Missour's state.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same night, they said people were gathering up to Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police locks and screaming people, as well as Brown's father, a man who claimed himself to be the one who was carrying the sign, said, "Ferguson's police just killed my armed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video, where the police stood in front of the demonstrators with a dog who barking.
He says he also saw a video where another cop shot his rifle and yelled, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," remembers Ferrell.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've already been used to, and it could be called a typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was mad and crying."
He booked a return home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00, and Ferrell came to pick up his six - year - old daughter from his father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next almost three years was documentary film "Whose Streets"?
The film is a story of survival and mental expression, love and loss, strength and persistence from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson's flower messenger and with his daughter dressed with the crown that suited it, they re-engaged the debate on "what is to live black and where." They had spoken about it many times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers their words to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take a daughter with me," said Ferrell later.
"The events of this day are... the climax of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and grow into it.
He must have the capacity to act and to organise, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of experience in black-life, and he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even though, fortunately, I've been able to protect him from a brutal racism, he's still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, which is the opposite of the police station, which became the campsite of activists when they were waiting for information about the case and finally found out that the police would not be charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activism in a new way.
"Aktivismini changed completely after August 9", he says. When he studied at Missour University at St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the minority nurses' students' organization. At that time he focused on food rights and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It just happened somehow."
Week later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, a documentary assistant director in the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell you what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
As a result of the doubt, the number of times when people had appeared in the local community were usually white, who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and continuity.
"We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently said in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted deputy director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with the deceased prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to join the project together with six other locals, followed the events of the shooting of Brown in the years.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis says.
"It was most important to me how local people were presented in the movie because I was presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the purpose was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was to show that in the People's Movement "not a charismatic leader but a community", Ferrell proved to be more open.
Therefore, the document surprises the private sides of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty depressed," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and human representation of blacks require certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story is repeated and reproduces the role of black queer women in a wider Black Lives Matter movement in midnight.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are equal to the queer identity.
"The leadership of the queer women of Mustics has maintained the whole movement," Ferrell says. "This is because we have to fight all the time on many fronts.
"The black queer women have endured everything."
Folayan agrees: "The black women who really maintain the movement, including many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrelli was not selected for the "self-intended" of his queer identity.
Folayan says, "He's got the power to move."
"But there is no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at a lot of things in surgery, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transported from white fabric."
The news film groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrelli's still got two and a half years on parole, and he was convicted of blocking the motorway in the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate of his homes is short and core: "Inconvenient."
Yet he continues to rely on the slogan he learned out on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our power is to fight our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Appropriate Similarity: The artist creates images of Chelsea Manning's DNA.
The Fridman gallery, located in New York, has been hanged in the middle of the exhibition space with faces — white, black and brown faces, which can be seen more closely.
These 30 works are pictures of the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison in which he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a transnational and career contradictory, whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced its term of office on the third last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 shapes based on his gene data, but they are sharp, although a little theoretical position on DNA formatability, complexity and the underlying causal relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born by Bradley Edward, has openly said that she has been in contact with women since the breakdown, and in 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
The manning judged in prison was only one picture: a granular, black-white selfie, where the troubled person Manning sits in the driver's seat, and he has platinum-white wig, which became his character.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a highly popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
That's where he created images on the basis of criminal records, and he got DNA data, for example, on tobacco tubes and gums, and he created pictures of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," said Dewey-Hagborg in a new exhibition at the press conference.
He couldn't visit Manning and he couldn't be filmed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA photo of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muusa suddenly became correspondence mates, and they wrote to each other for a few years.
They even made together the Suppressed Images series book, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo. It described the future where the President would have alleviated Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's judgment only a few days after the publication of the cartoon, which was a lucky coincidence after the seven tough years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now when Donald Trump goes to his own war against slayers and trans-familiar soldiers and is still inventing new ways to strengthen the powerful horrors he had actually to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everything has purpose.
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and under it the great autograph of Manning, where the heart of the last name is the point of the heart. In his opinion, the artist calls for the end of the "automated division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
On the opposite wall there is Manning's DNA cycle: the line of the long C, G and A letters written with the lead pen.
In this 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to detect how similar we all are, at least our biologists.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal from our gene tradition and that gene data are very personal and open for interpretations," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, there's 30 of them out here."
The last job of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg cartoon.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, handed with a megafon.
"If they make you quiet, they've won," says the picture.
"Don't ever shut up."
"It's from a letter I got from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike what was described in the cartoon, Manning hasn't seen the exhibition yet. When Manning shows up, he was greeting the face based on his own gene information than the crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition.
It is deliberate, like all else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA cycle is written on a lead pencil to a height similar to its length (157,5 cm).
"The guys used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd to them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to shoot the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind his release."
The Professor of Northwestern University and the University of Oxford are searching for murder suspects.
The police report that he has launched national searches to find a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who is suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicagolic luxury apartment.
The Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued in Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after she had been stabbed several times.
According to the local report published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza building found a victim with several wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the event and investigating the stabbing as a murder, and the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the Nortwestern University since 2007.
In his e-mail opinion, Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for social relations at the University, stated that Lathem is now free from administrative leave and is prohibited from accessing the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University will help in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as an assistant to financial care at the University of Oxford.
The statement sent by the College and Somerville College’s report by e-mail states that "We have been in contact with the police in Britain and we are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hoped to give up.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he would call on the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea where they are, and we keep figuring our searches," said Guglielmi.
According to Gugliel, local, regional and national authorities will help to search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an unambiguous clue that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene of the event to be terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following announcement to the inhabitants: "Police is currently examining the events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill the Muslims in London.
"I'm not an antimuslim, I'm a Catholic," said the judge to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to his threats to blow up an Islamic book shop in London and "tape all Muslims."
According to the Independent Leaf, David Moffatt was sentenced, among other things, for gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had "speaked to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not linked to the events of the bookstore.
The authorities noticed that Moffatt was dressed in the same dwelling as the suspect of book trade events, said the police reporter.
I'm not an antimuslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the cops in questioning.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. about 690 euros of legal expenses and 85 GBP, i.e. some 95 euros of compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the activities under WADA's road map in the near future" – Vice-President Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Vice-President Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon conclude action under the Roadmap of the World Antidoping Office WADA in order to restore the powers of the Russian Antidoping Commission to RUSADA.
"A part of the measures under the road map has already been taken and RUSADA had the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in these respects", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
However, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been reported, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the road map requires the Russian antidoping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which is the state's alleged contribution to the Russian sport doping.
Mutko said: "The investigation is underway because our antidoping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
There were no public programmes and we cannot admit something that was not there."
Mutkon said that there were echoes of the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian independent Public Antidoping Commission.
Previously on the same day, Smirnov, spoke to the Russian RSport sports media, acknowledged that there have been problems with Russian antidoping machines. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report without any condition," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the extent of the dopingskandaal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA's director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After his visit, he said that the organization was on a "right road" towards reinstated powers.
British organization as a skeptic for Finnish-loved innovation: "no evidence" for the health benefits of maternity packages
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust, who fights the death of the concealed death, prohibits the use of its own brochures in the maternity packages to be distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity package would reduce the risk of concealing death.
A concealed death means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert of British health authorities on a child’s safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed on them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed us.
In Finland, there is one of the world's lowest child mortality readings, only two dead thousand per born.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenagers.
The fact that a box is given to each family may be one of the factors.
However, it cannot be said for sure, Mr. Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and concealed death.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for a free period of 80 years.
The package contains various supplies such as child clothes.
This year, 53 products are available.
The package itself is a cardboard box to which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
On the other hand, Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for sleepplaces if there is no frame or soil bed available.
The organisation recommends that the packaging be used only for daytime sleep and stop using it at a time when the child can turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pet animals away from the packaging and making sure that they are not wet or dirty.
A vicious bastard escaped from a Japanese zoo to repeat
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and escaped to repeat in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa’s zoo in Okama, West Japan, Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told us.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55-pound and about a foot long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the frog is allowed to travel freely in the area of the farm.
The zoo has not received eyewitnesses from the turtle.
The last runner of the manna happened last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car, and I asked my colleagues for help, and Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees' satisfaction in their online trade startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers felt suspicious.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," says Errett. Madison Reed, the company in the hair management sector, focuses on online trade. The company has 75 employees.
And then she decided to rely on external assistance.
The market has increasingly become a new source of staff management startups that help other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure the employee's commitment. They can make surveys and target them for certain teams and groups of populations, and provide anonymous reporting services for their employees, and in some cases direct contact with the government, alongside the top management.
"Our health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" asks the founder of the Glintstar in Redwood City and CEO Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure employees' commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained a deeper view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map on which one look, which departments the employees are more unsatisfactory and which leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of work so that they do not become the next Uber.
Such failures are an attractive business opportunity for startups such as Glint.
Business administration, regulation and conformity are a global industry whose value can rise to more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent undue use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when the reputation of Uber experienced a collage.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make customized surveys, to collect answers confidentially in real time and to map problem areas.
In addition, workers may inform unauthorised behaviour by means of an anonymous text message.
And if there is any reason to suspect the leader of the inconsistencies, the complaints will go directly to the government of the company.
"The general opinion has excluded the authorities," says the founder of Convercent and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He reminds us that if the company treats its employees in a bad way or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not interfere. Consumers can start boikotizing the company and can also lose workers and become challenged to the court.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 offices. The company has used Convercent for more than a year, because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily contacted by the main office.
Previously, the practice was that if the worker wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or the email address that was able to report to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's lawyer. According to him, the complaints made by workers were difficult to follow.
Previously, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with faster.
"I will have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the worker," says Vitrano, which leads the risk management team of the Ruby Tuesday.
At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from prosecution of employment relationships.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in the context of Enron scandal.
Only with the social media, companies realized that they could no longer prevent public investigations of their slumbers.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethics control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is charged regularly.
It is a business model approved by the capital investors and an opportunity, both Glint and Convercent support capital investors.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million of funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, a total of USD 47 million.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected a total of $60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
A number of studies show that workers expect more from their workplaces.
Good wages on the market for competitions like silicon accords, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful enterprise.
"Employees commit more to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are listened and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn, responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors will receive income when companies succeed, and the companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to the professionals in the workplace culture, information on the commitment of workers is important,
but it is useless if it is not based on measures.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it may be considered as a sign of a change.
And if the change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the employee's commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says the Director-General of Kotter International, Russell Raath, who has seen companies relying too much on collecting information.
"If the company fails to take action, the workers will start to wonder if they heard
And whether their opinions matter anything.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to this report, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys every month and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After Errett had gathered feedback from workers who were frustrated with decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and to organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees more and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in the sector known for the high turnover of workers.
"If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbor, reports the news office TT.
The woman in Göteborg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed the cell phone hanging at the end of a string outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera was cameraed in the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress.
When she arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon afterwards it was recalculated in the window.
A 20-year-old man who suspected of being concealed has confessed to his photograph of a woman.
But he claimed that only the woman's face was pictured.
The video on the phone was deleted, and the police had failed to return it to evidence.
In the interrogations, the man has confessed the act, but he refused to commit a crime.
The man who described it was justified to say that he loved his neighbor as a "good mad."
According to the news office TT, a man is being charged with an indictment.
Teachers demand more licza in the autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than the export industry, for example, but the difference should be reduced, said OAJ's President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary surgery of the public sector leaves underlines the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would in any way not involve holiday money operations.
In the municipal sector, contracts will be concluded only after the private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of the increase are clear.
Lukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luke hasn't yet revealed.
Lukkainen is also Chairman of Juko, a publicly trained negotiating organisation.
Lukkainen: Holiday money surgery increases the difference in earnings
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a deterioration in the purchasing power of employees in the public sector while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the Lukas, the fixed-term holiday payment operation will further sharpen the difference in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher may be
In addition, the OAJ points out that equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences that are best and most vulnerable are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning results are deteriorating and differences between students and regions continue to grow.
The day of Bruins players was long when NCAA reduced daily exercises with two
It's about 11 o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of American football players in the UCLA have stayed talking on the other side of the campus.
Some of them have stripped their shirts off, their backs shine from the sand after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this chat room for a few minutes is a noon break.
After three hours of rehearsal, players studying the summer courses of the university will return to the gym to read the final tests. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Centre at half a seven.
"The following three days will be tough on these guys," says Bruins Coach Jim Mora, a little before Monday, to Tuesday.
The university's roofing organization reduced the number of daily training times in two. The purpose of this change was to reduce the number of players' jobs, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are carried out.
That's why the three first exercises of the UCLA began over five minutes in the evening, and it was hard to find space already on the full schedules of the players.
Limiting training times one day means that there are more training days than before. This year, the camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the training period of Westwood, which continued through the six of Mora, when exercises were held at the same time as summer courses.
Practices are intended to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported NCAA's change of rules, even though it made players' schedules even more stringent.
"We'll really load them up for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think it'll make things easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view from the training fields to the parking area next to the Luskin Center, a flat hotel that has already been bombed over the paddles behind the goal base.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel on the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the period when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," says Mora.
"The problem is that people can book a room and film exercises from there for a video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of money is paid from the video on the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, the Central African Rwanda presidential elections will be held, and the winner is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing its third period, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group, the RPF, ended the genocide organized by the extremes.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, about breaking the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue the amendment of the Constitution which was limited to the two periods of Presidenthood.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investment has been launched.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in combining a country divided by genocide.
The success of Ruanda has led many Africans to ask if Liberal Multiparty Democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised more freedom to his people after the land has been raised to their feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights the false news by intensifying the facts
Facebook intends to send possible false news more and more often to independent facts inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published on its website an opinion that it will start using updated engineering lessons for the identification of false news. Any false news will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being the biggest distributors of fake news, and many believe that the results of the U.S. presidential election were influenced by false news in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed on false news before the May presidential election and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove the hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the independent inspectors' screen. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what read and distribute," said Sara Su, the Facebook news feed product manager in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the related articles and will also make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Book of Cartoons: The story of a castle
The small Scotney castle in the Countess of Kent is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of storming history, and now this charming place in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a cartoon book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old mop - hair writer.
"It's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says intimidously.
"I know a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, describes the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian period. Each story has been pictured by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes' archives. In 2014, he was released by Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Library.
"I moved to tears when I noticed in the letter a thumb print, and the letter had written a double agent working on the divisions in the 17th century," says Rhodes.
"It was her fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then fire was used as light.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on his own.
I love archives!"
The author of old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Board of Arts in England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days examining the Victorian castle, archives, treasures and rarenesses, such as the hyena heads hanged on the walls and bottles of hundreds of trees.
He circulated the old castle with ruins and lands and discussed with the forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes with the book of imaginative artists.
Evening night, he took whiskey and started writing.
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, as the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was only about to begin the archive visit. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the extra ones to the attic.
There were journals in the archives, letters from the time of the Empire of England and maps about who owned anything. "You could imagine that the disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But this is where the families fought even one cow.
It reminded me that we'd be allowed to be."
Some of the storys of the book are going from the castle to England's history, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man shortly after the castle, who is connected to England's homeboy revenge in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The rebel of England began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion can begin from the riot.
Perhaps these events are in connection with each other."
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as the Priest, a story of the priest that Darrell's family hid seven years during the revelation of England.
The Smuggler, again, tells the smuggler Arthur Darrell story from the 17th century. It is said that he framed his own funeral with stones filled with a coffin (this was noted years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrels are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been pretty staggers, and they kept getting into debts and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by getting married to the wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to sprinkle the heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a cartoon about Lifemäe, a parantoe from the early 1900s, which has left only a hollow plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this devil's ark yet."
Distribute to Russia the worst then the cold war
The Military Alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on Thursday by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia has now been more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular since the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability in the Eastern Ukraine region of Russia, NATO's relationship with Russia has significantly deteriorated.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions are not exacerbated.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid a rising situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump, was able to say that the US-Russia had even gone to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to thank the country's poor congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops the fight against Anthony Joshua.
The long-term world champion Vladimir Klitshko of professional boxing ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, fought as a professional 69 times, winning the 64.
He held various MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him at points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley's stadium and lost after a wild fight in the 11th row.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in the retreat in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get a sufficient distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me when he was reporting.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I would never have imagined that I had such a long, incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's reasons for his decision on the video.
In the release, Klitshkon manager Bernd Bönte reported that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he would like to stop if he had enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, said Bönte.
Klitshko has been dating Hayden Panettire, an American actor since 2009.
The Parish has one child, daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former world champion in the heavyweight series.
During the 2008-12 period, the brothers managed the MMs of the different alliances at the same time.
The weather-breaker in Finland is craving conditions: "Get out of the file"
Minna Nikkanen, a swamp jumper, has suffered the circumstances during the summer's outer iron season.
Minna Nikkas has been having problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken a woman out of the file.
London's MM races also have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer's shaft jumper against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but I couldn't understand that I couldn't even get the little wings to move properly, Nikkanen said after Innsbruck's race.
I've been competing and practicing here know how many times I've never experienced the same different wind in this place, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardisation of the jump has been very difficult, even when the exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s races.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London, too.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together, whether it's cold-drying or what.
It's been cold and wind, and it's taken out.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to his 455 grid jump, he got into the MM races.
It's gone 445.
The relationship in London is not the same for all of us.
You have to be gentle and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to cross the 460 in the Friday.
Why don't you change your training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany since early.
I got the jump together and the technology was standardized.
I should have done the same thing right now.
Normally, he's been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
A little wind will go as long as it's standard.
Experienced ex-husband ruined politicians up above: "We don't have any resources now or for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in the hat and keep the state budget under the debt, warn Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no distribution.
In 2015, he interviewed the retired Virta at the Number One in Wednesday.
The next year's budget of the State is about to start.
Recently, the proposals made by politicians, including the increase in the guarantee, the calculation of car tax and the support of electric bicycles, are considered by Virtanen as election speeches.
They mostly say that elections are beginning to be close because, when 10% of the government budget is funded with additional debt, we have no resources now and for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the thief when they owe you, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all the debts are owed to children.
The power has long experience in preparing the state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a secretary of the budget and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Head of Budget.
For the last time he retired, he was head of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
In the interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the forecast economic growth of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All prophecies estimate that this is a sludge that is already coming next year to go into the under-quarters, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase in tens of years.
Washington changes permanent residence permit rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the permanent residence permit, namely Green Card rules, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary employment permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain land migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and can support themselves and who have useful skills for our economy," said Trump, according to the media.
The wife of the Danish queen does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree were described in April.
The Danish queen Margareta, 77, and his spouse, Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next door, says the court of Denmark.
Traditionally, the governing couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde's jury, the court states when announced Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is the cause of the prince's displeasure in his role in the king's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his roles and titles in the Danish monarch, the court's communication manager, Lene Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
The prince’s decision not to bury her next to the queen is naturally a result of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of his spouse’s burial place and understands the decision.
The time of horror on the road: The car was on the motorway.
Tomm had an open mate and two little kids on the ride.
They weren't injured in an accident, but they won't receive money from the insurance if the other party is not targeted.
The accident happened in Vantaa with Keimolanport.
Architecture photo of the building site in Kehä III.
Tommi Vantaa says his family survived on Tuesday by a miracle store in a car accident.
Tommi, his open-ended partner, Riina, and the two small children of the couple, drove on the motorway to Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From ring III's connection to Hämeenlinnan's road, it took a speed band along the white car that was driving to the side of the family's car, Tommi says.
Without the traffic, the car would've come with Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car ran into the radius with a lot of speed.
The parents and the two little children on the back seats weren't hurt.
One of the children is slightly less than three years old, the other is less than a year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one who passed was even driving towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident happened about 5:20 p.m.
Tom said no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency station.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The ambulance and rescue personnel came in, and the family's condition was reviewed.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi tells us that he and the open party have a small income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a few years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family says Tom won't get the money.
Therefore, the family wishes to see eyewitnesses about the car that caused the family to be distracted.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the yard and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the car's license number was the beginning of the SIG.
If you don't get caught, I don't know how we're doing economically, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or that something knows is connected to the police.
From the Itä-University Police Department and the Central Newland rescue facility confirm that they have had a mission on the accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and the case was repaired at 21.15: Unlike the case originally said, the other car did not come to the band of the incoming ones, but had to drive from the speed band to the side of the family.
Lotta Jäppinen's guided performance deals with human relationships by humor - The self-detector will be seen at the What? theatre Friday and Saturday
The Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings his first-born guidance to what? theatre.
The self-detector is a music theater of past relationships and inadequacy.
According to Director Lotta Jäppinen, it'll still be a good time.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
I don't think you're going to stay in trouble, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the rounding summer theater is carried out with a long-term budget and with a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation challenges to consider what a person reveals himself when he comes to a new person.
Do you think he might play some role or approach another coat open?
Unfashioned presentation mixed with fact and fiction
The Jäpinen has been both guiding and dramatizing the performance.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plan.
The director believes that even though the presentation is depressing the thoughts of young people, he talks about all ages.
The Jäpinen stresses that the self-detector does not directly tell us about his own relationships or the human relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction are confusing.
I'm sure my world of dignity will care for the show.
I don't think human relations would be bad, but I do not think that human relationship, especially a relationship, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-detector draws a timely picture of young adults aged 100 in Finland.
According to him, many have learned much about human relationships from their parents, many of whom have been separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
In the presentation, the Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Ella Snellman.
The music reconciliation is Jäpisen and Roka.
Love in the theater was burned in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is a director of the theatre expression at the Art Academy of Applied Sciences at the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind, and there's another one in front of him.
The extreme enthusiasm on the theater has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The cultivation of music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola's theatre and has played, among other things, at the University Children's Theatre in Helsinki and in the Castle Theatre in Turku.
Instructions have become more and more interesting.
The self-detector received his premiere last week in Helsinki at Narri's scene.
In the future, a presentation of about 45 minutes has also seen at least in the University of Jäppinen in Turku.
Suicide detector at Kouvolan What? at the theatre on 4 August at 19 and 5 August at 14 and 19 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from the terrible motocrosson accident - the necklace broke.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
In this partnership bill, hundreds of days a year travelled around the world for twenty years and chased his dreams of the gold of the Olympics.
The dream was realised in 2002, but Lahtella's movement continued.
He was not only a tired trainee, but also a pilot of new species.
There are probably not many types of sports on the ground that a chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's been inspiring to practice.
There's always something new, and Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtella completely.
In 2014, Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at my home for a year, says Lahtela.
There was bad luck at the bridal.
He also admits that the age might have had a share of injuries.
Driving a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't get the boundaries.
It's just so hard as a species that you don't want to do too much for this 40-year-old!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long rush in the back of the Japanese freestyle country team as the head coach.
Lahtela began to wash immediately after the end of her own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged its protective device in the slopes and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that even my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I actually enjoyed it because I was actually only able to be once.
The forced break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's chief coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he would have burned down.
It's easier to find places in the Kropa that have gone apart than intact!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started a Finnish freestyle country team coach about a year ago.
During the same period, he found a safer hobby to replace the bullies.
I switched the motocross to the frisbeegolf!
It just left the shovel right away.
At his worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-inspired trainer, he does not require his training to be like him.
I don't make everyone get into the same fashion.
There is room for our species culture to be like theirs and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming, and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot – just when it began to feel that 2017 can no longer become more strange.
Yes.
Sexrobots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking seriously the generalisation of sex robots", says the founding member of the Foundation and emerging professor of robotic and artificial intelligence from Noel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are sneaking, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them more and more," said Sharkey at the report's conference.
Sexuines have developed from blowing dolls to robots with warm-sensitive silicon skin and artificial intelligence features that are similar to the use of man.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and colour of fingernails.
The more worrying it is that robots have "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexuines are developed to be robots with silicon skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, perhaps to be shy.
True Companion Roxxxy Gold has pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts to the user's personality as perfectly as possible," advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It could be tired, talking in a mood or "in a mood."
There are many worrying traits in the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the submissiveness of women and direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, a shy and opposing programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot with vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex game.
Their generalisation and development is something of a darker and deeper culture: a recession towards gender equality, which is one of the alternatives among others.
Of course, the majority of men are not getting sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, Marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only when the market authorizes it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House is sitting in the President who has been compliant with women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Organitar) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, for example, images of hanged bodies and out of digged eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sexrobots are trying to make as much like real women (with porn stars scales) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and move to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — nothing that implies independence or the fantasy of perfect surrender.
They're pleased servants.
A slavery.
Police suspected: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by Isis Chief
The Chief of the Exclusive Organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of about taking the bomb into the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person belonging to Daddy's leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects say the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company stopped before the security check.
The police don't tell me more why the company was interrupting.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-sparing device and to take the device to a public location, such as a public means of transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to the suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in the police patrols on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
The good sides of the drummer?
Make Mitt Romney look like a healthy sense of heritage.
During the Trump period, it has been repeated until bored that the strong storm of the voters has also broken up families at the level of the voters.
On the way of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper advisors instructed how to cope with relatives who voted Trum.
We all want to blow up our information bubbles.
Less attention has been given to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm going to tell you about this because my cousin visited me this week in New York, and he's a poet living in Chicago, who's been in the middle of our family with the Republicans for a long time.
He reminded me that the common enemy could have a powerful combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousin’s acquaintances – including a sister with the Republicans who he has argued with for decades of politics – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
In the table, it is a good thing, but with a broader view, there are significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we are talking about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare his tricks.
In the long term, there is even more horrifying chance that Trump normalizes the right extreme Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I am reluctant to remember Mitt Romney's controlled version of madness: a dog on the car roof, a income tax of 14% (and his tax returns have been seen at least).
Once Trump's season is over, the next candidate for the Republican president needs to be clear, and it feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park Karuselli, which is the biggest carousel in the park department in New York, and the best thing I could get in New York with three dollars without caffeine.
Karusell’s horses are enormous, in the midst of the characters — creepy clowns and animals looking back in the horror — and the underlying music is strangely fascinating.
With time, many of New York's characteristics become disappointing: the sights of high buildings begin to get bored, the city's siluette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I haven't completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large traffic circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it is not counted.
Instead, the carousel of the Central Park is still a odd experience — even to the extent that two two years old, one eleven and two 40 women enjoy it hugely.
I would have given the Karusell full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the commodity house to evaluate my "paying experience" with a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the cafe in my corner, but there I will also be given the opportunity to combine the 15% service money when I go get a coffee dish.
This slows down the daily interaction and presses the customer server to put their personality into a game in a situation where it does not need it.
The salesman of the trailer smiled as an apology when I was tired of giving five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from the Inter - "No trust in the leadership"
The FC Inter has today released the mission of the Shefki Kuq Association's representative team's coach.
The training responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was formerly an assistant coach.
The rest of the training team will continue in its current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in, among other things, English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta associated with the Inter Training Group has completed UEFA Pro licence last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, President of the FC Intergovernmental Government, regretted what happened.
Exchange of trainer is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club leadership, when no other option was available, Håkans commented on the communication of the association.
The Piccareta Agreement is in force until the end of the period.
He is already responsible for other training teams at home tomorrow's home match against the HIFK.
According to the evening statements, the team's been drowning on Thursday.
Kuqi told the players this Thursday morning that Piccareta and John Allen have been transferred away from the company's assistant coach.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a great deal together in the Inter match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in the '80s, would you identify a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius published a young image in Instagram.
Several buggers have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at the camera seriously.
A long time ago, seriously, he's sending me a message.
If the picture doesn't show, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken of painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a photo pair of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he's seen 20 years ago, and in the second he poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his image text, Lampenius thinks about his own growth as a person and refers to eating problems he suffered when he was younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look much the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to English hashtags to life, eating disorder, uncertainty, confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about the eating work of the previous years.
He was already in hospital when he was 14 years old because of anorexia and orthodox.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing started to be a bit of a problem.
In addition to the therapies and the comparability, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the slices he had in his wrists, which he said he had fallen in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder of the prosecutors' complained of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkam in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was an intruder at night hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have reported their intention to appeal again, because they consider the judgment of Pistorius for six years too mild.
The Kingdom Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a bunch of unauthorized people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st, with two Bulgarians among the camps.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that the Bulgarians were released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and are already giving significant fines to all who are camping outside the areas reserved for purpose.
The checks will be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court might impose a fine.
The liquid's stock's sinking already -7.7%
The oil processor Nesthe's share has fallen by 7.7 per cent at about 11.00.
Its income before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has taken place on a slightly packed side both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe today.
After a small opening of the stock market, the large European Stoxxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2 per cent.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had declined by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trade and OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange amounted to EUR 41 million, nine million of which were the morning’s press release.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may alleviate irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like gastrointestinal nightmares.
However, the recent study contradicts: a large diet containing meat protein and milk products may facilitate an irritated bowel syndrome.
An irritated bowel syndrome is an unparalleled disease with approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from the Washington University found that the protein contained is the necessary amino acid trüptophane to help the body develop immune cells that enhance the intestinal tolerance.
According to the investigative director Marco Colonna, the immune cells were guarded by the swabs and ensure that the harmful microbies are not hidden in the food.
Infectious cells balance cells that enhance tolerance, protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be an irritated bowel syndrome.
The tests found that immune cells that enhanced tolerance are present in mice with a specific intestinal bacteria.
This bacteria needs tryptophan so that immune cells develop. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We identified the link between the development of Lactobacillus reuter and the development of tolerance-producing cells. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbial intestine," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mouse diet had tryptophan, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same applies in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuter and a high-purpose diet may enhance the intestinal tolerance and reduce the inflammatory sensitivity.
When investigating immune cells that enhanced tolerance, doctor Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not in the same species of mice, which were separated from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiological intestines of mice, i.e. the normal bacteria, fungi and viruses of the gastrointestinal tract.
When the DNA of the intestines of the mice was investigated, six bacterial species were observed in the mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteries were administered in a sterile environment to mice with no intestinal microbials and no immune cells developed, immune cells began to develop.
Researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in fluids and transferred small amounts of liquids — without bacteria — to unkypical immune cells isolated from the mouse.
Immune cells developed intolerance-building cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a side product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in feeding mice, the number of tolerance-treatment cells increased by approximately 50 per cent.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our gastrointestinal channel.
It is not yet known whether tranquilizers from the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria produce cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, in patients with annoyed bowel syndrome, there have been evidence of the related genetic errors associated with tryptophan.
"We probably want to promote the development of these cells because they regulate the inflammation on the inside of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United got into the lines of the "neron" after making an agreement with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matic. The central field player debytoed at the Manchester United rows in the battle against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
The Matic, who moved from Chelsea to 40 million pounds, started a 2-1 win in Dublin, in the United's last round before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira as a defending middle field player.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved in the blue shirt tour of Asia before the beginning of the season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking makes him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be more prepared than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to slit his opening meeting for the beginning of the season.
Independents revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the Society has already done a "credible job" by obtaining three of his four priority players.
"Three of the four – we must thank the company" he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they did a great job."
Flying balloon women tortured Germany for two rounds
The Finnish Women's Land Team lost its fourth match for Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routine play is high.
From the level of their game was in every sector, Finland's chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the release.

Reuters: The Great Jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr in Russia
In the United States, the great jury has sent challenges with regard to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already challenged Donald Trump Jr and the Russian attorney named from the Kreml links, Natalia Veselnitskaja.
It is reported by the Reuters News Office, which, at the same time, confirms the information that Wall Street Journal reveals earlier on Thursday about the summoning of a great jury.
According to Reuters, the great jury has sent challenges to the meeting of Veselnitskaya, known as Trump Jr and Kreml, which was held during the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the current advisor of the White House Jared Kushner.
According to the sources of Reuters, the fact that the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has summoned a large jury in Washington means the accuracy of Russia's investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a great jury to help in an investigation aimed at examining Russia's interference with the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his closest neighbours cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence found in the prosecutor's investigation and decides whether the prosecution should be brought up.
The British inventor drove himself into his home and his car with his hand twisted.
Firstly, the British inventor has turned himself into a microchip in the whole country, so that he can open his home outside door, get to his office and start his car by swinging his hand.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and the front finger, and now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq's technology.
Northam cooperates with the anaesthetic doctor Geoff Watson, the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also changes the locks of the houses and cars to be compatible with the microchip.
Northam's married, and he's got one child, and he's put a microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car that starts when he drops his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
The final decision of the White House to fly the Navy Helicopter to the southern grassland of the White House to the American production event came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D is called Marine One when the President is on its way. It was a bench in the White House on 17 July 2017, in which American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and a bunch of White House officials were familiar with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a trailer from Mississip.
The Military Office of the White House had asked the helicopter to take place only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern grassland for a "normal" event. This is evident from the HMX-1-helicopter fleet of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility", the commander of HMX-1 wrote an e-mail on the day before the event to his commander, who is an auxiliary commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grassland at 7 a.m. in the morning of 17 July, and the event would begin at 3 a.m., and the helicopter would not leave the place until the lawn was emptyed in the evening between six and nine.
In addition, the message mentioned that if helicopter departure from the White House would be delayed, another crew would be needed on the spot due to restrictions on service time.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIME magazine do not identify the need for another crew.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits the use of state property by federal workers for political purposes.
According to the papers, HMX-1 was questioning, breaking the law of the event.
One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was broken here, and they told us not to break it," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," answered the deputy commander.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
In the event, the President spoke in favour of the health reform at the Senate's hearing and for a wider state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents shall use them on their journeys,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's activities attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president's campaign event in Melbourne in Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane in Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American workers' American materials from all 50 states," said the White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly take training flights in the area of Washington and train in the southern grassland to bring the president to the White House by centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters were also flying that day for 11 hours in non-presidential support missions.
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's reporter said that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation in the southern grassfield of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President's missions, and the exact assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the VH-3D helicopter compensation level is $24.380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 documents, flights from the Quantico base from Virginia state to the White House lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"Walters say, the calculation of the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called deployed costs, which are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 report by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
During the event, Sean Spicer, former Secretary of the White House, defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are extremely proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and that they must employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard.
It is absolutely appropriate to highlight it."
It's not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down the fire truck driver.
In the White House Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three."

The State Prosecutor of Venezuela demands the right to prevent the nomination of the new representative of the country.
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a decision of the Court to prevent the nomination of the new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the representative will be appointed on Friday at the vote on last Sunday.
In the disputed vote, a representative was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to the prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent was requested for constituent suspicion.
Ortega has also started the election investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised the representation vote told us that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuela authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were subject to representation, and the elected 555 representatives, including the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representative may dismantle the opposition-led congress and amend the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been broadly condemned.
The opposition considers the constitution to be a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called this a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
They have been wounded by a number of people and over 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis after the oil price fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show the view on Friday, when the new delegation is to start.
The Russian man given up by Finland was sentenced to prison for 4 years in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court of Justice condemned the 41-year-old Maksi Senah for almost four years of imprisonment in the world of computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following the request made by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judicial authorities, despite Russian objections, reports AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months in jail.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled after the sentence of imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly accused Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the prosecution, Senah had been using a computer virus called Ebury, which had captured tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for users' names and passwords.
The cheaters then used data by further directing Internet traffic, using clippings and spam distribution.
According to Kenneth Blanco, according to the Criminal Department of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to pursue cybercrimes.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told me in the press.
Edited at 20.58: Fixed name of the sentenced person.

Timo Soin's questioned article entitled "Then came the Flood"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog paper on Thursday, titled by a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to the government of the thirty-seven parliamentary parties.
And then there came a flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of the Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his lover, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the Flood Comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the revelations of the "water Flood of Our Afternoons" or "water Flood After Me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women.
The elections are representative only if they can vote on all members of society, including women, said the Head of the UN Afghanistan delegation on Wednesday.
Mr Nicholas Haysom, interim Head of the UN Aid Mission, stated that there are hundreds of women in the elections of the county councils, three women seeking to be Vice-President, and more than 30% of recently registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be underlined too much," said Haysom in his opinion on Wednesday.
The elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan Province Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
Taliban has posed threats to elections at the same time as the international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time the power will be transferred peacefully from the democratically elected government to the other.
Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of 3,6 million registered voters are women.

Tonight's clearer and more outrageous.
The weather front brings abundant rain in the south and in the middle of the country, and there may also be a thunder in the south.
There's a lunch chair in the south of the evening, and it's clearer, some rain can come.
The afternoon temperature is about fifteen in the rain, on the southern coast after a more united rain is stopped near 20 degrees.

In the north, the rains remain small.
On Saturday, there are hundreds of places in the southern and middle of the country, including thunder.
The rain also extends to some of Kainuu.
In the north, cloudyness is abundant in the afternoon and comes with individual rainbows.
The southern coast is winding from the south, the air flow in the middle and north of the country is east.

The threat of the flood of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly affected by the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleet" tourism: there are only a few hours in the site and there are large crowds of attractions.
Venice has been suppressed by quick day trips to tourists in the city.
In the narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that Venice residents no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move even further away from the historic centre, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian are writing about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities consider restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon of low quality tourism.
When a large cruise ship arrives, two or three hours will be given.
You follow the flag guide from Piazza to Roma on the Rialton Bridge and the Saint Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini’s dominant and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the workplace, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the towns' identity.
The Toronto of St. Mark also belongs to the most popular visits to the Historical Centre in Venice.
The church of St. Mark is on the Tori side.
Local anger is also mainly targeted at cruise ships.
In the historic centre of Venice, more than 50,000 locals live.
In 1951 there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July estimated 2,000 Venezuelans showed their opinions against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives people away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, a few years later in Venice, there aren't just tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says the demonstration organised by Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the income they need and create the need for many jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruises should move away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, surely thinks that the situation would change if Venetto's administrative area, where Venezia is also located, could have more power to decide on its own matters unless it is full of autonomy.
Some 20-30 million tourists visit Venice each year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Difficulty traffic on motorways
On the road north on the road between Kuopio and Silill Lake, a line from Thursday afternoon’s work has had congestions of miles of traffic.
The area is covered by motorways, which slows down traffic, reports Savo Sanom.
In the case of sciences, the speed limit of 50 kilometres is instead of a normal 120 kilometres hour speed.
However, even in a 50-mile restricted area, traffic had progressed in places on Thursday afternoon.
The road works moved on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Lake Silill on the part of the Revelation statue, the golden bear.
I'll be fine without that attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of himself, among other things, in the landscapes of Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norjan, has risen in his current country as a popular athlete in Norway, not least because in March he broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record on a 400-foot run by circumventing at 51.81.
A month later, he healed a 400 - yard fence during the Norwegian record 55.38.
Iuel, who is busy using social media, soon after his record, found that fame and publicity have its shadows.
Men around the world began to send pictures of their sexual organs to Iuel, apparently, in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuliel had to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "broken pictures" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to identify exactly what images he had during the VG interview.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to have a return after the run, but I'll be fine without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, father of a Danish-Norja.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When the Amalians were 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan because of his father's work.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in place.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship into Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel exercises with the guidance of three coachers: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than in the United States.
In the United States, coachers do not ask anything but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally engage with an athlete, said Iuel to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
The footier took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the risk of the whole career, now in the MM races, "It's nice when it doesn't happen to anything"
Now it's been nice to count when it's not happened to anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, which is the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has again enjoyed their beloved species this season.
Last summer, the career continued at risk.
The injury to the table had forced the ear to the surgery table in January, and the foot had no desire to heal.
The hand had hit the racing road, too.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was going to do, whether or not I was going on the boarding.
Sponsor-diles were off and a lot of things were open, Corpi says.
But that's what they say. Things are usually going to be fine.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back to the top.
After that, the extension decision was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, damn it, but this is so funny again, we're gonna pull it through a couple more.
The corp couldn't really count until September-October, but after a long break, it's been a big deal to work out without pain.
There's only a few races in the Corp.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the basket.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years for one race, and then you're in the heat of that week.
I'm tired of thinking that, Corp says.
Tonight, Korpi races in the halfpipe of the MM races in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Although the individual races do not hold him with a beating, he always starts with a tough race.
According to the ear, the ranking of international skiing union races has grown over the last few years, although some of the plates chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is big.
However, I feel that appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the races.
Corpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to follow younger friends.
I remember when it was at that point that everything was new and was so sick about everything.
It'll bring you a new power, too. Corpi's thinking.
I'm still on the chest somethin', but otherwise I don't, that's how much I've got in my pals!
In the background of the career of the boarding, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Pekka Korve's son of the director of the legend is attracted to sports: the platekeeper has his own nutrient horses for which he performs training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, it won't be much more time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at at least the diet results and usually something about the departures, Corpi tells.
According to Korve, cure management and healing are a potential career plan when the drilling career will be completed in due time.
I don't think I'm planning that far, but it's at least a probable option.
I'm going to feel like I'm studying it right here in addition to snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay nervous about time and evolve, and in the summer, I think there's something going on.
If it's my future profession, it won't be difficult to start when you're already inside the species.
Ravijuttus include the Elitloppet treatment crossing with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twins have rented a cruise ship that is headed for the treatment contest of Elitloppet in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Corp and the Birdland decided to revive the old tradition.
It's been a great deal of intercourse, and people have been excited.
Now we're at the point where there's no bankruptcy.
There's still a few months left, hoping to get the ship full, Korpi says he's excited.
Attendo's home project for Kite has surprised everything.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new catering home for older people in 41 places in Kite.
The building of a lot of 1,700 floor living meters will be completed next summer to the other side of the health centre’s neighborhood.
In the crystal, the subject of general wonder is where there are customers for the new treatment unit, because in the course of the Siu war, many private homes are popping a customer shortage.
The regional head of care services, Anne Flink Attendo, commented that Kite has more demand in the future, not only for options, but also for an enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, Attendo bought private treatment homes from Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerikan.
The shop was about business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease agreement.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland.
The trade union will seek confirmation from the directors of the McVitie's chef manufacturer for the long-term commitment to production in the Glasgow factory.
According to the Department of the GMB of the General Trade Union of Great Britain, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross Factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are manufactured by more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company owned McVitie's brand told me that he invested over £5 million in the factory last few years.
The company added that workers and representatives of the trade union will certainly be "relayed first" if changes are to be made.
In its letter to the yard manager, the GMB urges the company to “response to the concern that no funding has been allocated for modernisation of production lines”.
The Drew Duffy of the GMB Professional Union finds it very worrying that the factory manager does not receive clear information about the needs of the Tollcross business and the future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has concentrated strongly on the local community and Glasgow metropolitan area.
From the point of view of workplaces, wages and income, as well as Brexit, increasing cost of living and continuous reduction in production, East Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production."
According to the Pladis reporter, the factory manager had received the letter of the trade union only on the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed openly on a number of issues.
We discussed, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain companies on the market, we are constantly assessing all our business and business centers to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the reporter, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and improvements in its activities.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and we will certainly first inform workers and representatives of the trade union if we are to make changes to the operation of the factory."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up Neymar's search after payment of a GBP 189 million transfer agreement, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The Sensational Transition is the most recent case in the summer. The French Ligue 1 football series is ready to break the world record of the transplants. The previous record was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a 89 million GBP transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-employed professional athlete, as the PSG will offer him over 500 000 pounds a weekly salary after taxes.
It is known that Barcelona is angry about the PSG activities and the way Neymar has left forceful associations. The source near Barcelona tells us that the Society has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're looking for our players, we'll become their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the seuros.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have committed itself to this: it expressed its interest in the central field player of the PSG earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could therefore lose Neymar's star player.

Now, the calls that Trump ignited were invented - the White House reporter: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by the President of the United States Donald Trump never took place, says the New York Times magazine.
The calls made by Trump have proved to be invented, both with the President of Mexico and with the Head of the Scout organization.
The White House Adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls were made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto Trump had discussed at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, they were in face-to-face, Sanders just explained.
Speaking to the Scouts aroused the grievance
Trump told me on Monday that the Mexican president called him and complimented Trump's successful eradication of illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few people are going to cross the southern border of Mexico, because they know the trip to the U.S. border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a notice in which it said that this call had not been made.
Tuesday, Politico published the complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
On that, Trump ignited his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout organization in Western Virginia.
I got a call from the chief of patrols, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scout Organization informed me that he was unaware of the call from any of his leaders to Trump.
According to the news, the previous statement by the director of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked Trump's speech to be apologised to the Scouts, speaks on his side.
Trumpin's speech at the meeting of the Scout organization was a lot of strange, because it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he glowed the results of last autumn presidential elections.
