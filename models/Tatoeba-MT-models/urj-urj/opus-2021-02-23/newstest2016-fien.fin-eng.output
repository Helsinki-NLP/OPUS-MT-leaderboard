A 9-year-old boy on escape in Tampere found
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance declaration of a son from Western Tamperee with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and there is no danger of life and health.
The son's father told Ilta-Sanom that he was found by midnight.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the investigations.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo as a hurricane again... Ripped the goal break to the Messiah.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued its factory in the Champions' League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Championship of the Championship of the Champions' League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the painting statistics of all time when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of punishment and one game situation.
Ronaldo lifted his goal balance to 80, when before Tuesday the Barcelona Messique has 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been compiled in the Italian Football League Serie A since early, but in the D-section of the Champions' League, it started a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning painting made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juvenus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-born Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured at the valioligame this weekend, only came to the field with the last ten minutes.
Another company in Manchester United also experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 deaths.
Luke Shaw's guest match of the 20-year-old law enforcement officer in ManU lasted only 15 hours.
The dangerous sliding stretch of PSV Hector Moreno hit the goal towards the attacked ManU pack so bad that Shaw probably broke his leg bone.
Shaw slept on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff went to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but the joy of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno settled before the break with an extra time.
The PSV winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
At the Masters' League of the painting season, the A block began Paris Saint-Germain.
It was an Argentine Angel Di Maria, who changed the pants of Manchester United to the PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball through the back corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani did the second half of the PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been conceived with the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the lengths of the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Starfleet of the PSG, met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow CsSKA lost 0-1 at the B block match in Germany to Wolfsburg.
The opposition party immediately called for a break-up, the president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech as he had held a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has kept the same speech in the country's Parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe 91 is in full spirit power.
The Prime Opposition Party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because it's too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's presidency and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the economy of the country.
Germany and Austria want a special summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders for next week due to the refugee crisis.
Mr Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Merkel, fall within the table of the Ministers of Interior.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice is just a little colored university teacher, Shannon Lamb, during the emergency call, tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb underlined that his "Dear Dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contacts of the closest relatives of a dead woman were found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written on the side of Amy Prentiss' body and anger: "I am so sorry that I could cancel this lover Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," said the letter, which, according to the experts, was signed by Lamb.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesota's Cleveland Delta University, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to a school campus where the police believed that he had shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, told the university staff about the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while afterwards.
By the end of the day, the number of the dead rose again: Lamb committed suicide when the cop was surrounded by the bitch.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after the pupils and staff had to hide behind the locked doors because of the school assault.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but there were potential problems.
Students told me they were waiting for her hours.
The police at the Prentiss Death County, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book in which he thanked the "powerful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught by a social science and history institution with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the pupils participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but he said that he also seemed nervous and unrestly, "I don't think something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that she had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested medical leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's remuneration policies meant that although Lamb had worked hard to gain his doctoral value, it did not give him automatic career development and the assistant professor's office.
Director William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in his mind.
These questions will no longer be answered by Lamb.
After Lamb escaped from the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house, about a mile south of his parents' house in Mississippi's Greenville suburbs, said Methel Johnson, the death inspector of the Washington County.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught science and educational knowledge. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said he was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairstonia for many years to play guitar.
He was a pretty charming man that time.
All the girls were melting wax when she was there, told me now 40 years old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but their marriage has no evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house in the riverside in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together at some work.
O'Steen told me his daughter was doing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the last night before September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lipstick performance for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We've been playing games and twisted each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year student seminar program and was specialised in Indians and colonial history, reported at the school of English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and he had three little children.
He studied in Kansas Emporia at State University and was chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State campus, Cleveland held a candle training, involving approximately 900 people, including education and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mess during which the university's choir sang the songs of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississip's Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus Mississip's Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the police now saying that Lamb has called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb was referring to him as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for the holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the retailer of toys and babies says that the current regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to make more hours.
According to the company, it intends to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while during the 2014 holiday period the number of employees was 45 000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews of the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the shopping season of Christmas is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help them in the occupation of shops and in the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana.
The first night of the movie was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said that a documentary movie in the back in Time trailer.
The movie begins and I think that I'm just a squeeze and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the return to the future film to which Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd were interviewed, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and director of production Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future took its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "For me, it is no doubt the finest time travel movie ever. "
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD, and in some movie theater in October.
The UN leader says that Syria's situation will not be solved armedly.
The reply of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Russia adds military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is "not solved armedly", and the extra weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
Again, the UN leader called on all parties, including a divided UN Security Council, to join and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
In a Wednesday press conference, Ban told me that he was going to meet the ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces " has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and unanimity in dealing with the Syrian crisis when they agreed on the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 advocates which show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to stamp him into a windmill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for a crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to squeeze Donald Trump off the top of the support surveys, it has not been successful.
The last 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump have been in charge in the two-digit century, and some have started to consider seriously what this means for the title of the real estate.
Of course, the election season is only in the early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump would probably become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leadership to Herman Cain, both of whom did not back any state in the process of appointment.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
The external groups, such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation for Club for Growth, have, however, noted Trump's continuity and have started to use its resources to put him down.
The following recent statements of support indicate that the real estate king is not just a transitional phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have made a complete translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University's support surveys showed that only two of the ten republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says that they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In Iowa, the University of Quinn Market, last week, 60% of the Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of the Republicans said they would be either "inspired" or "happy" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "dead" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves mostly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent "inspired" vs. Trumpin 40 per cent).
Next is the most enthusiastic thing?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfactory" or "absolute" if the popular Jeb Bush of the authorities became candidate.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post report, 52% of the republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has an appropriate character for the president.
The survey of the Quinn market last week indicates that in the state of Iowa, the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of the Republicans think that Trump has the right character for the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent, however, believes that his nature is not appropriate for the president, and almost six out of ten believes that his nature is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the survey by CNN/ORC, four out of ten considered Trum the most likely alternative when asking who is most likely to be appointed candidate for the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball.
During the last parliamentary period at this time, four of the ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry was appointed a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any event, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, since the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey carried out at Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bushia with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's on a level with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were to be set up against them, Ben Carson would win a businessman with the big 18-point difference of Trump.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters in favour of Trum have decided to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure to say that it would never change its mind.
46% said that they might be able to switch candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at present is another unlikely winner, neurokirurg Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "raisers" in his campaign talk, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's ability to drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebuilding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, it is also Donald Trump.
The neglect of the government has risen to a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, due to a large part of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose an outside person than a person with government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
The two-week survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg from Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first presentation at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first presentation at the Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his choice.
The new leader of the Labour Force Party, Jeremy Corby, meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby is rising up to ask about his first six questions a little after midday, and it is likely that both the media and the representatives of the Labour Party will be closely watching his performance.
Corbyn has demanded this weekly show "small theatre and more facts."
He also said that he could leave some of the occasions for his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre of Trade Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the head of the Labour Party to stand quietly during the national song in the Tuesday Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the World War of Britain, has raised criticism with the Conservative Party’s representatives and has appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said his "respectfully unrespectfully" and that he acknowledges "the bravery of the royal air forces in the Great Britain Air War."
Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight, that he would have called the head of the Labour Party to sing the national song despite the fact that he thinks the King's House should be shut down.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's internal refusal to argue for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
BBC Political correspondent Robin Brant says that the costumes for the party's position in the European Union and the government's ceiling have also been "depleted" within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Centre for Trade Associations that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Secretary for Work and Retirement Smith of the shadow government stated that the party was "reasonably clear" in relation to the fact that they only oppose the government's plans to lower the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 230,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has encountered in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The head of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to policy and now tells us that he has "bundled" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Congressman Corbyn of the Islington North region has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Times is too contradictory and that he intends to abstain from both clever wording and stunning, but instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequalities and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary Angela Eagle will be replaced by her inquiry classes when Corby is not involved, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should at times be given the floor, and he has said that he has approached the President of the sub-room, Mr Bercowi, from the point of view.
When Cameron came to the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often combined with the Prime Minister's questionnaires, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since they were started on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important meter in assessing the director's discretion, the management of his subroom, and his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticised questions about the fact that they have become just a clumsy, which requires far-reaching reforms.
Descriptiond in Joburg: Non-home young people are trained as photographers
It's a difficult place in Johannesburg to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and earn living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and gain profits.
The BBC News met one of the first young people in the project.

The value of the GBP increases as the UK wage increases
The value of the GBP jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in the UK wage increase, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, with the exception of bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth target was fastest after 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by an estimate of the increase in courses.
Pounds rose over $1,555, and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct shares on the market and increased by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The contract would combine two of the world's biggest brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after a competing luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
The latest sales figures in Richemont were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 per cent after the mining giant told me that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating shares as part of its debt management strategy.
The shares of the packing and paper group Mondi were the highest players in the index by 4.3% after the Goldman Sachs changed their recommendation from the company to the "sale".
JD Sports grew by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company published information about its profits for six months before taxes: 83 per cent increases to 46.6 million pounds.
According to JD Sports director, higher wages can harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wages for workers are raised in the UK, it may mean "the purchasing power of potential consumers will grow".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill states.
The costs could be focused on the company's enlargement plans, and he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash starts a grass-rooted campaign against entry into Ald's sector
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA store from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash's wholesaler has launched a grass root campaign to defend the share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before the attack of Ald $700 million.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the opening of the first trade next year to South and West Australia, with up to 120 trades coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets confirm their relations with local distributors and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events, such as Adelaide show.
IGA's traders and buyers have jumped along, and brands such as Dunsborough's ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offers tastes in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to their Australian football games to their stock customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesale dealer of food, alcohol and iron goods is organising an annual strategy day for investors.
There is a lot in the game, as the South and West Australia represents almost 30% of the IGA-commerce of Metcash, and the profit margins are higher than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
At shopping in South and West Australia, visitors are well-knownly cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the eastern countries.
However, analysts, like Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first movements, which will be made available from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In his weekly report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually and Metcash can lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up next year in the south of 25 and in the west 30 movements, which will generate $500 and $600 million turnover in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash some $13 million of business profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent investigation found that IGA customers were the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales are falling by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share falls from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at the business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "may be lost in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the IGA market share has decreased from 18 % to 14 %, and Metcash’s income on food and food business that transmits products to around 1200 IGA resellers has decreased by 43 % since 2012.
The wholesale seller, however, holds its side, and has invested more than USD 150 million a year by calculating the prices of hundreds of products per week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA relayers to repair stores by increasing faster fresh food and bringing on a better selection of private labels.
Ian Morrice, President-in-Office of Metcash, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of shops have increased attraction, and he hopes that the wholesale seller will return to the way of growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been suffering side by side in a recent storm that has been swept around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennisional Union.
Cokkinakis, the youngest member of the talented twin called "Special Ks", was unwilling to be released in a case where Cyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in the fire fight in Cincinnat, the judge had to separate the Cocktail and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Even though the last time the chef was seen scattering his land after the cramp ruined his possible victory on Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a firm defender of the cook.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth from another place in double games with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semi-final against Britain.
"I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the rubbish," Healy said.
He broke his mile when he lost the seizure in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mile when he frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has acted very well, also in quite provocative situations with the US Open Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a fine team around him, he has a fine family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature when he is 19 years old, he works hard, fits together with the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he practises firmly, is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take into account the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution to all, but I still support the Canberra return to the team's vacation.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not around all the poles [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as for example Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public in pondering these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency situation, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia by detained those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of breaking up the flow of immigrants coming into the country.
On the border, chaos followed when hundreds of migrants gathered into a neutral area, and Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who fled violence from their home countries have now set up their tents and settled for an indefinite period between the two country inspection stations.
However, there was an increase in neglect.
As the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and screamed insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that it is impossible to accept the return of migrants from Hungary when they are coming from more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the border between Hungary and Serbia occurred after the 28 nationality groups failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 people seeking asylum, which have now taken over Italy and Greece, and the Ministers were hoping to reach a final agreement - either next month or at the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday next week, the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria call for an extra EU summit to discuss the continental immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The Tuesday emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases to be accelerated.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the aid on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up its borders against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
Charlie D'Agata, correspondent in CBS News, reported that even prisoners were recruited to complete the staple bar between Hungary and Serbia.
During the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival site for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life and that those who are fleeing from the war are entitled to protection - this view is strongly inconsistent with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight now define a criminal offence by the company crossing or harming the 4 metres (13 feet) of the silk wire cord, which the government has built on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for human traffickers.
The Hungarian Government declares the emergency situation because of the situation caused by mass migration, and the Government reporter Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear in this regard: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the military position expected for the next week, but journalists of Associated Press on the border have seen for days a heavyly armed military staff with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s Home Security Advisor, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempts to cross the border, and that they had already reached 15 countries.
They got over by hurting the fence, now being imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of the violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also shut down two of the seven crossing points from the borders against Serbia after sending a trailer covered by the trailer covered by the barrel to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near the Hungarian Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office for the processing of metal containers and the crowds invaded in.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands of them got out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main engineway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National Question Survey Hillary Clinton Head of Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit regime in the Democratic Democratic Championship, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be stalking him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the voters of the Democrats (calculated by 58%) and the second Sanders supports 27% (of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to join the presidential competition, but he is in favour of 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-elections, the majority of the democratic voters observe that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters are more firmly behind their own choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen with a number of population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and Sanders has risen somewhat at the same time.
Clinton is strongly in charge with women and moderates, but his leadership is narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's front road to the democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and now he's even with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in the double-digit century with the Liberals, but now Sanders runs this group with five percentage points.
Approximately half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says that he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely to be enthusiastic in supporting him.
Thoughts are more confused by those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, only a quarter would be eager to support him.
In which 48% of the voters of the Democrats say that they would be eager to support Clinton, the number one of the Republicans from Donald Trump says the same thing (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked on an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had an appropriate experience (16%), and the most popular answers were that it is now the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President has an impact on the potential candidate for the President, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him already in the race, even though a third disagrees.
When asking the democratic voters who they would choose for the second term of the party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Over half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidates of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden's source is involved, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voteable has grown.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what is most important in the candidate, they put their opinions ahead of voting.
Also, last month, no democratic candidates or potential candidates were considered impossible for these voters.
The candidates or potential candidates of the Democrats are doing well in certain key matters among the voters of their party.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's doing three best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters say that Clinton is not considered to be honest and reliable, which is twice more than Sanders (15%), but 27% says that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these points, about a quarter of the democratic voters say they have no opinions about Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server is still asking questions while he is a foreign minister, most of the democratic voters are pleased with his explanation and says that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided shortly after the daylight.
The majority of the Americans say that the e-mail campaign did not affect their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinions of him have deteriorated.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has calculated 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not considered to be honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of all the registered voters in the country do not consider Trum to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are regarded as well leaders.
Six of the candidates involved in the study, Bidenia, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many people have no opinion of him, just as Carson does not.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of the votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the foot.
Throughout the country, the Republican voters are still strongly in favour of Trum, whose support has risen to 27% of the questionnaire published by the CBS, before the Fox News election debate last month, from 23% of the questionnaire published on Tuesday.
But at the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson was well coped with different demographic groups and is outraged among the highly educated Republican voters of Trump.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichi of Ohio. The support of Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio are at level 3 at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 republican voters in the latest survey in September is +/-6 per cent.
Last week's survey of CNN/ORC showed Carson's rise in the surveys: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is above him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
When Carson's favor rises last week, Trump criticizes the retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died in the Brotherhood's Simputurereremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, the murder accusation has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi University of Baruch College in New York City cruelly attacked Chu 'Michael' Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and subsequently delayed his visit to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag of more than 13 kilos of sand, and then he was repeatedly stabbed to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood didn't call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look for information on the network about his symptoms, and contact the national president of the brotherhood Andy Mengi, asking for advice.
"That is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and in practice put the brotherhood’s well-being ahead of Michael Deng," said Wagner, police chief.
He didn't wake up, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated dull object attacks on the head, body and thighs.
"There have been too many families who have been suffering from the brotherhood’s apprenticeship, when at least one student has died annually since 1970," Doug Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, stated in his opinion.
Brotherhoods and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is important.
The great jury in Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the third degree murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, will also be prosecuted of violent smuggling and criminal plots.
"We do not want to be liable only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what has happened that has either officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held responsible," Wagner said at a Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College forbided his connection to the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The interest rate increase is coming, and the market in the rising rates falls, the profits of bonds are rising and the economy will have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past does not really help with the timing, which comes specifically to the economy.
The return has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first lift, sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in the increase of interest rates has often been, although not always, a factor in how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly the trend of the time to normalise the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
At the end of the day, however, the market participants may find that all the interest rate-related mortgages have been overrated.
"The first increase in the central bank's post-global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the "bad money" era," said Julian Jessop, the main economic expert of Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, to a devastating shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
The following is an overview of how some economic areas will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last about a month, waiting for an increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not that dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's increase.
In particular, during the last approximately 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days afterwards the situation is fairly even (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the leading capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management in the recent analysis of Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when the income begins to fall.
Recovery is part of the economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be nearest its lowest level in all times before the central bank's interest rate is increased.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increase since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only been less than 4.5 % twice.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, it is rare to believe that it will remain once the third quarter has evolved by 1.5 per cent, the Federal Reservation Bank of Atlanta reports.
The increase in interest in such a fragile economic regulation can be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time, Deutsche Bank stated.
The parties have been reserved for an increase in the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for a meeting of this week's Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategics and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade is only expected to be at 25% probability.
"Our research shows that from 1950 onwards all the increase cycles have so far been shown to have an increased leverage effect in the supercyclical cycles where GDP has passed its predecessor peak very quickly after recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery of a recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has expected the most far out of the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months.
The fixed return has also been instability in the event of market interest rate increases, and the model is somewhat resembled the findings of the capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are reflected more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The trend of debt securities yields appears to change immediately in the case of the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on debt securities will be reduced immediately," said Deutche Bank.
The Charles Schwab strategy believes that the increase in interest will lead to a convergence in the return on longer-term and shorter-term bonds, thereby balancing the rate of return.
High-income bonds are often better generated in this situation, although "we are still cautious about the search for profits", Schwab's fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones said in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's orientation expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the markets have adapted to a stronger monetary policy perspective," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is evener, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characterised by the market when the central bank has tightened its direction.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing worse when the dollar increase makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
The archaeology shows that the 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the first three months after the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover passed the low turnover of companies on average by 5 percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares made better than low-quality companies, with a first average of 4 percentage points and the latter 3 percentage points.
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in dollar value.
Savings can also benefit from higher profits, even though experts disagree with how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says Congressman Andrew Bingham.
Conservative secretary Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "conspiracy"
He claims that the separation of it from a commercial competitor will become more and more difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards target, saying that they were just imitating British Awards awards.
Congressman Damien Collins criticizes the Voice, saying that it's not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims the leading representative of the additional production company's pressure to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative Commissioner Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on its content and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "the public sense" to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Prize Gate, which was charged last December.
"The last year's BBC Music Awards only seem to be a British Awards gala under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different here, there are two examples that I remember directly when you were actually just copying something that we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC argued that the BBC Radio 3 is much above its commercial competitor as regards live music and the sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Previously on this year, Chief of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC supply criticised for the entry of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, the Conservative Tory Party, criticizes the Voice, the music contest that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often debated because it is not original and is not quite unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this programme of the BBC1 channel, where the star judges are Paloma Faith and Boy George, is produced in the real BBC style.
He added that he would like the production company to find success inside his own house the next time it started the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the forthcoming periods of the Voice, or to order that the money of the holders would be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose to date at least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the increase was low after the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may control consumption
For over a decade, virtual purchases have grown dramatically and have transformed many of the British shopping skats into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs of a levelling net sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only 7% rise to the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew by only five per cent last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling net sales in the air when the latest figures showed only 7% rise to the first quarter of 2015.
"If we were looking at the growth levels of the previous years and returning back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rational in time," told Guardian, Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index supplier.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people bought online and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it eases, and (growing) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been held as one of the reasons behind the slowing stores.
Experts believe that consumers will control the purchase before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the normal average was five times more buyers wandered to their computers to grab shops pouring down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made buyers argue about findings, can control the purchases.
In a study published by the British Retail Consortium, it was found that only about one pound of five were used online.
In the case of certain products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using the fashion chains of the shoppers.
Muslims bury Mecha in a lifting accident, the consequences of Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Meca
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of building giant Saudi Binlad Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that there were also 394 injuries when the lifted cucumber collapsed
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air, when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died, when the lifted cucumber collapsed in Mecha's great mosque.
In general, the white-dressed mourners filled the route to respect the first of the dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad journey passed through a holy place where only a few days ago the lifted cucumber fell through the ceiling of the mosque and fell over the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burying when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the building group of the Bin Laden family was guilty of a disaster that also injured 394 people.
The 29 bodies of the worshipers killed by the raided raiders in the great mosque of Meka were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton from Manchester, and he was on his first pilgrimage when the lifted cucumber collapsed.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the start of the yearly hairj-sanction.
Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mekan continues when thousands of people keep coming to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binlad Group should not have left the lift up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version said that the Binlad Group was partly the cause of the collapse.
The English service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s managers were banned from travelling abroad.
Previously on this week, Salman sworn to find out what led to the fall of lifts into the yard of the big mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the later in this month.
Binlad's Group has not published communications about the collapse of the misery and its representatives have not been captured for commentary purposes.
The royal decision also accused the association of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifting cucumbers around the big mosque of Mechana, which are part of a huge building attack led by the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arab ruler family for decades and leads to major construction projects.
Al-Qaida's deceased leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son forbidden by the family in the 1990s.
The deterioration took place in wind and rain weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the sanctuary, which each of the capable Muslims must do at least once in their lives.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
A million rials (174 000 GBP) were imposed by the authorities to the families of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that low-cost workers in Eastern Europeans are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores all over the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, city principal correspondent to Daily Mail
It is said that the British will give up their hammers and paints and rather hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home rehabilitation.
Looks like if you're clever with a hammer or beat to paint walls, you're now in a minority.
You see, the British hire more and more assistants to do tea-self-works in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at the prank price.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher is planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she would like more women to work at B&Q stores because the purchase decisions made in eight ten are specifically made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more women's economies where more homework is done than before.
Laury said, "The majority of our stores' staff still have men.
We need to find a better balance.
Nonetheless, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process."
Laury is only one of the five women leading to the main companies of the UK FTSE100 index, which has rebuilt its management team with equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with equally 50% of women, including its director and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - differentiality here is an important thing.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported the bill in both production and sale for six months after the group took the costs of closing down the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owning Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new movements
The government of the three aces decided to rely on forced legislation to save the economy of the country.
Even so, apparent effects were pretty quickly gained.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other employees' centre organisations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread expression of workers.
A little bit of a lot of people think that there's also reason.
Let's see if you're worth breaking when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already visited to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, they are going to work.
In old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declared as wealth would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people in millions of trade organizations does not take much moments, but it gives us the reason for thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the objectives of the movement, the values have changed
From an interesting point of view of the activity of Ay, the government's brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
As things have appeared to be rolling over the years with their own weight, we finally have access to this matter, namely the rights of the worker to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary.
Let's do whatever it takes to think about the activities of the organisations, so it's silly that the expression of the Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already decreased for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's heads.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranna: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduction of staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranna starts with the aim of savings, with a total of 8.5 million euros to reduce costs.
As a part of savings, the university will start joint consultations on the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means about 130 reductions.
Other activities are also intended to save two million.
The Single Negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which is expected to have a deficit of 8.5 million.
This will also be influenced by the government's appropriations operations.
During this financial year, the university will produce about 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly for the next year, but the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The overall budget of the University is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The co-efficient of the reduction in major education and research operations and corporate funding to our university is extremely important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before summer, the effects of surgery seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new scales.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last six weeks by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail transport is expected to be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is the subsidy of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After transportation, there's a long-distance traffic in place.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus's plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced interest in other international companies in rail transport, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The US Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow from the side when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
As Reuters made a survey to 80 economic scientists, little more than half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero level and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars in balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to raise, but the signs show that they also believe that the probability is against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology message.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting his colleagues later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "forgivable" for the first murder and hoped, "this could be canceled", the authorities said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier's police told me that Lamb, teacher of geography and social science at Delta State University, called an emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police need to send officers to his home.
He said, "He killed his wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "solid dog" in the house that doesn't bother anyone, but he's probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was a body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove almost 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed his historian teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killed himself late on Monday when he was surrounded by a police officer.
Director William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in his mind.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the arguments published on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "guarantee information or evidence" of any "threeodrama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple of them broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's gone mad.
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughters were "the best friends of all times."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand online from his home. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that he's not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb Road 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta Statesta in the spring of 2015, reports the credentials available on the University's website.
Stars that lost their charming power
The actress (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has been difficult in recent years.
In 2001 he was sick of leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors say he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possessions.
All of these really require their taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw got a double fracture on his right foot when Manchester United lost PSV Eindhoven at the Championship.
Even if the defendant was stuck in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play this season.
Hector Moreno's injuries caused a reckless strike 15 minutes after Shaw, 20 years old, had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field, and he had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing at the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penal shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian editor was wrong.
You can judge the situation when I say it was a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tactic.
Shaw twiittad as follows: "Thanks for all your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Concerning this: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June's European championship competitions in France.
Coach of PSV Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone's very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland in the 2014 MM races.
"Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's stabbing.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this could be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not last long until it is almost learnt from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service offered the childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children’s book, he chose a story of environmental protection published in 1971 by Dr. Seussin The Lorax.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book's story, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new figures and details were added to complete a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Needlle, inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams with the heart by filling Audrey's wish to see the right tree", the text says and describes the love story Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it had been taken from the Lorax film description found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins with the following: "In the city of Needle, inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is commodity, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams on the side of Audrey girl's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexperienced by the book's plot, a young, anonymous son will hear how local nature has destroyed the greedy, tree-blowing and accessories of Kerskane, without passing on to the story of a short, fierce creature named Lorax, who "abouts for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR mission is probably outlined for an assistant who apparently has never read the book for a child 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's reporter said the text must have come from the Cameron Electoral Office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think the recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut down any evacuation.
Alastair Cook's side may have less experience than a team three years ago, but it has good spinners and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in its spinning and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related to this: Adam Lyth fell from the British Cricket Team, he becomes Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging circumstances, and the simple but hard truth is that cricket players are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press, because, as I have said before, players are the best choices.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The chief coach in England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question how long the hitter gets to leave.
Lyth was elected seven times to the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and visitors.
The only subject of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to Caribbean when Lyth was in great shape, but the lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with you, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He's the cricket player of something we saw in Yorkshire early this time when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a hit-and-run position next to Cook has been sphered, so an extra feeder could be held, but I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the hitter couldn't be hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is a third to them, and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when he fell to the first sleeve before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a thief, and the little thing I've been dealing with with him seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his undecorated statistics - hitting the average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gambling, but there's not too many feeders and the electorates chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough increases on the coach side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter Mchain Jayawardene as a consultant for the games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games and brings with him both energy and unsatisfactory stunning.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, it was then playing or training, and he has the same horror to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the choicers do not make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
British departure from the EU (Brexit) can take profits if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-final renegotiating strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are increasingly facing problems every day, even though it would not even take into account the hearty Jeremy 'Is it yes or not'? Corbyn's choice of the management of the working party or of the madness of the centre of trade unions in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
Recently, the European Diplomatic Brother explained that since the EU is so deep in various crises, which are not all its own cause, some Member States are tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, which is full of disagreements and disrupting changes in the treaty that these countries do not mostly want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Associations decided that neither would it want them if they were to rape social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfieagenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local eyelid, and then coming home to say that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out inside the British EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with France", says from Berlin - suggests that the shortest ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they do not care if we leave.
Germany's careful and moderate alliance Chancellor Angela Merkel is a federal man, but he has been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his actions before it goes to ruin the same way as that of the stayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's the power to go away, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, a left-handed government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves for the selfiebrits, when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even plan to make consciously useless comments to the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 referendum campaign in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations had a case" and "Renegotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had a terrible experience of how the greedy Fleet Street newspaper is capable of being and how the EU-Skeptic press loners are not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio of 2:1.
They can bluntly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist, who made the name of himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as a correspondent in Brussels in the early '90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a booklet of tax-travelers, foreigners who hacking phones, and persons whose home is nominated elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same way about them, but he realized that if you were in a cage with a passionate gorilla, bananas must be surrendered because of the confusion, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more bolster than Blair himself, as regards the objection of Cameron's renegotiation tragedy, namely the principle of the EU's rejected constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgived him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I said to him that he had no more time to waste time on me) seems to be in danger of recognizing Neil Kinnock's 80s strategy, which was a mistake, both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he must develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but without doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC suite Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the United Kingdom's Independence Party of Ukip's military initiative and the arrogant nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly be behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-Fan" Benn said this both on the radio and on the TV this week, when his internal scout wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the harsh John McDonnell shadow government as Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father squeezed on TV trying to be unloyal to the government colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far to lose his dominant position.
Hilary's pinnings were more attractive.
But in favour of the fight to remain "wherever it is" - benn's abstention - was not what McDonnell said and, in the light of all, what Corby told the main gates and the referendums at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhierarchy, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to pass on (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communications is important during the era of the 24-century TV, and especially in social media's circumstances that are acceptable to growth for paranoids and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the support of the working party in the referendum campaign itself clear.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks that way.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's basic rounds on membership of the EU (and therefore in line with their Benn-intensive regulated economy and their anticapitalistic past) are no longer just a difficult debate with those on the left-wing makers whose narcissism of small differences is a key dogm in the study.
As far as he is concerned with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not have a campaign to give up) foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should either Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) in favour of the UK, when it can be completely in vain?
The United States is already disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, as I was reminded by the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the Public Health England electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency's claim that electricity locomotives are 95% less harmful than traditional, started with a meeting of 12 people in which some were connected to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts aligned with the evidence used by Lancet in its report on electricity tobacco, using the Public Health England (PHE) criticisms.
The PHE published this "virstant column" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published last month an editorial that attacked the PHE's main lead decision against the "normal hutera bottom".
Two other researchers in BMJ have considered whether the arguments are "built on rock or sand."
The European Public Health Professor Martin McKee at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, as well as Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, says: "The main principle of public health is that action must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's argument "the current best estimate is that electricity locomotives are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on the detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people developing a multi-critical decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with various products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have been financed by Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of the BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One meeting of 12 people announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received earlier from Philip Morris International, they will increase.
The selection criteria of the panel members are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also report funding in the field of research.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise under the supervision of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the director of PHE’s tobacco.
The study produced by the group "soundingly admits" that there is a lack of "controversial evidence on harm in most products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say the PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that the electric tobacco works as a route to burn children or non-smoking workers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE’s health and well-being, says that the arguments raised in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electronic cups are much less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who burned their lives will die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by the electric tobacco are relatively small, but we need to continue examining the long-term impacts.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance in relation to the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die annually from smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS GBP 2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - even though the electrical goods aren't riskless - they are only a fraction of the damages of traditional tobacco, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says the former Channel 4 manager.
Former President of Channel 4 Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "subject anything" from the hits such as the soap series on this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that the licensing fees should only be used to make programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticises BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to be smaller than the public, in a difficult time of broadcasting, against the most popular programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he came to Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that would be clearly agreed on non-discriminatory competitors," Johnson said to the communication committee of the upper room as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the fee is to be held - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and do.
The Voicea will be sent to the most important time of mission because it will be desired to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, that's ridiculous, that's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders second, no doubt carried out within the house.
In fact, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's a public service delivery.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010, led by a series of entrepreneurs Johnson said that BBC is committed to hunting the number of audiences "for the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the most popular series of BBC, which reminds us of Tony Ball's comments from the former Sky Director. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC would sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that "the public service programmes of the BBC's smaller public service are going to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC is thus fulfilling its area of responsibility and then, in defending 4 billion pounds of licensing revenues, can hypocritically state that "We do, I suppose, we are doing all of these unknown programmes that no one sees".
They're gonna put them on a missionary site where no one's ever going to look at them.
With regard to the fee, Johnson said to the Committee, "I will ask you to find a more regressive system in who will receive the most of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people with 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
Former Head of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its timely role in "information, training and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as training - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take models from Australia and Canada broadcasters and change the form of "information, enlightenment and entertainment".
As far as the partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said are only some on television, and to join commercial companies in such a way that they could all be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change their direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them with sound wavelengths.
Small shuttles change their direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse, which is too high to hear the human ears.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the performance of a new method called sound genetics, which allows the use of ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher of the Salk Institute in California, told The Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation.
The shuttles usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed ultrasound waves that then pass through worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ionic ports, structures in some worm cell films.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, reports published in the Natural Communications magazine.
In order to produce ultrasound controlled shuttle mats, Chalasani genetically edited worms so that parts of their motion nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified mats, the microscopes confirmed waves and transmitted them to mats where they switch on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a career-developing tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent from the optical fiber to the desired position within the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unacceptably, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using genetic therapy and therapeutic virus, the targeted human nerve cells may be able to instantly respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertisements may be shamed by the British arms trade
Look at the video against Amnesty International arms fairs.
Terrible killers!
I don't know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Grape bombs!
And electronic stunning lamps that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
There is no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parade produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British Government's willingness to trade weapons for oppression governments at the Excel Centre of Defence and Security Equipment at the Excel Centre in London.
Subject: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian governments arrive in London
With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared in bus stops and metro trains that require more accurate access.
"Requisite information, will you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18?" together, it is asked using the underground font and brand of London, when the DLR track turns into a picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route, and customers are asked to help stop gun fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Plans of Public Plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is six pounds packing keys, which according to the collective, "is accessing a third of the whole planet's bus stop advertising mode".
Transport for London is not amusing about this unauthorised "publishment".
One of the parodiamainos produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance fronts when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
The second anti-arm poster is greeting workers in the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook over 100 000 times during the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background reporter worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, found that the arms fairs were not advertised at all - and the ExCeL calendar also had an empty spot - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic, blurred corporation advertising, but "it was more obstructive to stress it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with weapons fairs comes from inside of ExCeL when the samplers sell fantastic decorated products.
He has revealed in his press release that he has received an order from the U.S. Army from the AT4CS RS triggered from the left.
This includes a "first-quality plumbing drill which has excellent effects in the back of the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight gold rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student apartment when I was unaware of 19, and then I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the people I've irritated and the crowded smiles and many, long complaints of others.
A large part of what I learned can be summarised into eight simple rules.
Moving into the apartment can be anything from nerves to totally scary.
It's fascinating to talk: tell me where you're from, have a mid-year and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just an yeast of Hahahahahaha to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire, and they'll share shutters.
Give people room.
Human rooms are often converted into cocktail invitations, cinemas' holding places and high places of entertainment, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.

College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place for rest, but many apartments form a culture of travel, which is friendly, social and that causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say, "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but now you have to leave, so I can get back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student's tired of socializing, and maybe send a message to the door instead of knocking.
To knock when it came up, knock.
One guy in my student apartment felt that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw some pretty stuff.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start at the university in the top season, knocking people's doors with a chocolate bakery plate and presenting themselves seems to be less strange, less "fare to the neighborhood, baking something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50.
Offering self-decorated delicious deliciouss is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will continue to link your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, it depends on if you know how to bake.
Badly blended flour-sugar-fat mills are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in students' apartments.
I understand that taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Why don't you ask the owner of the milk and check it out?
It's entirely possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more grown up than my apartmentmate that mixed his milk into the washing machine to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to be noisy so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like the pata of the proverb ringing the roof.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play a drum and bass music slowly because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music shaking, locking their doors, and going to a three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or in turn, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you were considering a cottage partner as your future spouse, beat yourself together, resign, and then see him every day, and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if a hot cottage partner isn't really your future spouse, you could even try to make sense to your bottom.
In that delightful moment when you find that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the line between cheating and temptation is thinner than it seems.
It's funny to play a good game, but it's gonna be canceled in a moment.
You can give us a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something, but never mess with someone's toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in the water glass that you then put in the freezer, but don't stick their property on the blue wall on the roof like twice.
A racist attack on foreign students' home in Kite - The house that was planned for the reception centre was struck in Salo
On Saturday morning morning, a racist attack on Kitea in Northern Karelia took place at the home of foreign students.
Unlike the police earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers but the sleeping facilities of foreign students already in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Evangelical Academy of Kite.
The windows and walls of the facilities of the National Convention were stretched with racist marks, such as scratchers, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation space, says the Itä-Suomen police.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher of the social guarantee training of young people at the National Convention, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities have been accommodated at the Academy of Nations.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in this messed up building have a-states.
Some of them study in adult basic school, some are in professional studies and some learn Finnish," says Luukas.
The status A is the so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreigner already in Finland.
The Itä-Suomen police are investigating the attack as a result of damage and breaking home peace.
According to Luke, what happened was held for students on Monday a press conference, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had so many decades of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens", says Luukas.
According to Luke, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been on a light passenger car.
I think it's a juvenile night of weekend, when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," says Luke.
A hospital has also been vacantated in Salo, which has been planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about this on his website Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
It's been filed for the police to report a criminal offence.
Adjustment 15.9 at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y train to Karjao, passengers in their nuts, "the idiotic."
The Y train passing from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjao stops traveling in March.
The news disgraced the passengers who rose at the early night of the train in Helsinki’s main railway station.
In particular, the downstream is hit by the civilian law, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's very idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and workers need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This cannot be attached to anything but political will or its lack.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming to the capital on a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined to a new R line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry of Finance purchased during the following contract period.
The contract period is changing in the course of the year and the routes to be dissolved are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siunthian, believes that the state's train cutting is a short-looking activity.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then you'll be repentant.
The Y train is also used by other than raceporians and civilians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Espoo’s Annina Powder was harmed by the train from the urban area to the distance of the travellers.
"It is utterly miserable for those who have to reschedule their journey," he said when he pained his Y train.
There's a little relief on the line.
There must be a new train connection coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the area of the Helsinki Region’s transport (HSL), i.e. take it to the Church Numme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year for the Y train, of course, much more.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions behind.
Instead, the number of train shifts is doubled in Ainola and Sauna Kalio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train transport from the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The train shifts are reduced on routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made per year in the day when the total transport purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State's annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
The Sixth Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeline book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The global crisis has raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final edition of Capital in 1867-1894, writes the timeline of Marx's capital in the book today published by Mr Hakane as former President of GDP.
"He's being taken more seriously than for a long time now," writes Hakanen in his predecessor.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and intrusion in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly far-reaching.
Aalto University professor, a valued economic operator, Sixten Korkman, can also be found on the list of authors of the book based on capital seminars organised by Hakase.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is the timely "you and forever".
But the CEO of the former Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not Marx, is he?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today social sciences are isolated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, an economic scientist, a journalist, a political agitator and a literary lesson.
"The common idea is that the history of the past tells us about the false opinions of dead men," begins Korkman.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went very badly.
Even though Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of the capitalism, Korkma wonders.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical positioning.
"The more important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing the interests of Marx, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, the world that changes as a result of a technical inflation," Korkma analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
And yet, it's worth working with Marx in Korkman's mind.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maoans and trochians and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today the debate is more diversified, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political load of back years.
"Every societal scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like the other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals to be judged in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Civil War of Sri Lanka, the news office AFP explains.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Tamilites.
In the civil war of Sri Lanka, it is estimated that at least 100 000 people died.
There's no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last few months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, and the UN report is required.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces Report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims of men as women.
According to the report, rebels have been committed to forced by sidelines and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not allow the establishment of a United Nations Court because foreign judges.
In England's yo test, it was possible to weigh social media.
In the autumn academic writings, Wednesday was on the turn of a long foreign language, the majority of which had English.
His skills in England were tested by over 16,000 experiments.
The test could have written a substance about social media.
Based on their own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the word 150-250 in English could show the administrator of the website’s advisor.
The title was the Aunt Dear Agony.
Aunt Agony is responsible for the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
She came to ask her advice on how to see things for young people as well.
In total, there were four topics of the substance that had to be selected for one.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses the third topic in Porvoo Swedish-language high school teacher Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a sitt from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was really nice.
It had to write a fire speech why companies should hire young people to work.
"One at least in our school, we've been trained to write speeches," says Lybeck and assesses the whole test as normal."
In the English experiment in Finnish - or Swedish - it was possible to answer questions about the texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of summer champagne to climate change and the processing of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some Russian students (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when it comes to the test of another domestic or Swedish or Finnish.
In the high schools, the test is normally carried out, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The student degree board invites the experts to find appropriate contacts in time so that they can get to the trial.
Even more time may be granted if you can demonstrate that the delay was not due to your own carelessness.
In Oulu, they robbed a trade with a gun threat.
The store was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering squad wardrobe.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against government operating decisions will block the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicts the police.
In advance, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Open and the STTK Alliance shall meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
It is also believed that the police are involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads to the railway are closed from motor vehicles for a period of about 9.30-14.
Only alarm vehicles are released in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off at the point of the Caisaniem traffic circle, from the west direction of Mannerheimi.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it looks like that's enough.
I'm not taking a position on police work fighting.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming to support patrols from elsewhere in Finland due to the demonstration of mentality.
They don't tell us exactly what the police are doing.
"Something is coming, but, in general, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police call for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
The Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standby traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With demonstrators from other countries from Finland, Helsinki is also coming with a lot of orderbusses.
They're not allowed at the Railway.
Basically, the buses are out of time.
Then the rest of the journey must walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side.
The flooding issue of mass transport, which is normally handed over in these large crowds, will now be dealt with in part.
Organisers have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of government counterparts to economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to be smooth.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," says Kujala.
On Friday, local expressions of mind are also organised across Finland.
On Friday, the expression of mind is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The large expression organised by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä emeritus Martti Siisiainen.
It's not a miracle that the Ay movement protests.
If it weren't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Coolie says.
The very rightful government has hit the core points of the Finnish Corporatism tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard choices are missing in contract law.
There are many traits here that ay-moving is really trying to get on its knees.
Also, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have all the employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep distribution that the demonstration of the spirit will result in amongst those which the ay-liike would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from each side of Finland showed their opinions at the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If you were looking for a reference point for a Friday demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, which was organized in 1993, says Shinyainen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorsta gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (Central) government struck from the labour market crisis to the point of view.
It was said that between the Finnish Government and the employees' associations had never been as bad as that of Aho during the porn government.
Now, the government and the ay movement may be even worse than the Murrostorstad for a while.
Besides, there is now a very porvarial government in Finland, says Coolian.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so tightly rightful, despite the words of the basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the stain.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day homes and schools.
Despite the undistributed support for employees, it may become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
They're all on the side.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish ay movement have been quite calm - even though the practices have been hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law - listening.
The demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of the property, says Coolie.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of the demonstration changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get a pig shit on them.
The fireman strike took three months in 1998.
There were also signs of strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical laws in the 1970s
The main strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal strike.
The Law was suspended by a draft of the Conciliation Board for seven weeks after the strike was suspended.
Metal men received a 16% increase.
The electricity strike lasted 49 days in the spring of 1977 and caused electrical failures throughout the country.
Murrostorst in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many of them, who had made the recession unemployed, met for the representation of the parliamentary house, to express their views on the work.
Firemen striked three months in 1998
The fireman strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught by egg rain during the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops" was one of the phrases.
Espale's farmers drove snow tons of tons.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn haystacks before the meeting place.
The nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
The nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
Some of the deaths that occurred during the strike in 1995 were coloured by the strike.
The attack threatened with strikes and the resignation of nurses in 2007.
The threat of resignation has finally accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors strangled 2001
"Doctors at the break - out of force" was part of the strike clause of the swinging doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and led to a rigorous discussion on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the bill, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students are moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marching for their student support in Helsinki from the Senate to the parliamentary house in 2013.
Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of the Finnish truck filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police to help out the backgrounds of the Finnish registered refugee truck.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with a truck with 42 refugees.
There is no information on whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
The people on the cold truck were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is at the scene of the event in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, refugees travelling in a truck in Austria became more fateful.
At that time, 71 passengers on board evidently died by choking.
According to the public service broadcast, the co-operation with the Austrian police is owned by the Finnish limited company.
The company conducts restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreign-fashioned, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Irakisms have been arrested for human secrecy.
A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug-driver and a smuggling businessman, a story of five smugglers.
Upporikas king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-ass cab driver.
For example, such people engage in human secrecy in the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed tens of smugglers and their "users", and the book The Travel Office of Death will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present smugglers for human secrecy, table proposals and present smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
The archipelago islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the tunisians are heading to the summer ceremony.
On behalf of their location, the islands also fit excellently for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa belonging to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a burning captain in the chain and a father of six children.
The archipelago islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir's done hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
After spending, Emir earns about 8 000 euros from one trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for him clients around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a large number of tunicians wanted to escape trouble.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis ran out again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will place them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given so that customers just survive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer loses the money, it is their problem.
We'll go to the water by midnight.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea trip is hard, and in 20 metres high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he's beating his clients and at least saying he's gonna beat the anoyors to death.
He says in the book that when the police once struck him, he threw all his passengers across the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I've grown to customers one by one, and I threw them across the edge," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen have to be assaulted by this.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
We have to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Bogovasha in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter engine is pulling the last one and it's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre without their family, men stay in tents, ornaments and abandoned cars, which anyone has found or built now.
Family living in the woods who have not filed a asylum application for reasons or others in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of cross borders and weekly walks in a difficult landscape, often in mountain areas and darkness.
Finally, when they arrive in the territory of Bogovasha, a large human secrecy point, people are fatal.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrians, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best clients are the Syrians, he's in the book.
"They say what they do once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to tink.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fools all the way.
First, the price will be EUR 300, then fall to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," she says in the book.
Goran tells us that he works cheaper than others and that he will only pay EUR 50 per person to Hungary's border.
There are three hundred kilometres of trips, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
I hear my colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about €50,000 a year.
It is not a big amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the short paths and takes his rides a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and shine away.
In the work of grace
A 35-year-old congolaism is called Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, with many believers from Congo, as well as a small centre to help congolics.
In addition to preaching, the Mission preacher is running a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He's looking at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He shines his shoes several times a day and ensures that the white shoulders’ rubber cloth is stylish under the low belt.
The embassy is proud of her new Mercedes, her terrace car and her three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and moves forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls someone from the Poster Senior's five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money out of your head and settle it with the shoppers crossing the border.
In order to get a refugee or refugee status to the Uganda authorities, we must tell them that it is from the war zones of North Kivu, for example, and that it has been forced to escape violence from its home.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary will organise a new identity for the client.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and the second one will be replaced.
It helps us with the contacts of the embassy in the Uganda Police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum application procedure, the NGOs, eventually the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refuge in Uganda.
He invoices each portal separately: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and moving to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and icefruits
Tom's a start-up smuggler, an ex-drug criminal.
Fourty-year-old Irish guards on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people to trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghanistan, a French cab driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in a human secret business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 highway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be put in jail for an illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs his customers across the motorway to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they go across the channel across the British.
Tom's picking a suitable truck... must be assured that it's on his way to England, and not even to Holland, and to cut off the protective cover.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into a aluminium foil, the same thing that is wrapped around a bakery or oven potato in the kitchen.
It's supposed to stop the police from spotting someone who's hiding.
Some use sleeping bags filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that he's not driving a sudden smuggler, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Upporical Turkey has been called the master of marketing and the unquestionable king of the Mediterranean illegal landscape, which is governing sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money available.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship fraud: Turk ports are rented with a snack of fun to take Americans or European families to a few days' tourist cruises.
In reality, ships will be loaded in full by Syrians, Iraqi people, Kurds and Afghanistan, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to a sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until they are ready to leave.
People get into minibuss and drive someplace on the coast.
They're told to hide amongst vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it's given, we have to get on board fast.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Navy Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers pass out and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about EUR 53 000 from one luxury trip after the costs.
He does not handle practical things himself, but he hires captains, recruiters, guards, accommodationrs and other smaller ones to do the work on his behalf.
During the summer season, transport is organised at least hundreds and Küçük is making millions.
He is thought to have bought the land, the pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party's representative and a drug entrepreneur.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: This book of Death Travel Office will be published, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner tells us about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, the 500 yard runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about the ending of his career and the ending of a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran in the cargo for the second best time.
But at the end, he was panic.
At the beginning, he struck to the top and defended his leadership on a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself above the goal line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had made a year before Sydney's races, suicide, and he himself felt huge success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of having sex with strange men.
He also confronted his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money in a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline pics as he had received when he was competing for sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published a article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world's statistical cycle at 3.57.40, but remained last at Sydney's Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the Alliance controlled the ski flower of Norway: "Superselling"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's skiing union have turned down the whole summer and autumn like last year's athlete agreement.
Even though the Union has offered Northug a better agreement than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplication of world champions and an Olympic winner.
The result of the contractual dispute, the Norwegian skiing union, decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
Astrid Jacobsen, a double world champion, received a decision.
He said he was happy that the alliance controlled the ski flower.
"Thank you for showing your spine," wrote Jacobsen in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The argument between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Northug, apparently, would like to be part of a period of national team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy in representing the covenant that also caring for the future generations and not giving one athlete on the solo.
At the same time, he reminded me that the Union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published his own release on Tuesday, in which he assured him he wanted to play sports in the Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as then in the MM races and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen, in total, won six MM medals, two gold medals.
Last winter, he was involved in a team that won the message gold in Falun.
The shielding day of the bakers will also be celebrated in the Northland
On the day of 25.9. there are stunts in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded a shield for bakers.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finnish high-level food skills and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the meaning of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that all high-level restaurants have not concentrated on the capital region, but that the top-level restaurants that have been checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the turtles and the organization.
In the northern country, the restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks is held in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town will attend the turtle day.
The event has also attracted significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Setting up the Kauhava reception centre a complaint for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in cooperation setting up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-varustuses currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complainant, the region continues to have a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, the Finnish Erillis nets Ltd.
The Kauhajoki magazine states that, according to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building block would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have an interest in the area of the former Air Military School and the airport, which has not been identified in the preparation of the reception centre, it writes.
The case states that for the last two years in Kauhava, negotiations have been conducted on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Ombudsman that the complaint does not concern the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
The distant city government dealt with the reception center thing last Monday.
Societies: The situation of Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that immigrants and people here have the necessary conditions, so the societies will comment to the suppliers in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in their office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern of the management of the refugee situation was aligned with all the participants.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
In particular, at this time, when we face major challenges
According to the sovereign, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The societies are hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the societies, the issue of NATO was also sivued in the discussions.
The President did not take an opinion on the situation in the labour market.

From the streets of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to the Union’s streets in the Caisaniem transport circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be released in the area.
Metro and clique drivers in the whole Friday's demonstration
Metro and tramway drivers will participate in Friday's demonstration from the morning traffic to the end of the night traffic.
The Raid and Metro Staff Association told STT this evening.
The majority of the Alkohols close for two hours, including posts closed

Media researcher: Sipila takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not want to assess the frequency of the repeated way of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated on the sides of Yle.
If other channels sign up as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech for citizens.
This issue, which we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
The pig's taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television talk is not about a more general government-information.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly and to refuse a public debate on questions? is Professor Anu Koivunen, Professor at the University of Stockholm.
The recent comment by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin on the fact that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of the democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not linked to each other.
The coyunen understands that the commercial media is disgusted by Sipila's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communication styles are not reporting issues in democracy.
The role of media representatives is to make a specific effort not to adopt political agents as given.
According to coherence, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special into the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak to a different tone, in a different way or in a different way or to say something new?
The coyunen says that if there is only more of the same old ones in the permit, it must be wondering why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this respect, it is a high risk if this is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is stamped as a message from politicians or delegations and governments, which is certainly not in accordance with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A squirrel bet from Sipil
In the future speech of Sipila, it is also important to stress what the Prime Minister does not say.
Tonight, we need to see exactly what Sipila is missing and not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Kuut, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipil, because this is how it can bring up its own view without noises.
This will bring a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipil passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because more precise questions are not allowed to be raised.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipila appears on the TV, the sweating, the shaking hands.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government communicates something, because this person is talking directly to another person.
This is the case (The President of the United States of America, Barack) and the partners are regularly engaged.
It's very exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo really considers the speech of the Prime Minister to the citizens as exceptional.
He said that in decades there has been no such thing that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the forthcoming blackmails.
On Friday, the employees' organisations organise demonstration and strikes against the government's actions.
The President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter, that Sipila could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sc.), again, announces that he is challenging the dialogue with Sipila.
We don't have time for the monologs.
It's about six months from the elections.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne's writing on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
POIKA's been smashed and in KUNNO, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finnish Police Department also confirms the case for the Ilta magazine.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later this evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks all the people who helped us find them.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15 000 times, which is an amazing balance in such short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildlife of young people: you are making anger
The Kurditausta free fighter Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals particularly to immigrant-backed young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a heavy speech against young people's street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving at five years old with his family in Finland, has so far won both of his professional match in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani says he's got a message that asked him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded on the account where young people fight with extremely violent taps.
My Amirkhan says he's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other side, and smash eyelessly, without thinking of any of the consequences of this, when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on the videos have immigrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinose, fight videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
That's exactly what you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, reminder of a Turkish Amirkhani.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite serious.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you'll be pretty long guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for letting you be here, says Amirkhani.
My Amirkhan urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become targeted by some racism, you may blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go with me, guys.
Amirrkhani says that violent activity will be contributing to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like.
You're going to be pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts his position on the savings package - Lyly: Decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter, that the recipient organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings made by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would submit his own proposal to the government to achieve a 5% productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium).
Mr Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest SAK to soften its previous position.
On the other hand, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in short words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open a labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by the active parties are needed in the position of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Government of Prime Minister Sipile for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
The Sipila earlier closed the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity gap.
Comment: The ambassador threatens to pound - "It's a bit funny to wear a fist"
Well, it's a little funny to wear fists if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary in the payee camp from the side.
Is the government supposed to be shouting to revolt, or is it supposed to be settled with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders had a saint hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close.
The threat spread to the undermining.
The OAJ threatened by closing schools and day-care homes.
Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK Organisation, appeared conciliatively.
He said he kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) for a five-percent productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Kok), the president of the schedule, has prompted immediately to announce that his piece of paper is already ready.
SAK's office didn't belong to any yards at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to settle when the federal leaders just on Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipila.
The right hand of the fire, Director of the STTK’s Social Impact, Jukka Ideus, formerly acted as Special Assistant for Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire is characterized by the fact that the government's ay-skills have improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but the fire exit took a little bit off the Finnish standouts, with the coincidence of the ACP Marko Pirainen (sd).
Well, it's a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duuma president, Sergei Naryshk, criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
In the opinion of the Russian Duuma President, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the September session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Naryshk made extensive comments about the July Conference of Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to the meeting of the European Union's sanctions, of the matter that the President was going to remind journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of the open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news office, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complicated, so Naryshkin continued to beat Finland by complimenting and complimenting Mongolia for "special organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and positively, unlike the meeting that was held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that Parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met a meeting leading by Ilkka Kanerva (Kok) at Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff playoff: "Present paintings"
Killpara and Luukko will continue in Haka forest today for bull days when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that the Haka metsäs today will not see the actual goal party.
Killpara went to Kuopio last night to chase a 3-2-foot win from Kalpa.
The rising was male, because the silver group in the last season was the worst of the two goals of defeat.
The lock Tuesday was more like a molecule winner.
The Iromaan catches were round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Tough game, paints in tight, if any plays the same game as last year, Lock-Blower Janne Lahti anticipates positions on the sides of the company.
The killer has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the creeps.
In the last two years, Tappara has just fallen from the final series of Luko.
On both occasions, a crucial seventh match has been required.
During the last season, the lock took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next sides and over.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, except in the case of paint vacuums.
The casinos who rejected both of you yesterday will receive a slope shift today.
On the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: The apocalypse is running a terrible play
Sports director Toivola handwriting an inappropriate follow-up to chief trainer Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky film where he was acting as the main part.
The subcontractor Sensationally put a heavyweight series on the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola handwrited a restless ash story to Pori.
Anonymous and wooden pajamas made a surprise for everyone at the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but stiff pool detectors like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Hopela was one of the heroes.
The manwriter Hopela believes that the news work of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who has just worked as a sports manager has built a pope for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have ruined the giants in the distant place like Rocky's pig carcass at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kupariis are worth some other than a linguistic game.
Hopela has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Sean Connery of the Iron Rock.
The Iron Kallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original session in the Rocky of Hopela.
There's no other name than Rocky in the iron calculus.
The game philosophy of the iron calculus is not part of rushing and swinging.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
Last year, the Ace Garret Stafford struck the Tapper Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2 plus 10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Collar put him in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an ace hockey, a hot-rolled Raud Kallio twisted after the game for the people of the Satakunta.
The team of the recent season has been oddly built.
There's juniors, veterans, cops, janitors.
There are practically no keys to the best game age.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the players' acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the procurement and unfortunately, the market situation was rather limited, the Iron Collion responded diplomaticly.
It's underneath the surface.
The yearly model of 1953 The Iron Collective is known to be interested in moving to Hopela to a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance in the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses in the range of 1-6.
Hopelan would not have been worthwhile writing the further part.
Olga Temonen is acting like Sipe Santapuk's mother.
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen, for the first time acting in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna You made us beautiful in the movie is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
The Sirkka cheeks and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (which is presented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of mind.
The more I've seen my true image in Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, spoken on the phone, communicated.
The circa has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
And fortunately, we also understand that the drama is a drama and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulaland would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really nasty.
There was a pretty small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth from Tuuka before the movie plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious sketch.
Olga was a day and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the highest level, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga said he's been working so hard with Tuuka in ten years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production team will go to Heinola for a month.
Although Iiti’s couple is often planning to drive home for the night because of their little children, the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have warmly accepted us, only asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
The budget of the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, guided by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Vuorensola begins to film the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's follow-up, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive film in Finland all the time with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously on the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in place will also rise after the Iron Sky 2 is completed, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa start in October near Antwerp near AED Studios and last eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare you.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I'm so relaxed about a fictional manuscript because I know exactly what kind of a movie should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, and he'll tell the evening magazine.
Initially, 8-10 million were planned for the budget of the film, but as the manuscript evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million could be embedded in the film because each angle and power is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loose ends.
On Wednesday, Iron Sky Universe, the film production company, launched a mass-finance campaign and a bond with an annual rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and by supply during the campaign.
At least two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The activity film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What's up? Or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the Trends have recently decorated the big logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsa in a conspiracy.
Advertising the cuckoo or t-shirt mark was seen somewhat as a junkie.
But the times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports musical signs such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness wave brush.
And as so often before, a funny and trendy border is shining: if something is right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
At first, the standard core practice, the tavis fashion, where the trend-makers were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey base college, it's already buryed on the bottom of the cabinet, which is in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas identifiable trackers, the favorite team's gambling shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
The beginning of the bottom of the cockroaches is now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from athletics to luxury bands.
For example, the breasts of Versace's symposium buffers make it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to introduce the logos in your dress?
The Russian policeman published the evidence: I didn't stick in the tank for hours!
According to the claim, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented the products of the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove Zotovia from the tank block for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be squeezing from the door of the armored vehicle in a very good mood, and at least on the basis of these images, it is not about falling or getting mad.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a battle tank, but it was a raid tank of BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in Ural.
I went inside, looked around, and I came out in peace, Zotov told Komosomolska and Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army TV channel, in his exhibition, the Russian new technology, because he was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I was fond of our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the editor who wrote it as a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and rotting, but nothing that I would've stuck somewhere in the tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
The words of Zotov support the fact that no photograph of the alleged sealing has been published, even though in a few days a total of 50,000 people attended the weapons exhibition.
The argument that Zotov was stuck started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told to rimp out of the tank hole while trying to kill and eventually threaten to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Mr Zotov, because of his size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way he sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

Food stores, Alcohols and mailing factories and ports?
The details of the Law Information can be changed before Friday.

Agnico Eagle Finland’s Kittilän mining company, which is owned by Canada, has been leaked.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand.
According to the company, measures to remedy the leakage have begun.
In the pool there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the vacuum process.
Usually water is pumped for re-use as process water or is managed in accordance with the permit through the surface coating field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the material came into the environment.
The leakage was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been detected to cause structural damage to pool patches.
The company tells us that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report, published by the International Monetary Fund, published today by the IMF, respects largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization was confronted with structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment security.
According to the Danske Bank’s main economist Pasi Kuopamäki, structural reforms are agreed, but there are little differences.
The IMF's assessment of the government's activities has a great deal of sympathetic message, but on the other hand there are also words of the warning on what should not be too much cut.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates Finland's economic growth of 0.4% for this year, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today that growth will remain zero this year when the new cycle is predicted.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported the total production in the summer in a small growth rate, says Kuopamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, there are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, under the authority of Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, started his work on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible successors of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research Analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to be seen by taking Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gambling consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
The Swedish Immigration Service already acknowledged in February 2015, that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their websites, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minors disappear annually.
Inspector Juha Kannelmaa, the Immigration Agency, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear from "lower country" per year?- In 2013 a total of 156 minors received a single application for asylum.
They disappeared from nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and they disappeared from 11, Kannelmaa reports.
In the context of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been found to be full-age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, the applicants for asylum in Finland had a total of 3651 persons, of whom 134 of whom the application was made because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for asylum from a minor alone.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is well known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have been given a decision?
Do they lose, for example, the "smart labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police, Kannelma, are responsible for implementing the appeal decisions.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered country seekers.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU Ministerial Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - look at the pictures of the equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's equipment for television and radio production has now been sold because of the seizures that have lost its ability to work.
Mikkosen's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment in Huuto.net, which were the most advanced professionals in his field.
The Internet report was the first one on the Internet magazine Iltamacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
The digital media world no longer covers television programs for Betacam tapes.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is reliable to find interested people.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these too are needed as long as there is an old generation of materials that need to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasms - collectors and their own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Storm East home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started a little bit of trouble inventing and looking at what things are being given up.
That's what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer a personal use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real lifework was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials in the box store from Stormskylä.
Traffic threatens to fall worse than thought: Metro and tramways can stop for the whole Friday
The metron and tramway drivers decide today whether or not they extend forces in relation to the Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the subway and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, you'll figure out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Truster Pekka Hirvonen says there's a big threat on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly squeezing drivers, so the government's plans to cut the lizards raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that stopping transport all day is a dilemma.
If the subway and tramways stand by Friday, public transport is practically almost completely stopped in the capital area.
According to VR, trains do not travel on Friday between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
There's no traffic on Friday.
The trains that left before 6:00 in the morning are driven to destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the fortress.
The members of the ACP are gone from work on Friday, from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven; they will be driven by the top, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo assumes.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell us exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employees' associations organise a demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Theatre on Friday at 11-13 a.m.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used tears gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border aid.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, escaped in the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tyres against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, 14 years of age, Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher kept him at school as a self-propelled watch bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to show him the output of his electronics.
But one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the youth arrest cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police, but it was known to be composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days in forced leave from school.
His father is rageous and the American Islamic Council is wondering if the case is another evidence of islamophobia in the United States.
United Kingdom on - Labour Director refused to sing the national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent to the monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also joined the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has been insulted by the people, suspected by the Labour Advocate Kate Green broadcaster at the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
The last memorial event respected the British Air Force pilot fight against Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroicity of royal airpower pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect during the national song, and the opinion stressed.
Corbyn's choice as a party leader has divided labour lines.
Especially among the representatives of the people who are afraid to expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, cessation of savings and increasing public expenditure.
Corbyn is due to be present today for the first time in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron rode on a weekly Twitter on the spot of Corbyn's choice as a party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and our family safety, and the Prime Minister was televising on its own account.
The cause of the family death of Minnesota is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a case.
South Lake Minnetonka's police have soon investigated the family death in Minnesota Greenwood.
A five - souled family was found dead in his home on 10 September and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife with a shotgun and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police went to the house to check and found a huge house on all sides of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a successful company
The South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses in the orientated social media website of AllNurses.com.
In 2014 at the StarTribune interview Short said there were four million different visitors per week.
I've been made 50 of the company's purchasing deals in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that the Short family bought a hulpe house in Greenwood in 2011 with two million dollars.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are only 12 rooms in the house, including a sufficient garage for eight cars.
The case is underway.
According to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering different preppas, had sued him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments were removed from Short's website and therefore had lost customers to its competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on short business.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffee.
In addition, the owner-thirds were rewarded by the Finnish Hippos monthly horse owner award.
This is great, Loiri commenting on his good-looking desk.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused with Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think that's happened.
According to Loir, the successful Shevose Coach Corpi will receive full peace with a horse in his work.
It's the stack and decide where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna keep my mouth shut, Loiri slut.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens’ superstar P. K. Subban has contributed $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the medical news, this is the largest athlete of all time in Canada for charity.
In addition, Subban, 26 years of age, is committed to assisting the hospital in another collection of funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with Canadiens eight years ago and $72 million worth a year ago.
Subban’s contribution is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars year-on-years.
Subban receives a titled lobby from the hospital for its award.
The players in Canadiens have used to help local hospitals significantly.
One year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same childcare hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s big hospital, which gave the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese coffee can order a wife's evening, serves only bikini and bikini.
The diamond cafeteria is a tough deal in Japan.
There's already a goat coffee shop, a cannabis cafe, a vampire coffee shop, a hut coffee shop, and now a wife coffee shop.
It hits the lonely, the creeps and the hunger.
The Metro told me about it.
A coffee from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my wife) can be ordered for a wife or husband's evening.
This is a waitress who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Poliso" will be selected from the list before the coffee shop comes, and he will prepare and serve the food.
The wife is opposed to just a squirrel and bikini on top, and a husband in a tight bike horses.
The website offers all the information about the length and pressure of the wife candidates to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep.
Soon, 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against automobile security began to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, the Intel release reports.
The board consists of top security experts across the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB research.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and distribute online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is a major component in the design of each vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
The Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in the processing of information.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as a moon rising.
Eventually, the car is starting to be in the vicinity of Finland.
Ford published RS information now when the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
With Ford's new four-wheel RS accelerating 2,3 litres, 350 horsepower engines in 4.7 seconds, it has a peak speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, it is originally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already orderable, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when they report.
The favorite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - these are the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish, it is certainly more important than two new news, the new Sportage of the fourth generation, where Kia intends to capture a larger wing from the ever-growing street shaft market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, created by Sportage, is rounder than before.
One inch has come to the axle intersection and outward dimensions, and the car is more efficient.
The engine range is mainly unchanged, but it has been added to a turbo with 1,6 litres of horse power.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported to be closer to the sales.
It will have to be waited a little longer, because we will have a new Sportage in the spring 2016.
Even before the year's change, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Quickly, the news doesn't seem to change, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of high-speed buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher levels of equipment.
At first, Optimas with 1,7 litre turbodiesel and 2,0 litres gasoline engines are obtained.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when an Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
During the same period, with its income, the sales of Optima-farmar begins.
Chisu came back to the stages and blew in a brave hut.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neckhole in the electric blue trouser suit.
The costume is beautifully introduced by the singers of the star's siro belt.
The whole is crowned by golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During three years of the break, a singer who became a mother has had the kg of pregnancy cut off with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really thrilled.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish a new and fourth album called Polaris in a few weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternal style is reluctant again... now you can see the chest.
The true-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics of each other.
He presents his pregnancy waist and breast equipment in hot clothes, last night at 1 A.M., when he left his sister, Kourtney Kardashian, a husband from Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored brass under the dress when lighting lights.
The last time Kardashian dressed up in amateur maternity suit when he went to her friend's dinner invitations in New York just a few days ago.
The chart was highlighted by the black overgeneration boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift was in her manner of pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Mano Leloup wanted a quick idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season begins out of nowhere.
Even if you'd posed in top designers' costumes during the previous season, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season comes new, fresh faces that compete for work with constables.
The models rarely have a place they can call a home.
The work is continuing to travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment to which the fashion halls accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop a pound, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion shells, models and designers are always together and operate as the same support network.
When the fashion logs run out, the difference is stinking.
The models want it to be given to this sector for the opportunities it offers, but they'll be furnished by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Even the models want to be their own person.
Work makes the models feel like they're actors with some role.
But you can also express yourself in your model's work.
You were on the Tory Burch show last night.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers reveal their designs next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulant musician in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band in the first years of the Apulant group.
In 1991, the lautala set up Apulanna with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rapist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to the people, so I think it's good to learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to do a human implication.
A man who can trust the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is completely empty, doesn't go to the role.
The Punk maneuvers come with the man in nature.
The stars, the stars, the punk part of the program, surely many saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been small, but we always go full.
Assistant Tuukka Temose, the director of the Bass in 1993-2004 Tea were published today by the main actors in the beautiful film.
The group of nuclear teams familiar with the band are still quite unknown young actors to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia performs Teppo Manner, singer of Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo Based by Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip on his future debris last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
Roope, seen in the mustache and the jaw beard, has turned his face into siloposk, and coloured his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or should you tell me about it at all?
There is no need to take this up forcefully, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises the psychologist.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and trouble, he says.
However, if a child has encountered a TV newsletter about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it should be said.
It is good to have a discussion on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that parents think he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare the child for nothing, even if you're embarrassed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel safe.
The older children are likely to encounter a discussion of refugees in school, friends or online.
It is good for parents to take the matter with them if they think about it.
The fact is that all people in the world aren't doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how our family feels about this.
However, in the end, do we think that the world is a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have a variety of educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from distress wherever possible.
On the other hand: If a family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

It's hard to control the Vermonic Ball Salama
Perttu North got a slice of Apila's Ball salama in the middle of the summer.
It only dramatized profits and second positions until the collapse occurred in the Tampere rays at the end of July.
Because the Ori was completely inclined, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian to his guard.
The explanation of the shutdown was cleared in the inauguration.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the weakest in the head, but it took two medical cubes to defeat it.
Since Apilan Ball Salama had to be undergoing light exercises, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE station in Turku after the Taruntuule.
Apila's Ball Salama was very pressured when it had only been able to drive for a few weeks.
These things, considering a small tendency at the end, were understandable, says North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made steel for the troops.
I'm sure the horse's waist went forward, and hopefully it would have even settled.
Apila Ball Salama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been amusing, it could've thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori has removed a lightning letter that the opponents have been wondered.
In short speed, turtles can't handle the Balloon Hall, from which even the warm bloody rides can be removed.
In the north's hopes, Vermo has a beetle run.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Ballsalama agrees.
It's kind of difficult at the time of departure, and it might be a swing under the slot and something like that.
I hope the Ori would be more calm than Turku would go.
Apila Ballsalama can also come out of the bow while in good condition, and we are going to drive it out of victory, coach's license.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs coming with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple intends to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips will come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a forced update on iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programmes.
There are other programmes that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating it because the company does not want to waste memory space on user iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area's consumer prices rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-years, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat reported today.
The increase in prices was lowered by cheaper energy.
This led to a slightly downward revision of the estimate of 0.2% for a couple of weeks.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% of 1.0% of July in August.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
In the EU-28 countries, the average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most from the euro area, i.e. 1.4% in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percentage increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year the rise will rise to 1.1%, and the central bank expects the new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed will try to blackmail monetary policy next
The next recession in the United States begins at a speed of less than a year, but surely within three years after the NCB Fed again starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And on the financial market, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rates should be started by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at the earliest autumn, and the financial market rate before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets act as they have used to do, and if they react to the blackmailing of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank’s Strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a survey report on Long-Term Asset Return Study on over 60 pages to its international large customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when the Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
On the other hand, they play with the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the markets have previously acted during and after the Fed interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key economic and financial markets are now in the same or other model as in the past interest rates - and possibly what will happen.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a more odd position to sustain the increase in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession.
The leaders of Fedi's monetary policy and its subsequent appeal have been conceived last summer and the early autumn to suggest that the time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Board of the Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds guiding interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular, but at the same time 0,25 percentage points of interest, which Fed increased from 1,25 % to 5,25 %, ended up at the same time as two years.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ripped off into a global judgment nightmare.
The major recession came from 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial market and the real economy began slowly than has typically occurred since the previous Fede interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than the 1930s ago.
Deutsch's strategics have screened the rises and declines in the world's major economies and the financial market turns since 1950 and in place since the beginning of the 18th century.
Since the 1950s, the Fedean interest rates and their economic and financial impacts have been cleared.
At the beginning of the recession, the first interest rate has been at the earliest less than a year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one or two years of the start of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has on turn raised and on-going lowered its steering rate to a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time, there is a relatively limited difference between some and others, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certainty on the effects of the following interest rates.
Strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Without the crucial causes of the financial crisis, the culprits may not necessarily be unquestionably identified even by decades of research.
But for the reasons leading to the crisis and raising its destructive power, there must be some unquestionably clear evidence:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world's largest central banks held their rates of governance too long in the 21st century.
They mounted the tracks of the technique, while growing up the next.
2) Over the decades, over the different parts of the financial and real economy, the debt volume of the central banks increased even more over the monetary policy impact.
The biggest bubble of debt was born in economic history.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing entailed most of the financial markets' components, which had been packed in the financial economy, sparked the highest rates of shares in real estate, debt books and commodities in the financial history.
It is hardly a very difficult argument that the high-level financial market for more complex debt deficits was rarely dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates upwards.
The financial structures set up for the debt lines did not last until their time after the interest rates had begun and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche Strategies do not realize what is going to happen next, but give us the topic of nuclearism by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and the other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Liability has not been crazy for a long time as ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Therefore, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but in various parts of the economy is now much more burdensome than before or at any time before the financial crisis or half of it.
3) Liquidity issued from central banks, which has been lower and cheaper, has mostly remained on the financial markets and has slowed down the key securities and assets most expensively before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only with financial market warning signals, they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the most severe downturn to the model that has occurred before.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks in the financial market are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is next to tightening its downfalls.
Perhaps the French bank Societe General's strategy Albert Edwards' future picture is not as strange as it may suddenly affect.
He has for a long time trained the bank's international investor clients for the following translations:
First, Fed raises interest, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fed's time to run off financial fires with even bigger QE cash injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), manufacturing computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are targeted by the HP Business Service Party, the company explains.
HP is distributed in November to the HP Inc., a company focusing on business sales, focusing on Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumers.
The staff of HP was highest in 2011, when he had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the single costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced to 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions of the consumer will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be low cost in countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is anymore responsible for more than 10 % of its operating performance.
In the last year, the three main customers brought 65 per cent of the result of the transaction.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system for iPhone after the Apple update publication
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings application, clicking "Universal" and then selecting "Protectual Update".
If the update is ready, the phone allows you to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the "Protect Update failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user in the end process.
This may include removing applications for the space, but Apple has reduced this opportunity by lowering the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes removable applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update, so that the battery is not finished.
If the download level is too low, Apple does not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery is running out, it may result in a failure to update.

It is also worthwhile to ensure that you have been through our list of all the things you have to do before download, so that things are not going wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with you new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and enormously new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that accelerate and correct the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has operated in the Government of the Tax Paradics Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Government of the Tax Paradics Company.
According to the above, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company, appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he left a notice of resignation on membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains will take place in an agreed timetable, Berner says at the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who joined the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was in Karelia-Upofloor’s government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs’ government and in Luxemburg.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs pass through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he received a member of the government at the Luxemburgi company, at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the capital interests of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company has no tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established in the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs already had a capital fund for the ownership of Triton, a holding company of Luxemburg.
Espoo opens the reception centre operated by the company
In Espoo Otaniem, the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers will be opened.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people from six o'clock today.
The number of places may increase within a week to up to 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree, inter alia, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work life blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government's work-life blackmails.
The organisation also wishes other staff centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently being given in the remarks of Friday.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s administration meeting on a break to the suppliers.
The Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economists of the STTK have calculated that the change security included in the government competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a one-off relationship to a hundred sides of it is a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation.
Palola: Consultation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has been hoping for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since the government is to submit a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to start preparing the reforms.
The Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is real.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive of him all the time.
According to Palola, the STTK Agency for the field is a sick place, especially for Sunday passes.
The organisation requires the government to retreat forced legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, the Palo does not provide for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the workplace blackmail package presented by the government last week.
Part of the package, including the first day of sickness, the overtime allowances are cut, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STTK underlines that the central organisations have invited employees to express themselves and have not been intended to strike.
The Open Fjäder Thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder thanks the STTK for preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, as the plan has already set out an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package because without the SAK, the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, president of the schedule, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare the draft for surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it has long prepared its own proposal for negotiating the 5% competitive jump pursued by the government as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for the government's presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, talkoos" plays bingo when Sipila speaks tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Vivan bingokuponki, the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Upper Channel on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for a previous talk by the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in the course of the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
The President and ministers then held a number of radio speeches during the winter and after war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho had a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train provider strike with a television call.
Alone, monarchy
Sipila's speech has raised all day's criticisms and conjectures about what to come.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said: "Sipila could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, people listening.
In Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judge condemned that "monarchism: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for them".
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipile's dialogue: "After six months from the elections.
There's no presentation from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on by the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the EC CEO Jyri Hääkämies.
It's a noble judge for the speech of Sipilä.
We considered the issue and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote the whole of Finland's comprehensive publicity, a line in the news by the Director of Yle's publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we're at the Tammelos
The speech has also provoked abusiveness.
After tonight, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be combed and dressed for the best.
My mother puts on the nicest piece of collar, and my dad's gonna settle the tie on his neck.
At nine o'clock, they'll shut up on television like we used to be at the Tammelo's time," writes Saku Timonen.
"Do Prime Minister Sipila also mention why the government of Finland is sitting in the tax havens of millionaires that hide their capitals, who are making laws for mercy to his other tax collectors, and at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by Viva Green Left at the University of Tampere.
It's been published on Facebook by a bingo.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries opposed Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the western countries rejected the Russian offer, whereby the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been able to give up the power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaar, the United Nations ambassador of Russia proposed a plan for al-Assad to be stylish after some time.
The Western countries did not, however, take the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaar, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in the two-way debate, listed three points of plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we can discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, Sit down, Mart, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he sent the message of Tshurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the newspaper, but Ahtisaare said there were no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused to take all the agreements he had taken over.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the British Ministry of the Middle East, responds to the speeches of Ahtisaar, as he has experienced that Russia was not at any time ready to discuss the destiny of Al-Assad.
Officially Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
In Ahtisaar's argument, I weakened the fact that Tshurk spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that Putin's shark would have held power in one of the supporters of Al-Assad.
The Running of Refugees Our Actions
During the negotiations in the Ahtisaar, about 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee from their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay the bill that we caused ourselves, the Ahtisaari will tell the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' organization centre in the penthouse of Tornio
The asylum seekers' organisation centre, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be founded in the empty building of the Tornion coalition in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsingin Sanomat reported that the Board had already decided to present a school building for a state solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hööpinen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, that is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled, and some of the teams wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
During the local debate, 36 were authorised from 43.
The Arrangement Centre was opposed to 13 officials.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, Poppyinen says.
According to the city leader Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and was rapidly responded.
It would be estimated that 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspecting that it might be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred metres from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
The Sipilä still wishes a labour market option for blackmails
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the pooling of holiday money in public would only be carried out by a part of the government's desire to calculate the price of the work.
However, the government would like to accept an alternative package with him if the social partners were able to agree on that.
Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament that he had not been involved with the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for replacing the mechanisms for pressing the work life of the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipila's view, the pooling of holiday money would be a tool because it would be targeted by almost all employees, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday tickets for the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present these views on next Wednesday to Parliament on the stress of working life in the form of a communication from the Government.
According to Sipila, the proposals made by organisations should be known beforehand.
And this isn't the end of the line.
Legislative work will then move, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long to see if there's a will, Sipilä shaped it.
The list published by the Government last week includes, inter alia, the conversion of the lobby and the helatorstat to unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary of the first day of sickness is cut, the overtime allowance is half off, the Sunday allowance is reduced to 75% and the holiday is reduced.
The reforms are implemented as forced legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, employees' centre organisations organise a demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the stock of the mahlahalli
The Tohmajärvi Council adopted unanimously, but slightly the extension of the stock of the mahlahalli, the administration of Nordic Koivu Oy.
The assessment was caused by the project being bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for order was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the sub-annual report.
The agenda was still talking about the investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000, but the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local authorities.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a lease, Vesa Västö (ps.) justified.
Even the Karelian place in Joensuu
The city government relieved its steepest position to bring the cattle-speaking street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of upholding the herd tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared to be the capital of the cattle language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the cattle is naturally part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more than part of the eastern savage fractures.
After a new decision, there are no street signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the language of the cattle, for example, in the information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-speaking municipality, it is also worth a wide-ranging approach to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturality is living and changing strongly in the North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specificities of the county, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used to make use of the various types of marketing in the region.
Train connections cut off the region’s vitality
Train connection cuts hit the county's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business and competitiveness.
And it affects whether we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights airlines, which has continued several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not manage to reduce our chances by government measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of the termination of these transport links, for example, on employment, and the Karelian stresses.
The deterioration of transport links causes an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in relation to attractiveness.
Of course, the better services are here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Director Jukka Mönkkönen, at the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that bad transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels much because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, the recruitment manager, says that marketing of the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in the cross-border direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently coming from outside of Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuus became one of my noises to the war of Siu
Joensuu City Government's view of the National Siu Sote project seems to be unanimous, but there is one of my noises.
Pentti Centralsalo (i.e., picture), member of the city government, presented a resignation of the entire project at the board’s Monday meeting, but his proposal was ineffective.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjai draft decision, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvolaan ends next year
Passenger train transport from Kotkasta to Kouvolaan will continue to remain in the future, even though one train shift is less than one.
Passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will be subject to changes next March.
One train shifter stays out, but five times a day still gets to Kotka Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to public savings.
The purchases of train transport for the next four years of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys livin' off the ground.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climb on the roof, who couldn't get down on the roof by his own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketoway at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two-layer wooden house in which there are no ladders to take to the roof at all.
It did not prevent the crowd of boys who decided to climb on the roof of the house along the masks of radiomasters next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the other travellers flipped out of the place and called the rescue station to help securely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx's operating profit is double, declining the outlook of the tax year 2016
The FedEx reports depressing results from its last quarter, and the supply leaves cut all year’s projections, due to the deterioration of demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55 000 season workers for holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 season workers for holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening time.
According to FedEx Corp, it is expected to end in May as a result of a tax year of 10.40 to 10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84, reported in the FactSet survey.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, the smaller outlook came in spite of the higher premiums for land transport of heavy or large packages that started in November.
The company said that it would expect business profits to continue to increase from the previous year, because they have cut costs, turnover has grown and online trade is growing.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "supports firmly, taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries during the holiday were published on the day after the competitor UPS said that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came at 2.42 dollars, which remains at the average forecast of 2.44 dollars. The survey of 12 analysts carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the evolution of its Express turnover.
However, the increase in online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the country unit rose by 29 per cent, but the income of the operations was in principle the same due to the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic fees, while higher labour costs were reduced by the operating profit.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening time, FedEx's shares fell to $3.85, which is 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent below the 11th of June record.
The US Central Bank decision-makers will sit this week for two days around the giant mayonnaise table in the long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time to almost a decade.
On the other side of the central bank's decorative two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map reminds us that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Congress has given the central bank two responsibility: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the heads of the central bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the information indicates that the economy is growing firmly, recent droughts in the global financial markets may have made the already precarious NCB officials more frightened as to increase instability, and it is feared how it would affect the increase in the federal fund rate at least in a quarter.
"Intelligently, labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a major economic expert in Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for leaving the level of interest, there is an increased uncertainty in the world market that is sufficiently qualified for waiting yet," he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which already leads to nervousness in the economy.
According to the recent study of Bloomberg, approximately half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
The financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that there is only about 30% of growth.
This refers to the decline in the securities market if the central bank increases the level unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the attack by promiseing that the next lift will not take place in the near future.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599.85.
The expectation that the central bank maintains the level this week was accompanied by the recovery, reports John Lonski, the main economic expert of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest, "they must have a great deal of effort in their direction to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that the increased level would reassure the financial market because it would eliminate uncertainty about the time when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago it seemed that the central bank would increase the interest rate this month by one quarter, thus taking the first small step towards slow blackmailing the financial situation, which would confirm the stability of the United States' recovery.
In spring and from the beginning of summer, he has observed that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the need for further economic development by the Liberals in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest number for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of stimulation.
Although inflation is still below the annual objective of the Central Bank of 2%, the NCB’s decision-makers believe that this will have a significant temporary impact on the price of low oil.
The economy "maintains higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the strict situation in the labour market", says Pantheon Macroeconomics, the main economic expert of Ian Shepherdson.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalved its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record, when investors were afraid that the Chinese slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 per cent below the male peak figure.
For CB decision-makers, market failure is an additional factor in a complex equation which states that the interest rate should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks on the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they do not have much information about the consequences of the Chinese events", says Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the ECB's influence has been tremendous.
In 2013, the President-in-Office, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could "develop" the increase in the amount of money, resulted in distortions on the market around the world.
In the world where markets and economies are increasingly blurred, officials of the central bank are expected not only to develop elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, Head of the global strategy of the Asset Management Company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank), located in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted its financial markets, which has appeared to be separated from the basic economic factors."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has decided, has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings, "without the limited, identifiable effects on the United States' economic growth", Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank revoked these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as was the case when the markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the former member of the Bank of England's interest rate determination committee.
The last assault isn't even close to its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where interest rises is feared because the markets are harmed," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Law of the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) still holds a two-like requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I believe they should not expect it.

The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization, SPRS, has developed a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good food during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
The breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide the babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories with about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that the increase in calorie is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
The recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was shown to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is the favorite viewers in the range, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to news the leader display in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's assault on Canberra's news of the exploration of the Liberal Party's leaders failed to increase today's number of viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull dismantled Tony Abbott.
The contestable program of Sunrise, led by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped in London as part of its weekly series of international broadcasts covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara's falls and Cancun.
The distance cargo did not seem to interfere with Australian TV viewers, because the average viewer value of Sunris was 397 000 in 5 state capitals, while today's figure was 339 000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise in the last few months.
In August today's average was 318 000 and Sunris 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, the average number of Sunris is 349 000, while today's number is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in winds are blowing this morning outside Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 series of words, which presents the former Packed to the Rafters series of stars Erik Thomson, a marvelous premiere.
A new drama series that gathered a very impressive average of 1,219 million viewers reports of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have been wondering if the Thomson-favorite series is the only force to carry without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
The The X Factor programme of Seven was a strong 1,136 million viewers, winning easily the Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726 000).
The Seven Channel had a double fate on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new philosophy programme gathered 446 000 viewers on average.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour number was dizzy 720 000.
The average hot Seat was 620 000.
The Chase Australia’s average number of viewers in the second night brings confidence in the Nine channel that at the end of the Hot Sea will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme that failed to reduce the number of viewers of the McGuire programme.

The final triangle agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The remaining three girls aren't really gonna drop who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before three became two, they could, however, deliberately, give a clue to the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed before Thursday's finale.
All three women threw themselves into poetry telling us how Wood is a perfect man, referring to his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness for the reasons why they would like to be his partners.
However, when they were asked, If the last rose of Wood is not to you, who should it go to? their answers could offer a proof of who won the son's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been incomplete since the first day.
"After I walked into the house, (Sarah) the energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind all the time," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really on the ground, it's fun to be with him," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel nice and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good partner.
Mackay said last week's visits made him realize that Wood could be "that's right."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with my whole heart in this," he said.
When you ask who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls left as much as I like, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. on Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coachs would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the end of the game after the Australian Rugbyligan turnover dropped the ball when the first swing was returned to the team when the team was won in Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next flight and took him to the run game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's real character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new new enthusiasm a battalion in front of another team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Mr. Jarryd Hayne dropped the explosion Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man to NFL Debyy.
Haynen was seen cursed on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pairing Hamish & Andy about the 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 10.4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start of his NFL career.
"It was now just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her oxygenation to her 2007 Origin debut when the feed led to Queensland's goal in his own paint area.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photograph published in his Instagram account, holding the Australian flag with the fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a weapon threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when the police shot rubber bullets against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old sons, died in Nepal, South, when a policeman shot rubber bullets into a crowd that expressed his view against the new Constitutional proposal in the country, on Wednesday the authorities reported.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandusta.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the senior official of the region, said that over 1,000 demonstrators had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tears gas and then fired the air before using rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians got hurt, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous option appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the recent weeks of violent demonstrations, there was a merger across the southern provinces of Nepal, where the members of the Etnical Group of Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in the West Nepal when the Tharus group calls for its own country.
After August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of which have been cops.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement on the distribution of the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards the new Constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed by the devastating earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted this week on the constitutional clauses of Katmandussa, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been approved by Sunday.
The US National hurricane Centre NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane
On the low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southern part of the Cape Verde island group, 60% of the chance to develop a tropical hurricane during the next 48 hours was reported by the US National hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
The second specific low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical cycling storm over the next two days, added the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google will start the donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees in Europe fleeing from war-breaking and poverty countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its blog of the donation campaign.
Instead of reporting from the Director, the Google worker Rita Masoud, who escaped from Kabul with his family when he was seven years old, wrote about his personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the crisis of refugees and immigration in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Gifts will receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, save children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it corresponds with the same amount to every donation made worldwide on the Google.com/refugeerelief site, up to 5.5 million dollars, with a total target of USD 11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been going on since World War II, which is mainly due to the four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dilution surgery can help mildly obese diabeteses
According to the new study, the benefits of a mildly obese type 2 diabetes mellitus surgery may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to tell if these mildly obese diabeteses live after dialect surgery longer than those treated in other ways than by surgery.
Dr. Robin Blackstone says: "To obtain mortality information takes a long time," she is a diagnosis specialist who wrote a headline in a new JAMA Surgery magazine.
Dilution or bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery have been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved have been ill fat and their body weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the person's BMI is more than 30, he is considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in Taiwanian Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatrist surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and a reduction in gastrointestinal gastrointestinal treatments, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI for cut persons fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained mostly the same in 29.
36% of the cut persons had a full improvement and 28% partially improved diabetes.
Due to comparative treatment, diabetes was fully improved by only 1% and partially by approximately 2% in the drug-treated group.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the bad LDL cholestero "were generally better in the surgery group", the writers said.
Investigators also monitored the levels of haemoglobin A1c in patients reflecting blood sugar levels in the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7% by researchers.
Following surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the pharmaceutical group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this better "glycaemic control", described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between the two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared with the abdominal cavity surgery group, the group in the gastrointestinal surgery had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and had more likely achieved a complete diabetic remission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that even though the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life in more severe people.
In a Swedish study, it was found that overdrug fattening in the dialect surgery was 29% less likely to die during a period of 15 years compared to a group that had been experimenting with more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 and interested in surgery.
"The results of the investigation are crucial just in showing that the surgery is safe for the lower body weight index", he says, and there is no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time of the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," she says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw.
"Not all can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Mr Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The Head of the Buddhist of Tibetan has called for the abolition of violence in the countries of refuge.
Dalai Lama dealt with the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, which was dedicated to ethics research.
In the present situation, Dalai Lama argued that the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also underlined that although the answer of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, it is necessary to consider long-term solutions: how real peace and real development can be brought into these Muslims, mainly through education.
The ultimate point is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
When taking a position on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response in the United States caused serious events in the chain.
"After the 9-11 Father, in my letter, I congratulated President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used the power and it created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Over the last four years, the swallowing of the child’s hand-infectant has increased to four times
The toxicological data centres across the United States have reported a strong increase of almost 400% in the swallowing of an alcoholic hand-infuse agent for children under the age of 12 years since 2010, reports Georgia’s toxicological information centre.
According to PhD Gaylord Lopez, the director of the toxicological information centre of Georgia, the cases reported in the toxicological data centres for the swallowing of disinfectant in children under 12 years of age rose from the case in 2010 to the case in 2014 16117.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them will be sent to the emergency police," said Lopez to CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap rise.
According to the reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to make a stronger drink.
The fragrances of the pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think it's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those that have been added to.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", head of the University of Kansas Medical Centre, Mr Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey stick on the table, but the hand disinfectant is kept visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who, some time ago, swallowed only four strawberries of strawberries in a school of hands, and was taken to first aid.
Her blood levels of alcohol were 179, which is twice the limit of adult drinking, Chris Ritchey, first-aid clinic, who treated her at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When you were talking to Nhaijah, she couldn't walk when she arrived for an emergency.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital for possible cerebral injuries, because alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," said Nhaiyah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are combined with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a toxic, unannounced ingredient containing hand disinfectant.
Health authorities assume that the product contains a methanol, a lethal substance, and not a ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bacterial" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant of the hands and denied it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan from being a "fun" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Huhumylly: There are no contradictions in Celtic
The Griffiths are declining talks about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops are in a tight place, but he'll make it turn around.
Hearts fights against the Scotland Football Alliance for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is alert to the January recruitment that could disturb the team's unity.
Dons raised his leadership to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time punishment took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodrien's stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference between Celtic to five points.
Griffiths deciding on contradictions.
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal contradictions, but Griffiths passed them right away, and he claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under a more accurate eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The absence of the Scottish Championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers' Central Field Player and former Dutch team member Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the Championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "The administration no longer shows the highlights of Celtic's games and why?"
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here can't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
These teams have many tensions, and the non-Scotlandians want to follow them.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
Lose Malmölle and the resulting drops from the Masters League quickly followed the loss of a ten-man Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with a difference of five points to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad episodes before, and we'll get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
That's what we are, too, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is being watched for the January Player Transfers
Although Rangers-Pomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible targets of January's players transfers, he's careful about the recruitment's least, insisting that he doesn't want to mix the team's unanimity.
The former boss of Brentford said, "January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players coming in the summer, the time of adaptation is all over the time, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in retirement Michu
The attacker in Swansea Michu, whose name was attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swans has ended.
A 29-year-old player has had an ankle for two years, and during the summer he failed to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scotland Football Alliance for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defendant's red card was revoked later, and this was in the last eight months already the third Collum condemned the red card that was revoked.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded by singing an offensive song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at the Roseburn in Edinburg, before Edinburg's derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment of mentality", the attacker said, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
The Tannadice Government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Government still has faith in the leaders' ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakness of players has to stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in order," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the "Fast Victory" in the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but he managed to achieve his seventh successive league victory, which lifted them up to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a pocal or a league that would not have won games in this way."
Scotland unemployment remains the same as the increase in the United Kingdom’s total number
THE WORK IN Scotland remained 164 000 in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Britain rose to 1.82 million in the total of 10,000 people.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than 5.5 per cent in Britain, according to the National Statistical Centre (ONS) figures.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people during the three-month period, and the number of employees is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the average rate in Britain by 73.5%.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of administration is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost a precise year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has declined.
Why am I witnessing the execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, then today I will see when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting at the watchers' magazine at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've been starting to creepy this day as it approaches.
So why did I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through terrible dignity.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to twelve.
Whoever's chosen is looking at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossippi, and I have also made my contact with him through the calls made over the months and one two and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to save what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma in Twitter accused me of imposing my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner in the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He acknowledged that "the word could have been better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international reporter who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the direction against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I'm doing.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him guilty of assistance anyway.
But I believe that there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I'm sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the angle I'm looking at when he dies.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists here who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it feels like to look at when a man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was dragged out of the Canning River after a water police hunt.
Canning Valen's officer stayed dry when he dragged a man away from the Canning River River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to deceive the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in a low, muddled water just a few feet from a policeman who tried to "reduce him gentlely back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of the unauthorised intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this was trying to distract them by heading to the Canning River River.
However, he did not get too far.
"He stood in the water saying, "I will not come away, come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to be wet, so he used a safer tactic: "Dear police negotiations."
"Something people do funny things while trying to escape," said Sergeant Castledine.
The master's football player Ben Cousins is a impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and trying to swim across the Swan River.
He failed his business, but inspired the locals to begin the design of a playful Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
Peter Moody claims journalists tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria's suppliers tried to infiltrate their vacancies into his deposits last year and threatens to stop competition immediately.
He accuses journalists and Racing Victoria's Incorruption Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment of the day of the race was the last stamp.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has suffered a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue in control for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and for a long time I've been silent about it, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that all will be unloaded at once," Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and sleeping well.
I want to go up my head and I want the owners to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I should no longer be coached.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb at the racing.com site interview where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
Thirteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man and I'm gonna name him when he asked, and they offered him a job on my deposit if he gave me information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a scam.
If that's the case, they should probably separate their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear then and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking it's gonna be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to male and perhaps transfer responsibility to non-trainers about what is going on in the field?
Am I injured?
Am I so uncomfortable?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me away, and I do not doubt that things that I have said might make them think exactly that.
But I'm at that point that I don't care anymore, and it's sad for me.
It really hurts me.
I press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with a long-term Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection has led him to say that he could "vise his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the unprofitable master Black Caviar, has called the rule on the treatment measures for the race day to be "smart" after the mud or clay hat has been placed in the horse's legs, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to mud it into his leg.
It could have had a hawk last night.
It could have had it last night, just like it was.
It was the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race due to the application of the day, from which the suppliers initiated the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, arrested by the driver who has been forced to transport
The police have arrested a man who was convicted of traffic escape after hitting a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
The biker was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by airway after he got serious injuries when the car ran into him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and stopped to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia registered himself to a police officer in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of neglecting assistance and of other traffic violations.
The bike driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Mr. Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
Mr. Melbourne Storm, coach Craig Bellamy, has criticised the arguments of the two NRL-rugbyliga champions that his team's tacklings are part of the line.
Coach Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson said that the resignation judges allowed Storm's "pain" on their side when he suddenly won the final carnation in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely covering his reference to Storm after he won North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals.
Bellamy defended his team's tacks and said that they were just focusing on "contact".
Bellamy added that his trust was increased by two leading coach criticisms against Storm, because it means they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This always comes to talk - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost them 24-2," said Bellamy Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques all year, and in the last six weeks, we've just stressed our contact in the stairs, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes to talk at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "responsive rugby" by reminding her of the mentor of the fact that the St George Illawarra Dragons, who was trained by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "greatly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare Saturday night's game to our Friday night's game and tell me how exciting their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing a rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its kind of players.
He brought out that side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'll be more confident when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as an opposition to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than that played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more paints, but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting defense line breaking and not making the goal?
For me, this is about directions.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm will be free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night's prefinal at AAMI Park.
$200 000 guarantees for a Serb man for a drug charge.
A man who threatens a lifetime of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggling to Queensland has been released against the guarantee amount of $200 000.
Marko Maksimvic, 29 years old, is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay Hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu, and shipped into Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the boat harbour all morning, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse café, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens the potential lifetime of a cocaine holding company for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the whole amount and that he could be in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, Judge of the Supreme Court, was concerned that Maxiovic was trying to escape.
"He has solid connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maxiovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a guarantee amount of $200 000 to ensure his exemption.
"After reading the testimony of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of $200 000 is a real economic burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to stop him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he would give up both Australia and Serbia's passports, report to the police every day and hold on to his ban on the outdoor movement between 6:00 and 6:00 in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to attract pedofils to send pictures.
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of children's abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while he was sleeping on this phone and then logged in to the online communication service where Hogg received a number of unsolicited pictures of the children that another user sent him.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl studied her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately told her about it.
When the police came to see five pictures, investigate the computers on the ground, and find "surprising" online searches on searchwords that were used to look for unsweeted images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that he had done this "to attract pedofils" on the Internet before he would pretend to be a cop to scare them."
Mr Eilidh Robertson, Mr Fiscal Depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that it was an addiction - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had done his graves on the computer but said they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedofils.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent him the photos, and about the time Hogg asked him to send him some more photos.
Hogg said it was just for bait purposes.
He said that after he had a drink, he'd get sick, and he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she screamed to her mother, she shaked and cried.
My mom saw the pictures on the phone, and then she met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked like her younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg in Dundee in Ward Road admitted to the charge of preparing or taking pictures of unconscious children on the 14th June of last year. He broke the guarantee on 25 January of this year and refused to come to court on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be recorded in the register of sexual offences because it can be argued that his crime was not a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to allow the social action to have time to produce the background reports.
Hogg was given warranty in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to the sexual criminal records before the judgment date.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has made the wrong speech to Parliament
Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the speaker's highway.
He wasn't injured, but the video of the fall was spread like a virus in social media.
The Parliament's openings also advocated the opposition legislators' statements that they had been sent with anonymous threats of killing in which they were warned that they would not be bummed to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bungled him and interrupted him with intermediate crystals when he kept a talk about the state of the country to the House - what he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democrat Change (MDC) group discipline overseer Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message title is "death"," Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The communication warned the relevant Members that the immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The group disciplinary said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "careful" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year HP is divided into two listed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer business more quickly from growing business equipment and services.
Expected work operations will bring around $2.7 billion costs from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP release.
"The restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the president of HP and the CEO, which will lead the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help companies move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it's focusing on producing non-comparative integrated technology solutions for companies, says the company's communication.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated from the Stanford University University founded in the 1930s in order to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in the Palo Alto, called "Piilaakso's birthplace".
HP has undergone a huge reorganization to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology groups in the United States, and its division is the most recent sector based on the belief that firms that are strictly limited are better performing.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates need to support the wounded Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's match.
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire that it is only September and assumed that his rehabilitation is going according to the plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, at least four of the next English games will be missed, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European championships next summer.
The biggest pity on this last problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single nasty one, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as well as Wenger admitted, when a player attempts to return to the middle of the road there is always a risk of additional injuries.
The formation also has an uncomfortable model.
The studies of the Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debytated six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played 157 liiga games at Arsenal in only 65 games.
In view of Arsenal's broader population since 2007-08, for the six years, it has been one of the Valioliiga teams that have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of a witch circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of their last season in the injuries statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you get back from the injury can be a risky period when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am sure that will happen, and that he will make a career that he deserves.
Wenger is ready to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Masters' League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arte are probably on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain the balance and give a break to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Even though Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F block, the stadium of Maximir in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign in the last season.
On Tuesday night, Stadion quake up a earthquake, which was 3,2 Richter's scale.
It was in the tenth Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned to surrender the Champions' League of the last season against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cupi victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about the friendship between men
It is spectacular how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates for young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 upper secondary school and high school students who showed depression symptoms. According to the study, the person’s ability to recover doubled if enough high percentage of his friends were "healthful".
Similarly, the probability of developing potential mental health problems for those who were not depressed would be half-life if they were happy to have healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes over content and the immediateity of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though isolation really controls.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not get greater happiness.
The fineness of the Frendie was just that it turned this focus on his head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey's and Chandler's many hugs, the moments in the nice chairs, I watch football, Ross miss Rachel... these humor came out of the fact that, yes, men can match all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans organization explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have truly understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling."
Often, men who contact us feel that they can't talk to friends.
The old thought of getting over is strong, as is the feeling that if you get out of trouble, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that come to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people with despair at moments, long-term support comes from a nearby, personal family and friends network.
And so if you're going to participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the pictures will be re-planned for the party, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or, what better if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendies will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria's doing the paint and helps PSG hit Malmö's side.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a goal in his Masters' League's Debyyth, helping the PSG to pass the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Under the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started the Champions' League with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions' League in his debyy with a goal of less than four minutes, showing the French League Masters the way, but the team lost a number of opportunities before they finally added their way to Cavan when they hit the goal at 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same A-section with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish League Champion, for the game was not just a post, but also a cure for their quarterfinal games in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the scores, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy in the Champions' League to win at home or visitors, so 2-0 wins create problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, even though there are things we have to do this season," Blanc said.
This is gonna be good for you.
We wanted to win and win, even though I regret that we failed to make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team from one of the three changes that took place after the team stayed in the 2-2 game Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine squadron was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran into Marco Verratt's bait behind Malmö's defence line and then struck a beautiful finalization by Johan Wiland to the back corner of the network.
But if someone was expecting the PSG to be easy and big, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent, winning at Celtic's resolution when it reached this level, with nine international players in the opening room and five-man defence and two players in the deep middle.
But the team didn't offer much more than a 34-minute shot by Nikola Djurdjic, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp's goal line.
On the other hand, the PSG was sometimes lost because of the feedings lost and the bad finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the touch of Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing his pre-work to his colleagues, and just from the feed of Ibrahimovic, Di Maria sent on the way to a twilight that struck the Wiland goal point around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally obtained after an hour of the game, thanks to the sixth goal of the season, the uruguay Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had pushed forward from the left of Maxwell's cross-eating.
It ended with Malmö's wishes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's direct kick kept the end numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz from the exchange was rejected right at the end of the game.
Later, Coach Age Hareide of Malmö admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Masters' League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
It was a great game from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for the sale of shares.
On Wednesday, the mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the price collapse of basic goods, collected $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its broad debt management plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, reported in the notice that it had sold new shares for about GBP 1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company that lost 57% of its market value this year struggles with the prices of the collapsed basic goods when the Chinese economy slows demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning stores.
The shares increased by 2.77 per cent in the FTSE 100 index 131.60, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed, as part of the 2,5 billion dollars stock trade last week, its broader plan to cut up its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital of 125 p.m., which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99% of the group.
The concerns of long-term Chinese growth have reduced prices of iron malt by about half and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The President of China Xi Jinping will make a public visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House opinion was confirmed on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing, which was said in November.
The President of the United States and the President's spouse, Michelle Obama, will organise dinner for X and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of President X gives the opportunity to broaden cooperation between the United States and China in a number of common interests in global, regional and bilateral matters, and at the same time gives President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively matters with disagreements", it was added in the draft resolution.
At a visit, first published in February, Xin is expected to also depart in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous US technology leaders before he continues towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern regarding alleged network vacancies in China and the increased absoluteness of the country in the disputed South China Sea waters.
Matt Damon is declining the difference in filming.
Matt Damon joined the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown in their discussions about the difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
At the HBO Sunday evening, an actor experienced at the Project Greenlight, interrupted Brown's action while highlighting the need for different perspectives as regards the dark main person of the selected manuscript.
"When we're talking differentials, it's taken into account when choosing actors in the movie, not in the show," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unbelievablely to the injured, the comments "Ooh! Wow. Okay", while the comments from the Martian actress were hanging up.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists in the series.
"I want people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore hit by his white pimp.
The producer of the Dear White People demanded the rights of directing the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded rudely that their guidance "may end up giving us something we don't want".
When the debate was sent, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger on the film, writing: "Matt Damon speaking to the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference between him is NIIN OUT that it hurts."
After its publication, the twist collected more than 5000 retweets and 4000 loves.
Damon's comments are at a time when a precise racial presentation in the media is in the interests of social debate.
After the White Police killed a teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter was spread across the country and called on the legislators and authorities to stop the discriminatory practices of coloured people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the sales in the presentation of the Year's album candidates to receive the Grammy Prize.
"Albumes are still meaningful," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to respond to the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be considered a hostile group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love team," said the leaders.
Recently, Damon was involved in it among the entertainers, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's unclear whether he accepted the invitation or met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Warrior Master Crowned
The professional climber and the collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday who won the American Ninja Warrior contest and received a $1 million prize.
The competition programme that ended its seventh period has never been a competitor, who would have survived all the obstacles of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and a cameraman, Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission was to climb around 23 metres of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, which led him to become the first athlete of all time, who solved the exhausting 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the hardly achieved victory and was still in shock for winning a million dollars prize.
"That's why it's great to think that when I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
The production director Kent Weed followed to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter a finalist and why Britten won't get more bonus money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who's managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
Although money is a great prize and changes life, he will, however, gain great satisfaction.
I don't think he's angry about it.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers hike Minnesota by Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season hasn't been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last one in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get a game-party from Houston Astros in the competition from another American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night returning to the six-wheel H word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All the profits are fun, no matter how they are obtained," said Brad Ausmus, Tigers team leader.
The Tigers feedr Alfredo Simon continued his early assault support when Detroit ran three times in the first two pairs, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in shifts and released three runs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the alternate to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tigers substitutions Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit run after the mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three hits after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He twisted the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in impact exercises), looked considerably better at hit exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the second half of the seventh shift couple, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentren Byron Buxton started a shift by hitting twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks came home with one nest, and Simon got burned straight to the second nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked with Mauer, the only player who was against the entrant, the former victor Miguel Says, who pulled a two-job run to the left of Drew VerHagen, right-handed.
When two runners were on the field and a straightforward runner on the second nest, VerHagen got a third base on Trevor Plouffe to hit a double-winded painting.
It was a record of the main series: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a secure run at the beginning of the ninth, Mauer took two hits against the Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in three baits in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust at the beginning.
Tigers received three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed veteran player, who got out of the list of injured people before the game after being out of the game for more than a month due to naked infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but when I went to the game, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I had done a few nice feedings on my third shift."
After Hughes captured the first nest of the launcher, he let another nest player, Ian Kinsler, move between one.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the hit shift, which took himself on the middle field to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good runways.
Nick Castellanos, the player in the Third Stage, continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned while he tried to move to the third base.
Tigers continued on the second round and got one fire, two nests running from James McCann and two fires, one nest in the event of a run in Anthony Goselta, followed by 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said the Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in feed readings and fed a runless third shift couple, and then became his replacement right-hand extensioner A.J. Achter.
Hughes got three runs from six hits and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed feeder of Tigers, was thrown away in the shoulder's stretch.
He's investigating Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez into the shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to the shoulder ending, but he had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder, Daniel Norris, will be on the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 four initiatives after the left-handed feeder David Price was switched to him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of the bruise of the real abdominal muscle.
The series of three games between Tigers and Twins ends in the Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is placed against the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy more widely for the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth, and President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, which is the task of guiding the reform.
"The China should undertake to attract foreign funding and expertise and to develop transparency policy," she said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as further reforms are driven by new movements and vitalities, as well as creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting access to the market, the degradation of border control principles, the call for private capital by state-owned companies, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, namely those sectors and companies that must not be invested in.
The system is gradually tested and improved through experimental programmes.
The change is significant, as it will give a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, to ensure a legally based business environment and to make the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also confuses its governance in the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that companies decide themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also said that China will allow border regions to be able to examine new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are opening up for private donors to open government-driven sectors.
"Government does not change its direction on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better services", said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional training rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in the opinion published after the meeting.
