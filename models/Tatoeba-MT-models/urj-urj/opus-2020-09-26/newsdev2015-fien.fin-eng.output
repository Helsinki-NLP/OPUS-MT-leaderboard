Changes in business support practices - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU corporate support, the management of national corporate support will be concentrated on four living centres from mid-September.
South Savo ely centre in Mikkel is responsible for operations in Eastern Finland.
According to the new Company Support Act, which entered into force on July, the EU Structural Fund support must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new operation.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of over five thousand residents are also considered to be of great authority.
Instead, EU support for investments that improve the economic conditions of municipalities can continue to be granted.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national support management unit will have a strength of approximately 30 people.
For now, at least, they all continue to work in their current establishments.
For example, the job of Kalevi Pölöse, the head of the Southern Savo electoral unit, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now trying to do in Ukraine
Russia is consistent, even though it does not always seem that way.
The Director of the Strategy Institute for the Defence High School, Colonel, Dominant Torsti Siren was not surprised by Monday morning's contradictory Ukraine news.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia did not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its parachute forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near the Luhanski airport, and that the tank department has received confirmation (read more here).
Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Russia is denying that it is involved and that it must immediately be able to obtain the outcome of the negotiations so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: we have to start negotiating and, in particular, get Russia to take its own to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources passenger services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair starts buying salong services as subcontractors from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement applies at the first stage to the Finnair routes of Hong Kong and Singapore, but it is intended to be extended later.
A total of about a 100-year reduction of two routes in Finland, which takes place at the first stage in holidays, was reported by the company when reporting.
In addition, some 80 Asian rental workers’ jobs will cease at the time the routes are outweighed.
Finnair already stated in June that it intends to outsource cabin services of about 20 routes over the next two years.
They ended up in the outer seats when no agreement was reached with the staff.
Outdoor seats are intended to start in the next year's January-March attack.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve back pain, i.e. stroke pain, in those who work hard.
The study of the Department of Health was followed by firemen for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the stroke pain is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of firemen, which are tested regularly, does not seem to protect from pain, reports the research director, the docent Sirpa Lusa Department of Health.
The work of firemen is an irregular shift, where shifts can delay up to 24 hours.
According to the Agency for Health at work, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Destroy easily in other dwellings
Water wrestles Vesivahinko does not always cause bleeding tubes or cranes, reminds the council's expert.
We have received contacts when the breach of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company that the aquariums can be banned, reports Marina Furuhjelm, the Counsellor of Governance.
Furuhjelm reminds us that only pipes and sewers are not common causes of water damage, but today more and more new machines such as ice burners have caused water spills in housing.
Many do not know that machines such as a washing machine or washing machine should not be left uncontrolled.
The water surface shall also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe may lead to water leakage.
The resident may be considered to have committed negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the person is liable for damage.
Of course, in these cases home insurance can compensate for damage, depending on the conditions and cases of insurance.
If it can be shown that a resident has caused careless damage, the resident shall be liable for compensation.
If the resident has fallen into a shower on the floor well, the negligence can often be proven because in these cases the water is usually flooded elsewhere and the caregiver comes into the apartment where the lost resident is found.
The furuhuhjelm tells us that, due to the generalisation of the extinction on the floor well, two floor wells are currently installed in many students' dwellings.
Water sinks have also been caused by water beds, although no longer so much as they were popular in the past.
Even the dog’s water bubbles and the fall of home wine can cause real water damage.
I also know a case in which there were many cats in the apartment that had pissed on the floor so that there were extensive damages, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of remedial liability is always the same if the company’s statute does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the building company's structure and damage to other apartments.
Water wrestles easily cause damage to other apartments because the structure of concrete is really easy to suck water.
According to Furuhjelm, the batteries of apartments are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaking into conspicuous structures.
Water scars can now cause generalised air heat pumps that produce condensive water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or a rainwater network, not just a dish.
The shareholder also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the lawyer advises.
Furuhjelm advises that even though the rules of the house company do not require, for example, a fixed removal hose of the washing machine, the insurance may have a condition for which compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance conditions.
However, I consider the washing machines unbundled, for example, the water drain pipes led into the tub as a major risk of many damages.
I recommend that the drain waters are always firmly led to the sewer pipeline.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Control of washing machine, case washing machine, etc., on-board.
Clothing of water shafts (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible twice in half a year.
The recommendation is to firmly connect the drain waters to the sewer.
Check the cranes and their possible bleeds
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experience in the commentary?
FC Honka disappeared again and sparkled into a serial jumbo
In the Tapiola Sports Park, on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams encountered a football League gymnast.
The last winner in June was hosted by FC Honka in a seven-game winning tube of Vaasa Ball Society.
VPS just received Honka's previous victory in July.
Sunday's meeting with the espoolan team came to a good chamber, because VPS returned from a long time to a profit rate of 2-1.
Prior to the game, the main coach of the Vacasians, Olli Huttunen, complained about the inefficiency of his team, but the confusing Honka defence made it easier for VPS to make the goal-making problems.
It's very nervous to do it.
We didn't get longer attacks at all, we couldn't have a ball," Huttunen assessed the performance of our own.
In the first half, Honga's topparicac Milos Milovic, Kosta Manev was really insecure.
Both white paints were born as a result of the toppare lame play.
The opening room was only seen after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey controlled the shooting of Sebastian Strandvall by Walter Viitalan, the shattered Honka painter.
It's the first half-time to be harassed.
By the way of the field, the team did the opposite of the match before the game," shefki Kuqi Manasi, Honga's chief coach.
After the initial shock, the espoolians got their game together and rolled the ball in the head of the attack.
In particular, the middle field player Carlos Portela and Roni Porokara were enthusiastically searching for sites, but the final solutions were almost repetitive.
The nearest goal was the Honga Central Fielder Jussi Vasara, whose 20 metres fired a little past the VPS painting.
VPS attacked effectively using their vicious assaults and Honga's confusing topparipa.
Within half an hour, the vassals made a 2-0 position when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached the two of them.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good slot in the opening season and created repeated situations on the left side.
And Stewart's speed seemed to be too much for espoolan protection all along the game.
"I'd say in half time that if we lose, then we'll lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
Honka, the intruder, went for the second episode with a tremendous decoration paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the punishment area.
After the goal of Vilaboa, Honga had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which gave VPS the opportunity to attack dangerously.
Both Stewart and Morrissey had a very smart time with Viitalan, but the Honka painter's shackles held home team in the game.
At the end, Honka got a little tired, and he didn't get any more paintings early.
With the loss, Honka enlightened for the last time, when there were seven more matches left.
Journal: Putin threatened to conquer Kiev in two weeks
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was very loud at the phone debate with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his anger in the European Union's plans to blackmail sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian TV channel an interview about the crisis in Ukraine on Sunday evening.
Putin told me in the interview that he held the conflict fully internally in Ukraine and urged the government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he very much warned Kiev about the shooting of civilian destinations in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't watch next door" if people are shot to death from close distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The actress's work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Kokari acting and theatre cultivated to admit how the actress's profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actress Esko Roine next Friday will be 70 years, but I think it's true for him to say that the age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but still he's working for a lot of men.
Sometimes they were joking that there aren't many plays in this country without Esko Roine.
At present Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in bothering business, the Theatre of the Tampere Workers and the Kvartet of the Tampere Komediateatre.
Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Räppääja film.
DESCRIPTION: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's actor career didn't begin promisingly.
I wasn't good at school for a cargo-boy picture.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was the reason I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't fall off.
The career choice was clear. There were no options.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and volunteered to go to the army just to get to the theater school as soon as possible.
Roine has made about 200 theater offices and 300 TV shows a little depending on how it is calculated.
If things are counted as angels, that every part of the TV series is its own show, there are more than 600 TV stuff.
I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
In spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Eskon's big sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full blow and make the Tampere Workers' Theatre's Theater's yet to be amazed as anarchist monuments.
The little brother's gonna be working on the pot for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to take a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
There are reservations in the calendar for the autumn 2016.
For years, they've left a man behind, too.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip whistles and the arthritis is bothering, but when you don't let it too much to disturb you, Esko Roine says.
To the TV audience, Roine was known in mm.
A pirate radio, and a glimpse where he shared hundreds of dollars with Antti Einio.
It was Antti Einiö who shared crops.
I was trying to make sure they were hundreds and not hundreds.
In the reinikainen series, Roine was a frustratingly important Inspector Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of Tampere policemen, at the institution when he was working with the same state of affairs.
One policeman stopped the car on the street, pulled the window open and yelled to me, "The Iron Rock is great!"
Working party successful
Theatreworks have been reminded of Roine, for example.
The Producer and Master Class of the City of Helsinki, the death of the Theatre of the Tampere Workers and the long-day journey of the Tampere Theatre to the night.
It's all about the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's the team that's done it.
There's been rimanals, too.
Pekka Puupea's role in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the result is neither myself nor the viewers.
As a row actress, you can't choose your own job.
It's just what's been done nicely.
In addition to the theater, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It was nothing when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then also a diner.
If I remember correctly, in a year, it turned out that they can't be reconciled.
Typical was that when the show was at the end or in the interim, and I had time to wonder if I'd put on the sauna, the restaurant made a call that there were your friends who would like to see you after the show.
Memories for Birth
On his day of birth, the memoirs from Esko Roine appear, as ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of staple they have created from the image of the face-twisting.
I was called Zoom when I was playing, they called me a facewriter.
They're not the names I've known.
The book has been made for years.
In time, Roine told me that no news bombs are allowed because he hasn't done anything that cruel, or if he is, he won't tell me.
I made a little break in the book.
I'm saying that if someone is waiting for scandalous discoveries or good gossips, you should stop reading here.
There's a lot of professional issues, so as an actress as the theater's director.
The publisher says that there are also tourists from the outdoor theater school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but a kid came to do all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as crazy as Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got from there than self-confidence, that when school's gone, I know that it's not caught if you don't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I had been to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I was friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen, and I was able to work with them.
There were legends from my first husband, Karlo Haltus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
The middle boy of the fire, Martha, was with me at the same course.
At the theater school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttusen.
As a matter of pain, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long fight, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that the daughter went to my mom and son.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I believe that the children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It's not rare in the theater circles that the silver will be divided.
In our case, some part was that I worked quite a lot at the time.
I was in the theater about almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and a family life suffered.
Maybe on the day of the celebration.
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers' Theatre on 7 September.
The party will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
A devil of his mind is lying there too.
I was at work in the 50s and at work in the 60s.
When such an easy-to-moving play occurred, I thought that it would now be held for the seventies, so we'll get them out with a single stunt.
Roine says there's no celebration on her real birthday.
I remember it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have had some work to do for that day.
Or it's a strange night I'm going to take off tonight, Roine says.
Companies in the aviation sector concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller aircraft manufacturers in the UK are concerned that the production capacity problems in the supply chain may deplete the ambitious plans of major aeroplanes manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aeroplanes.
In the United Kingdom, thousands of companies in the production chain of aeroplanes enjoy an unexpected amount of aeroplane and engine development plans that are currently being implemented at the same time.
Aviation and defence
While some enjoy the order call, warnings have been given to the capacity problems and price pressures that are at the disposal of the production chain.
"It is quite true that there is a price pressure, especially now that production is challenging," says Craig Gallagher, director of MB Aerospace, the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing a supplier of North West England’s aerospace production, requires additional capacity.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure about that.
First and foremost, we need more investment in new production facilities and machines that are needed to enable these production levels to be implemented," says Gallagher.
Some companies believe that the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft buildings are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchilli, the CEO of JJ Chrurchilli, who produces gas turbines, the company has a "failing time" behind it, when several new construction plans started to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
We moved in the eye to a very low production space where the production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and in addition we had to try to push forward.
However, it is inevitable to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing GBP 800 000 in new machines and hiring 26 new workers.
Several actors in the sector believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed more if the UK wishes to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
The President of Ford Aerospace and engineer of Fine Mechanics from Tyneside, Geoff Ford, says that the order sum should increase producers' confidence and desire to expand and increase production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition against other countries," says Ford.
Some major operators are trying to solve the problem by obtaining capacity.
Senior purchased 75 million pounds of UPECA for the production of parts of aeroplanes operating in Malaysia, which is a FTSE 250 index.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy new activities for creative Start-up companies, but in reality most of the production is slowing down planning limitation and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted from large aircraft manufacturers and from aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of production chain operators are exaggerated.
Mr Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN Aeroplane production unit, who is also the representative of the British Aeroplane trade, believes that the production chain has been more handled than in the previous periods.
There are pressures in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than this," says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from mistakes and are now more cautious to avoid increasing the number of buildings too quickly.
When Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company made losses and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's Aeroplane production unit, says that the company has not yet faced any problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts required for the production of an airplane engine.
"You will certainly be ugly, but we believe that we have worked more thoroughly on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and by keeping the suppliers in contact with them when they are preparing to increase activity," Wood says.
According to Boeing's CEO, James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted transparently to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, Managing Director of Airbus’s Service for the production of passenger sprayers, says that the company will do everything it can to reduce the risks related to its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists is failing, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and support the suppliers and find alternatives, but there are big problems," says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for sins: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
So this is my work and Airbus's work."
Hong Kong's demonstration groups will start the 'Civic Dispute Period' when Beijing is not invoked by open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democracies activists spread to the streets of Hong Kong after they rejected the requirements of their open elections.
The groups in Hong Kong in favour of democracy stress that demonstrations can squeeze and swear to ensure that the city begins with the "an era of indebtedness" against the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of demonstrators threatened by rainfalls coming against Hong Kong's glowing horizon when they travelled in the spirit of the Occupy Central Group to organise a demonstration before the Council of Law implementation on Sunday night, where demonstrators invited people to take part in a large seating demonstration in order to deteriorate the city's financial map.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it prohibits the right of voters to propose candidates publicly in the Mayors' elections in 2017, defensing these months of mental expressions that increase the horror age of the city.
The demonstrators will take part in the beginning of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website administrator, who participated in a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kongians.
The Chinese National Congress adopted plans for changes in elections which allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-length appointment committee, and the opposition politicians feel that this will effectively prevent the access of the different political parties to the election tickets.
The demonstrators are involved in the demonstration carried out in the context of the Occupy Central Love and Peace Protest in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government building.
According to police estimates, more than 2 600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of cops followed when some 100 demonstrators led by the Scholarism study group gathered late Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a Communist Party member, was scheduled to stay after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, the exact date when the blocking of the roads is carried out, but called on the participants to monitor closely the development of the situation "in the next few weeks" while adding that the city is officially moving to "the era of civil disobedience".
Benny or answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in the demonstration of the Sunday, in front of the advertising board representing two characters of disobedience in China.
That man will take over the center with you!
The 17-year-old conveniences representing Scholarism Joshua Wong said earlier that the preparations for the protests of high school students are ongoing and are designed to be maintained at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to express their opinions by refusing to do so.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," says Wong.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary General of the Committee of the People's Congress, Li Fei told journalists that defending the 'international requirements' of the general voting right is 'time-lost' and coming from some of the Hong Kong politicians who are trying to 'confusing society and leading it misleading'.
"Some practical proposals such as the nomination of public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, calling for a method of election to be set up so that it is compatible with the real situation of each society and with the legislative framework.
Only if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, supports the legislative initiative, which means that the 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong may have been dragged into a long-term political debate if the proposal for a reform is rejected by a veto law.
"It would affect business and the development of the city," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organised by the Occupy Central store in June to oppose China's demands, and according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Even 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the 17th August marching organized against Beijing's victorious and Occupy Central was attracted to some 88,000 participants. The estimates are from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of the police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks on the shore of New York.
In a lightning attack on a bathing beach in New York, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured at the Orchard Beach Beach in Pelham Bay in Bronx on Sunday night when the heavy storms crossed the area.
Injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the heavy thunderstorms wiped over town.
The storm rains, thunderstorms and lightning stopped the Labor Day party and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the island of East River.
Tens of commercial flights to the airports in town were late for bad weather.
The new idea is not supposed to be pleased
This is the latest guide of network users to employees and supervisors, and is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea to identify comments such as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
Unless this is the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident — so boring and everyday — or the benefits it brings with it are so small that it is not worth seeking them.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as director of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message can be received widely.
Advertising Consultant Bob Hoffman believes that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news about the network does not mean that the Internet is a good one between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson points out that one word is enough to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they will resolve the problem as a co-operation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room; these participants worked longer and would solve more problems than those who were not informed of their cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeated pattern or relationship between two units, the performance expert Dave Paradi advises you to forget Microsoft's SmartArt and instead to use the Diagrammer.com program, which can select 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart hospital cavity surgery prohibited due to safety risk
The specialist is temporarily dismissed, and the UK National Health System NHS stopped directing patients to the cavity surgery to that private hospital after the hospital problems came up.
Two people came to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has been reported to have been involved in the 19 patients who were treated on July 26, and has invited them to "special clinical research".
The Mount Stuart hospital apologised and said that the matter had begun to be investigated since the doctor was fired.
The case came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated in Mount Stuart applied for their emergency eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of NHS 19 patients who were all investigated on the same day had to have had any repair surgery.
Torbay’s hospital and South Devon and Torbay’s cure have not been controlled by patients since problems with Mount Stuart have occurred.
The temporary director David Sinclair of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation leading to Torbay Hospital said: "We have identified the problem at the beginning and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its permits are in order.
According to Mr Gill Gant, the head of the South Devon and Torbay Medical Hospital Safety, "patient safety is always the absolute first priority, so it is important that these cage surgery are not carried out for as long as we can be fully sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, the manager of the Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "forgively for all patients who suffered complications".
The company was reported to be "when we found out about a possible problem, we and the Torbay hospital later called all the patients involved".
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 cavity surgery in various parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of his surgery have been excellent and the complication rate has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily dismissed until the matter has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
The Bad Anonymous Communication site published first famous naked images
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published stolen images?
"4chan" was established in 2003. It has been a discussion-induced communication site, which is being cited as much as is praised.
The site is divided into several sections, i.e. notification tables, which enable anonymous users to discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hackering.
Unlike other online fora, users do not create a single, continuously used profile and their publications are not retained.
With the most popular announcement tables, the comments may disappear in less than one minute, while the new publications outweigh them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchy and surprising creative atmosphere in "4chan".
The members of anonymous community have created some of the most well-known features of the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification table of the site is /b/, which is intended for the discussions and to which NSFW is regularly displayed (Not Safe For Work).
This may include summer porn, but also brutal and shocking images. Anonymous hacker published famous stolen images specifically on this announcement table on the weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer drugs in research and development
CytRx aims at improving cancer – or at least slowing it down.
A biomedical company in L.A., which became the subject of the stock-marketing event, specialised in the research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is an aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical studies with aldocsorubicin soft tissue arcoma, capos sarcoma associated with AIDS and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that passes directly into the tumour and not into any other body, says the CEO of CytRx Steven Kriegsman about the anticancer antidote to aldocsorubicin.
My aldocrubicin contains so-called interconnection technology that works like a Troyan horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which is also accumulated in tumours, where the medicine passes directly into cancer cells.
I joined the drug only in a acidized environment, that is, cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to be given more and more cancer medicine at doses.
"It's like a missile that passes directly into the tumor and not into any other body," says CEO Steven Kriegsman of the CytRx company.
Like many other biotechnology companies that are focusing on developing medicines, CytRx does not make profits.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected $86 million for maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking globally for 400 patients in a critical phase 3 clinical trial for alternative treatment of soft tissue rkoma.
Soft tissue snake is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissues.
Alternative treatment is used in the treatment of cancer when the original treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical study is successful, CytRx is planning to apply for permission from the administration of food and medicines in the United States already in 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicine could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx in the previous clinical study in December showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue squamous.
"A long time the question was, "We have not seen clinical information about how much it differs from the medicine itself," says the analyst of H.C. Wainwright & Co.'s investment company Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed a number of opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and timetables of the current clinical study because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Most things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of drugs to the mining industry.
“The first is to invest a lot of money to find that one golden vessel, and the placement will continue until that golden vessel is found,” he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for as long as the drug can be traded.
Several shareholders have requested CytRx to be brought into court because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
The complaints accuse the company that it hired the investment relationship company DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments on the CytRx company and the other biotechnology company for Articles such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fooli and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, the Seeking Alpha announced that it deleted the articles, "who were inconsistent with practice".
Several articles on companies were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an extra lawyer to respond to the actions.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
He believes that the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to seek employment in the centres of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry in many respects," he says.
Views of the analytical journal
The price of the shares of the CytRx company rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising of shares came to the public.
According to the analysis report, actions and negative publicity have decreased the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to pass this issue as long as the concept is in force."
In the name of the law, the cameraman in the police series was killed in the middle of the shootings.
The photographer based on real events, in the name of the Law in Finland, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of the shooting intersection.
The cameraman pictured a shooting between a suspect of a gun robbery in a private police patrol and a fast food restaurant when he hit the bullets.
He quickly died of the injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that a suspect of armed robbery was killed in an intersection in addition to a cameraman.
The first series of true TV programmes in the name of the Law have been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The issue of an outside factor is raised in the crucial role of the court court proceedings that began the death of Ulvila today.
Anneli Aueria is charged with the murder of his husband Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
The Vaasa court will now deal with the case for the second time, since the Supreme Court has returned it to the court with the new evidence.
The purpose of the court is that the judgment will be given on the side of this year.
The Vaasa court liberated Auer in 2011.
The court then considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening statement, the Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala spoke of the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and of the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
We believe that the crucial question is whether an outside factor has come into the house that has killed Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in the way and in time.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," said Kulmala.
According to the prosecutor, Auer had announced that he would leave home and get a divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti held onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One took the kitchen knife," the corner described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, there are several evidence that there was no external character.
For example, an emergency phone recording does not contain any voices on an external factor.
In the interrogation, Auer's oldest child, the daughter, told me that he saw the guy leaving the fireplace door.
The release judgment of the Vaasa court in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the finding of a daughter cannot be true.
"The girl didn't see an outside factor in the parents' bedroom, even though she went there twice to watch," said Kulmala.
The new witness of the prosecutor is just connected to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahde's sister has been telling me about the events since the night of the murder at the hospital.
According to her daughter in the hospital, she only saw Lahde’s body when she was in the garage at the scene of death.
Mr Auer's defence intends to present to the court investigation lines which, according to the defence, have not been sufficiently determined by the police.
When the Vaasa court released Auer for three years ago, the court had to find the dna of a foreign man as one of the outsiders.
The sample later proved to be the DNA of a researcher working at the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
That's when 700 people took a DNA sample as a mass sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigative lines were excluded," said Mr Juha Manner, defense attorney.
One of the new witnesses of the defense reports about a possible external factor.
The Ulvil woman told the police about a pork man who, according to the woman, confessed to the act.
The police interrogated a man in the summer.
The prosecutor made a decision that a pork man had nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecutor filed an inquiry because the prosecutor suspected a woman lied to her report.
One of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who worked at the night of death at the Central Hospital of Satakunta.
The precinct was sentenced to Auer's life sentence for murder last December.
According to the Court of Justice, the possibility of an outsider was fought against, inter alia, the reports of the children of Auer, the noises of the external agent missing from the emergency centre deposit, and the time required by the events.
The judgment came by 2-1 votes.
A minority judge wrote that the evidence contradictory in the criminal case must be interpreted as the benefit of the defendant.
That is why the report of the daughter must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions of the report, it had detected the outside person leaving the back room.
The two oldest children of Auer have been invited to hear the court court.
The daughter was first heard personally last year in the premier court of the Satakunta.
In court, he no longer remembered what happened at the night of the murder.
The second oldest child of Auer named the killer of his mother in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me that he heard the night of the murder happened behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
The son has no obligation as a lawyer to speak anything in court.
The court will continue today with Anneli Auer's hearing.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years on sexual and violence crimes against children.
Should Putin's participation at the G20 meeting be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the first of many.
Putin is scheduled to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia will be strongly discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock Activist Group, Pussy Riot, requested Australia to ban Putin's participation in the summit this weekend, with over 4,000 representatives from the most powerful countries in the world.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting," said Maria Alyokhina to the public in Sydney's fully packed opera house in the event of the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that he is on the edge of the "full war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new Russia". Is it therefore necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, "trust the decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, the Head of the Lowy Institute of Research, the Australians cannot decide who will take part in the meeting, even though the meeting will be held in the country.
"Austria can decide who it will let down, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just as New York hosts UN meetings or Washington hosts International Monetary Fund meetings, "the task of the host is not to deny someone called to come", Callaghan says.
On the previous week, Tony Abbott said that he was "decreasing the decision" after the devastating actions of Russia in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is on his way to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on it alone.
"However, there is an important issue that I will consider a lot, and I believe that other countries will also do so in the next few weeks," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest-developed economies, with around two-thirds of the world's people living, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include: Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few countries not belonging to the G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given a questionable task to balance the various interests under great public pressure.
He believes that the best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to talk publicly about his recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we will use this opportunity to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will require President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to give an explanation of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects them to take these things into consideration.
The Russian rebels are preparing weapons for the attack on Ukraine's military bases at the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Puti is taking part in the meeting, and Callaghan says that this is not necessarily known until a few days before.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly finds that "I must change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Mr Bill Shorten, the opponent, takes the view that Putin came to Australia "very reservations", but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events followed by the Malaysian Airlines accident, as well as in the absence of a proper cooperation capacity in connection with the pity, responsibilities and accidents, and now, as thousands of Russian soldiers wandering on the Ukraine border, I think that most Australians are very booked to welcome Putin.
The German business world criticises Berlin
Some of the German top corporate leaders warn that Germany has become "trustful" and "sufficiency" because government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the country.
Confederal Chancellor Angela Merkel's government criticism happens at the same time as the European largest economy shows signs of slowdown, which will give rise to the concern of whether it is able to spin economic growth on the ground in the polar euro area.
The criticism of corporate leaders is the result of the intense opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wages and the calculation of the pension age of certain long-servers for 63 years.
"I think that the greatest threat to Germany right now is overconfidence, which inevitably leads to the feeling of self-consistency", says Kurt Bock, the world's largest chemical manufacturer, the world's CEO of BASF.
EU economy
He believes: "In general, we have the feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there's a big danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and we are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather focusing on sharing wealth and meeting certain expectations.
According to Markus Kerber, the CEO of the German Industry Organisation (BDI), "The German situation is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy needs to change. ...[Germany] the reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even once again, consumption is slowed down again.
However, the second quarter declined GDP has highlighted the vulnerability of the export profit in Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2 per cent over the previous three months of June compared to the previous year.
The weakened performance of Germany is threatening to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "go back from public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing on the increases in future consumption in infrastructure and not on pensions.
Kerber believes that the Merkel Government will destroy the fruits produced by its socialist predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in the early 2000s, by a strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, the Executive Director of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, "Germany still has a good situation compared to other countries.
It's thanks to companies, not government policies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The French example of the neighbouring country has shown that the use of money to social aid and the restriction of the freedom to conduct a company is the wrong way of action.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more clearly, saying that the recent decisions of the government are a disaster.
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has done so much to please the voters.
This is my main issue right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition were not able to solve the fundamental weaknesses of policy which have led to the cost of reducing industry's competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher handshake with music festivals, prevented access to the fan by security guards
Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach Cantri Music Festivals in India, California, where he is reported to have a tight fight with a security guard.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have a fight with the security guard at the country music festivals.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach Cantri Music Festivals in California, and then the situation robbed, says the TMZ site.
Kutcher was in VIP when a young woman approached her to say hello and hand her.
When the Star of the Male Series went to say hello to the fan, a super-inspired securityman went in and caused a squirrel.
The actress and the security officer took a handbag, and Kutcher's friends had to step in to hold Kutcher, says TMZ.
After his ex-wife from Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is like Kutcher, the stars of the former '70s show.
Soon after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the standard playlist card after he published a video in which he calls the series "basic" and invites the fans not to look at it.
Ashton Kutcher participates in the Stagecoach Music Festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the series "Scum" and tells people not to look at it.
The Baltic bacteria killed a holidaykeeper.
Six people have been sick of the bacteria from Caribbean to the popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick people is in a coma.
The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria is met in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is found mostly in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spreads most effectively in more than 20 degrees of fracture waters.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct," told Dr. Heiko Will, the head of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS).
The bacteria is also found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the patient had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
The second pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his foot should be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound in his leg.
The sick one went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his foot has become blue.
In the foot, the doctors found a blood poisoning caused by the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea, if he had known the danger," said the sick wife Sonja Bruehl to the Ostsee Zeitung magazine.
A serious disease and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and his family could have been avoided if the information had been better available. For example, the holiday site could have prepared a notification.
LAGuS told the Dpa News Office that doctors have been called upon to have the following infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official information was received.
The cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
The results of the [ Monday] test showed that V. V. vulnificus has decreased significantly," Dr. Will says.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease and impaired immune response such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
The risk of male disease is greater than that of women because the oestrogen has been identified to protect against pathogens.
If it gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
After the bacterial has been wounded, the likelihood of death is about 25 per cent.
The V. V. vulnificus bacteria can also be affected by eating the marine animals contaminated by it, although Dr. Will says that in these cases it is not this infectious.
The pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern sphere.
In Germany, V. V. vulnificus caused poisoning the previous time in 2010, when two people died.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed because of suspected cancer.
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen has a workout and exercise hard, but he has also had to fear for his health.
It's incredible that the radiating Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He himself is surprised how suddenly those years of age can be so many.
I haven't really realized I was this old.
For 80 years, it sounds like a lot of fun, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, he was held a birthday party by the People's Music and Retirement Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were at Kekkola's stage in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so embarrassed about the party, the birthday hero tells me about the opportunity where the three hundred stages were completely filled with congratulations.
A few days later, Muhos was convened to greet Arm Kuusel, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following when he was a young man.
And now we're both of this age!
Vieno Kekkonen is laughing.
During his long career, there are only few parts of Vieno Kekkose that have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never before been publicly told: 2006 he was removed from another chest.
I had an unambiguous discovery on my chest that it was decided to remove it completely.
At the end, then, it wasn't cancer, which I was, of course, happy.
In the same surgery, a new breast was made, so it was a very big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he has lost his own chest in a way in vain, because the knowledge of the unambiguous finding would have been a heavy position and cannot be handled.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that loss to the younger ones is certainly more difficult.

The farmer is made guilty of sea condition
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The vote of experts has been drowned into politically meaningful opinions.
In particular, the Sanoms of Helsinki and Yle in the summer have thrived the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
Fast action has been required to control emissions in the same way.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental researchers and help them to provide the relevant suppliers with an overcomparative diet expert.
The farmer knows that nutrient flushing cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as the crop is harvested.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful monitoring and reporting of the nutrition balance.
The authorities will monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutritions stored in the field have also been washed into water since fertiliser restrictions, but there have been a clear reduction in emissions for years too.
Farmers are willing and ready to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero is impossible.
"If we want to have an approximate amount of agricultural production equivalent to consumption, it must only be accepted," says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of the MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8).
The last summer brought blue feathers to the Gulf of Finland.
Researchers were quite unanimous about the fact that the algae received growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is partly a wrestler of the past decades of farming in the coast, but it alone does not explain stocks.
The cleaning of waste water from the growing cities of the Baltic Sea was on the ground until the end of the 19th century.
The problem was also about large Helsinki waste water, and they were not seen as a problem as regards the contamination of their own beaches.
Coastal pollution was prevented by building a waste water pipe to the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water is improved over the years.
Nutritions that ended in the sea at a time will not leave, even if agriculture would be completely out of Finland.
Yet, every summer's blue debate and the accusations put forward are always about agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer guilty of the Baltic Sea State.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it will become more difficult when it is used to implement political passion.
Greens are driving major changes to agricultural environmental standards under the leadership of their presidency, Minister of the Environment, Ville Niinistö.
As a pondboard, Ninistö's been having a summer rest discussion.
The Societies have very much accused the Producer’s frontiers’ association of the MTK of old age and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some kind of border on political rhetoric.
Most specific water protection projects are based specifically on cooperation between the MTK, farmers and environmental administration.
The assaulting style of the societies serves more fishing for urban green noises than water protection.
I guess that's the point.
With hard speech, the greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the MTK shall be responsible for ensuring the performance of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes to farmers unless there is a substitute for their costs.
The only money Ville Niinistö's made is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The revocation of the mining tax will not go through: Palmer
The last attempt of Abbott's government to throw a mining tax into the garbage basket looks condemned, because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the Government has included a new initiative a rule that could limit employers' increases to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government used a qualified majority in Parliament's subroom on Monday to speed up the revocation process in general confusion and to the clear disruption of the Labour Party.
It sivulined the original revocation initiative, in which the Senate had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with the new legislative proposal described above all in relation to taxes, pension payments, social security and family social assistance.
Initially, it was an initiative aimed at annulment of the "unsuccessful" mining tax and other decisions, such as the low-income pension fee (dollar savings), the earnings premium (dollar 1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children (dollar 4.7 billion).
The President of the Palmer United Party (PUP), Clive Palmer, did not accept the transfer of the government.
"The intention to cancel the mining tax is not accepted in the Senate without the payment of pensions for low-income people, the bonus for income bonus for children of school age", he tweeted.
The government needs support for independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Minister Chris Bowen of the Treasury accused the government of attempting to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of guarantees for pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the power to decide.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further increases, so that the 12% target of the pension contributions of the Labour Party would move up to 2034.
"It is in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will, of course, oppose all the means," says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future amendments.
The man's body was found on Brighton's swimming beach.
Sussex's cops picked up an unidentified man's body before 2:00 p.m., and the police closed the area near the beginning of Volk's Electric Railway.
The police and the D.A. are working to find out where the body was placed on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers will go through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons are in contact with the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, an accidental explosion on the border is a death victim.
According to Piedras Negras Police, the accidental explosion in the customs building on the border of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational leader of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died in the explosion on Sunday got skull damage and that five others got burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place in the nightclubs of customs officials this morning.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe the accumulation of the explosives.
The explosion didn't affect border guards.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month.
Male customer plays in Showboat casino, which is to close his door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in the state of New Jersey, which means that this neon-lighted metropolis, known for cash machine shaft, can no longer be counted on the gambling income.
More than 5,000 employees remain unemployed during the closure of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, reported by the Associated Press News Office.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, are the last disaster in the city after the story of the Atlantic Club has ended only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25 percent of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, writes New York Times.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a secure choice for Atlantic City, the AP News Office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors when New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania casinos are blocking a large part of Atlantic City once in such vast casinos.
Even those who were opposed to threatening threats, Massachusetts is looking at their share of the amount of money by greeting three casinos to the state.
TVO: The new schedule of Areva is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new estimate of the institutional supplier of Areva that the third reactor of Olkiluodo is only available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the leader of the power plant project, this is due, inter alia, to the fact that construction works are already well prepared and the number of work that is ongoing is known.
The TVO will continue to assess the information received by Areva.
In the communication, Silvennoinen notes that the TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today submitted to TVO the updated timetable for Olkiluoto 3 that the third reactor’s construction works would be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva Communication, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the approval of the reactor automation systems, which was obtained in April.
Negotiations with the TVO lasted four years.
Olkiluoto 3 had to initially graduate already in 2009, but the timetable has been postponed once and for all.
The TVO and Areva have argued for years about which one is responsible for the delay.
Disputes on the arbitration court, where Areva has demanded compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from the TVO.
The TVO, in turn, considers Areva's requirements unfounded and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
The international leaders met today in the framework of the 24th international water week in Stockholm, and they called on the energy and water industry to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure that water and energy production is still growing.
The theme of the Water Week 2014 is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for water pumping, storage, transport and cleaning, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it affects the other immediately.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be remembered when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, Managing Director of the International Water Institute of the Water Week organised by Stockholm, said in the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore urgently need closer cooperation between energy and water operators in order to find solutions that can help all world nations to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received this year's water award, described water as a basis for growth, which is needed both as a whole and in other sectors. Briscoe said, "the developing countries face major challenges.
They have to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis].
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the circle.
Over a week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water actors during more than a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
First Professor John Briscoe from South Africa receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King of Sweden Kaarle XVI, from Kusta, in the ceremony to be held in the city house of Stockholm on Thursday, 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research information and provides decision-makers with information so that they can make reasonable decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flying home of dead foreign bodies in Miami: Costs of flying bodies
In October 2012 23 Cuban refugees were reported to fall into Miami and 14 were reported to be dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of people before, and I'm sure this was not the last one.
Every year, more than 1 000 Mid-American immigrants die trying illegally to cross the United States border.
Because of the first city, they're ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that after reaching the first city in the country, few are planning to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, a platform upwards, or a place of recreation in waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're dying there, and as death approaches, many are planning to return to their homeland.
In the favoured cities of migrants, an unreasonably large number of people who are born and temporarily resident abroad continue to work.
It is estimated that 20 percent of the bodies of the dead in South Florida are flew elsewhere. The number is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human residues (HR, short form of the professional slang, human residues) are flying home from the Miami International Airport.
From 1964 onwards, the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the sector, says that around 80% of this transport is travelling abroad.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home will have its cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures of the table describe the human residues returned to the airline's homeland in 2013.
The return of bodies to the home country is not cheap: prices can vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements for human residues are also different.
At times, migrant migrant communities organise funeral communities to help with costs, because the restoration of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes have been created from such entities that were established by Italian, Jewish and Greek, the first group of migrants in the United States, in New York.
New generations of migrants from Mexico, China, the Philippines and Bangladesh are now the same in many of their popular cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties because few aliens are planning to make their last rest of the city.
For example, in Dubai, without a will for dead foreigners, the Sharia Law applies even though the laws on the recovery of the dead are different.
The entire assets of the dead are frozen and subsequently distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus (
2013) the scope reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and Ireland.
The airline interrupted the service, but reopened in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through the popular city of immigrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to a migrant city is an open declaration of the way of a migrant to look at life, not death.
However, death abroad means making the most powerful and irrevocable decisions on migrants — decisions on whether they want to be part of a local or global community, the universe or the country, the short term or eternal.
The Centre and the Left Alliance will issue a mid-term issue on inequality
The opposition parties in the centre and the Left Alliance intend to give the government an intermediate question of the income of low-income people and the increase of inequalities.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of the people's income, which are highlighted by poor economic development and deteriorating unemployment.
The growing inequalities are also seen between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, the parties are remarkable in the communication.
The government’s next year’s budget focuses on cuts and tax increases, according to the parties, on low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary jobs, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continues to be expensive.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their communications.
Workers also have worsened their income problems.
Parliamentary groups of the Centre and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party's basic Finns have already announced that they have submitted an interim question on police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary prosecution will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
The West Indian Day of New York City is about to begin
The Caribbean culture is once again in New York City, where West Indian Day is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there also politicians see each other and become seen.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It outlines the celebrations of traditional fast-time carnivals, and it is part of the dancers who carry complex, often made of molluscs.
The president of the Brooklyn region Eric Adams is the festival champion of this year, but there are also many other faces of politics that are known.
The parade is a great opportunity for the politicians who are present and candidates to welcome the public a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the celebrations, violence has also been included in the previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Is it even worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, don't they?
You shouldn't answer that question.
This language image, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests a specific response, tastes both high-speed speeches and a more daily exchange of expressions.
The prosecution of Ciceron's famous Catilina is a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, oh Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same is true of my wife's late questions: "Why can't I warm up five days old chickens for children?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for a rhetoric question.
The power of the Retorical question lies in the openness of the issue, and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
A mysterious rhetorical question suggests that no one who has a complete mind could agree with it.
David Williams, the author of the 19th century guide of material writing, described the question of the rhetoric, "some words that are wonderfully designed to produce a strong feeling of the truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they put forward is impossible to disagree."
Inflammation skills
Retorical questions can be asked afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of retorical questions that have been raised afterwards, designed to express grief or anger, are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you benefit from oppressing me --?
Do you have the same eyes as we do?
Do you see what a person sees?
The chains of rhetoric questions are also found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
You can't do anything right?
In addition, there is a hypophora, which is the case when you ask the question and answer it immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex horror for all women?
Parrot!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten and where have they been hurt?"
This chicken.
Who gave it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetoric question does not usually aim to persuade, even though retorics mean inclination skills.
If you are trying to talk to someone around, instead of trying to preach to those who have already been turned, or to be tempted of one’s stubbornness, you should use rhetoric questions in a saving way.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept their own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "And is not nice when it is so sunset?", the rhetoric question says that the speaker is sure of what he has said is more binding between the speaker and the public.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
Assuming that unanimity has been achieved instead of seeking unanimity, the speaker may seem, well, self-satisfactory.
In other situations, the rhetoric question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the headlines of the magazines, the question of the rhetoric is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens create pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question can lead to an answer which differs from the suggested answer.
"Are you thinking the same as us?" was part of the risky campaign clause of the British Conservative Party in the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
Some have had a hobby to find such cases, and the questions called QTWAIN (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No made known by the British journalist John Rentoul, the questions whose answer is not) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend arranged a competition looking for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do you Wanna Be In My Gang?", singed by the pop star Gary Glitter before he revealed himself as a sexual abuser of children.
The author has also written the book You Talkin' to Me?
Researcher: The time of the alliance compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal state could be a compromise to the conflict, said Saar.
In an interview with the Russian channel, President Vladimir Putin said earlier that the need for peace in Eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the east.
According to Saare, Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is, in a certain way, a priority for Russia's objectives.
Ukraine is certainly for a reason suspicious of Russia's efforts to influence the internal policy of Ukraine, he says.
If the federal solution is not reached, the second option from Russia could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia would in practice control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saar evaluates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has disputed the arguments, even though, for example, the Russian rebels themselves have said that their forces have fought "the voluntary Russian soldiers on leave".
Up's Director: Kataiselle's planned influential role
The brick reminds me that the project is new and still figuring.
He said that the idea is that Katainen would in some way coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
One of the priorities of the Commission's new programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That's how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says Tilekainen.
Delicious believes that the background, economic know-how and role of Cataine in the context of the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
The plans are designed to be carried out without a portfolio, i.e. Katais would not be subject to its own Directorate-General.
Instead, Catais would be a team driver in the field of competitiveness and employment in the EU, in which he could have portfolios in addition to the economic commissioner's portfolio as well as other portfolios in the field.
In practice, management of the team could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Military mothers: up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organisation, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine during the last two months, and there are currently more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers are dead.
According to the organisation, the Rostov City Hospital, near the border of Ukraine, has been targeted in the Ukrainian war.
Soldiers' mothers collect their data from soldiers' owners.
The Military Union NATO has estimated that there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Ande of his alcoholic use: "A little after a drink, there'll be a case."
The big brother Jussi and Andte went on Monday night to think about the BB house's life.
On Monday night, Jussi, on the basement, polished a fitness bike with Andte, one of the residents of Kartano.
Twenty-one wondered what they did in the viewers of the program.
Not that road until you've seen it, Andte said.
Juss thinks most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible celebrations or tasks only form part of the break-in part of the BB house's life.
It's more like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the map spent a Wednesday night in wet marks, and the alcohol was especially turned on to Andte's phone.
Jussi inquiry from Andtel, whether the party had made a man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had reached a small hipraka to talk to them with other inhabitants.
A little drink, and then there'll be a case, Andte admits.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Let Abreu expose his body in our women
Anna Abreu tells us in our Women's magazine that he decided to lose weight two years ago when he stayed on a break.
At that time, Anna, who was tired of greeting, thought he was diluted to gain more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Give me a dream a couple years ago about a body type of Victoria's Secret models.
My body design was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna's gonna tell the paper.
Anna, presenting his trained body on the work and music videos, says that there is no luster, even though he has been named like that.
Export The Knight River
In Timm, Anna trains at the gym and boxes.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can raise a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna notes.
Sometimes the pop star allows himself to deliciously delicious.
If I taste it, I'll really taste it.
Sometimes I pull unhealthy cowboys, and I don't wonder if there were more pounds.
Instead, I'm wondering what my body thinks.
I'm disgusting if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Companies’ profit sharing pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Did Australia’s heads of stock companies today just try to please a large crowd by contributing to shareholders' wishes from a larger distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is there any decision-making power to move from corporate governments to shareholders to which the government serves?
The profit distribution is most important, it was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of companies' shares which have rewarded investors in the form of repurchase programmes and by sharing more profits have clearly risen.
And there's nothing bad about it.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is reduced faster than analysts have predicted; this is why many ask whether the short-term popularity is underlined and is focused sufficiently on growth in the near future and long-term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more funding will be obtained from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds obtained from the loan markets would not be taken into account, it is clear that the openness of shareholders is financed, above all, because the company uses less money to invest.
The net result of the wave of these purchasing programmes (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this reporting period for the "capital reduction" period, during which companies have tried to keep the stocks small.
As part of the same plan, companies have increasingly less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was EUR 3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrecovered capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it sees capital consumption as a cheerleading in a headline of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
The director of the Australian Central Bank Glenn Stevens considered sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that firms need a little more "fighting spirit" in order to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual companies, but the overall impact on the economy, as the slow consumption of capital usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "the reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have decreased on average by 4% over the previous two years.
Estimates on free cash flow have increased on average by two per cent.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This rapid view seems good from the point of view of the current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some evidence of the obedience of companies.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of the stock is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
Managing directors are very closely following stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of managing directors are defined according to the value of shares and the status of managers depends on it.
Managing directors want to say that some decisions (whether they were business deals, increased investment in the organisation or profit distribution) are not necessarily immediately popular, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, corporate leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short view on the investment market.
Therefore, the scar of the current conservativeness feels to be granted to the short-term objectives.
However, in the very end of the reporting period, it was too clear that the weight was in reducing future capital consumption and the most sustainable companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also acted the same way – part of the force and partly because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, are investors pressing companies to share profits?
According to Hasan Tevfik, Credit Suisse's strategic strategy, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other traditional fixed-profit investment products have declined when, surprisingly, the central banks have reduced interest rates worldwide to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital markets to search for profits and, on the other hand, they are pressing companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made firms quite clear that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain distribution of profits.
Investors would prefer money as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics in the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits has led to a great deal in business cost cuts rather than a growth in turnover.
Cases of leakage of public naked images appear to be a breach of information or breaking into an e-mail account
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some of the sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet wonders about the information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicity persons in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the pictures described have announced that their images are fake, while others have said it was a long time ago deleted images.
There's a lot of films and it's said that Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And the pictures and videos were real, and where were they downloaded?
The most important source in the news is images – an unsatisfactory and in-depth attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most likely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in the information security teams working inside the house which are responsible for attempting to invade the company’s own systems regularly.
"The large-scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be true," notes Vice-President of the Information Safety Research Unit of Rik Ferguson, Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for hackerings related to these persons (and for hackings of less famous people every day) is the e-mail address and password leakage, either by guessing or by scaling information, i.e. by scaming a person to log in on a real-looking site, followed by these data are used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones to save the settings and above all to backup images when they are transferred to the cloud server.
The user's account can be registered in the iCloud service by providing this e-mail address and password, then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against entry into the account, in which case the owner's mobile phone is sent to the code before the account can be registered.
However, relatively few uses 2FA properties, either because it is not known, or because it is considered difficult.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information is from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely user accounts were intruded.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson believes it is possible that the hacker has used the "Unforget password" link in the Apple iCloud service by first collecting publicity addresses from the address book of another hacked device, for example.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were taken through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's pictures claims that the pictures are real, but he doesn't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacker company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long it took to have a terrifying trouble.
I feel sympathy for all the others who have been hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought to have removed the pictures from his mobile phone, but removing the picture from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly record images in the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones to record images for OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox offer automatic images and data storage service.
"People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that pictures are downloaded from the account," says Cluley to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees, "The deceased doesn't always mean to be deleted," he says.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone can access the user's e-mail address and password, he can reload all photos and videos that have been sent by email.
Apple's service pictures can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screening image that was alleged to be displaying videos and images that were not yet published from Windows PC.
Two-step identification is protected from such hacking because it requires everyone who is trying to copy an existing account to another device, to provide the original user's device, usually the code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer two-stage identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether these publicity persons used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that pictures in which they are claimed to be are not real.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the pictures in which Grande is claimed to be are "fullly fake."
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweet: "The naked images that I took are naked, you don't understand.
Let me cut off the rumors right now.
Cluley's going to bring out another option.
Since the hacker was targeted by persons of publicity, their accounts could have been breached by someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly arranged their e-mails.
"I would like to know if an actor's agencies or a representative are part of the matter," she will consider.
However, these persons do not use one publisher or an agency.
The second option is that someone who installed one or more systems or helped configure it and secretly changed the system so that all information can be returned.
This happened in the case of the florida named "Hollywood hacker" in the case of Christopher Chaney, where the hacker distributed pictures from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis e-mail accounts in 2011, and he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of entering more than 50 enterprise e-mail accounts secretly between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in a small clothing name of this stylist and then published the photos online.
Chaney apologized later, saying that his actions were probably one of the worst insults of privacy that you can imagine.
Chaney was also claimed to spy on the Internet for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, stars were broken into e-mail accounts, and they were changed so that someone also sent their information forward after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the obsession of hackers breaking into these accounts is "remembering the gathering of butterflies".
They just want to collect such information.
It is possible that in this case, someone had encountered a list of information and logging information on these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
The hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time
or have access to information on an e-mail account, such as the address book, and then fished for information from other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to help the UN to track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped in Syria by the terrorists associated with Al-Qaida.
The terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, believed to be held prisoners of 44 Fiji peacekeepers. This terrorist group conquered the crossing point in the Golan hill last week and forced the UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information on where they are.
At the same time, ministers participating in the UN's small developing island countries' conference, including Minister of Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and he has provided Australia's assistance to save the lost peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the United Nations in everything that it can, e.g. through the assistance of the intelligence service," she said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We will be very firmly in contact with all the collaborative aspects of the intelligence network and friends -- to ensure that we can track them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced Fidži's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position at the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines peacekeeping group held captive in their military armies was reported as fleeing in different parts of the same controversial region.
The UN has supervised the Golan hills since the 1974 fire break in Syria and Israel.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money through the coal tax waiver initiative, warns the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The scamsters use the decoupling initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit of Competition has warned consumers and businesses to rely on the excessively sound offers of government agencies, which provide compensation for thousands of dollars.
Cheaters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save for buying goods after the coal tax is repealed and offering it up to $7 000, says the warning.
Cheaters may sound very convincing because they have discovered the victim’s personal data they use to try to obtain bank information or to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing topical issues to cheat the victim.
Cheaters use more than a coal tax fraud to get access to money, their stories are more advanced, and they use the timely things to build a scam around them.
Also, the lost machine at MH370 by the Malaysia Airlines airline and the death of Robin Williams have inspired cheaters.
The ACCC advises the company to contact the contact details of the caller instead of the contact information itself, where there is no doubt about the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you get an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of the coal tax, be careful.
If you believe that you have been cheated and given personal information or transferred money to the cheater account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true, for example, the free money shared by the government, it is likely that it is.
Households: Lipponen blames the EU's Russian sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU to Russia in the Interview of Economic Nominations.
Russia's policy focus is on its own interests.
The sanctions do not necessarily work on this," says Lipponen in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a clearer of the business of the EC Arctic regions.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD and the European Investment Bank, suspended Russia's project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects of the Northern Dimension, with clear outlook, go to ice," says Lipponen in the interview.
The freezing of funding now is a detrimental factor in cooperation which Lippose believes to be difficult if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation in the Ice Sea region continues as large as before.
He is currently examining the EC on the Arctic policy of Finland and the opportunities for businesses in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The study will take a long way forward, talk about ten years," he says.
It is rare that an elephant is coming to a low water or close to an institution, says Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Museum of North of North.
At Vaasa Suvilahde, the elephant was seen floating near the beach today on Sunday.
According to the weakness, the elephant has probably come after the Suvilahti food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone's tip.
He said, for example, at the Sundom Bridge, it will be seen especially in the springs and in the autumn of the Norp, who will arrive precisely after the fish.
Norpe is still not a common species in the Vaasa Sea region.
In the country where they pay, they see Norp at the halls of the villas, he continues.
Norp lives, among other things, in the Baltic Sea and the Saaristo Sea.
According to the South Australian court, assassin Robert Vallelonga was aggressive and violent outside the night club.
Assassinated South Australian pizzerianomist Robert Vallelonga.
In the court hearing, Robert Vallelonga was aggressive to both his partner and security officer for minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
In the lower court of Vallelonga, the defendant's attorneys asked for the release of their client against the guarantees, because it was "explicitly" for self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind the prison until the trial.
"The evidence shows that the dead were so aggressive that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, a squirrel began, resulting in this 40-year-old humiliated man -- ripped off the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death caused one strike, which clearly refers to self-defense or defending another.
A 25-year-old man is only accused of killing.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconsciously near Rundle St and Synagogue Place on the 4th of May at about 2.25 p.m., with serious head trauma.
He died of his injuries in the Royal Hospital of Adelaide the next day, and friends and clients in the pizzeria left the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the action of the murder, and after the case, he had said to the taxi driver, "he put someone in bed for a few days."
But the video of the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead acted aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and gained a share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client's side is both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of a man because only one of the three security guards in the night of the accident had been involved in Vallelonga’s behavior.
According to them, other security guards did not consider him to be threatened because "it was short," and he used a large man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that also the taxi driver who clearly saw the case would prove that Vallelonga was "powerfully" hit and did not have the opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week he declared his decision.
The controversial delfin hunt began in Japan as a tradition of the foreign news - the evening-Sanomas
The bad weather was expected to postpone the world’s widespread hunting.
The annual hunting season of delfins began again Monday in Taiji, Japan.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
Among other things, the British Journal Guardian reports a massive opposition to the yachts around the world.
In hunting, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into an outer bay where mammals are slaughtered after the choice of the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The meat of the dolphins also ends as food.
According to local authorities, however, the beginning of hunting was expected due to a delay in bad weather.
Knowledge of practice was spread to the world in 2009 with the documentary film The Cove.
During the previous hunting seasons, hunting has been criticised not only by the animal protectors but also by the diplomats.
According to the opposers, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to those defending hunting, the Japanese government also reads it, it is a tradition.
The defendants have also reminded us that dolphins are not threatened.
During the weekend, dolphin hunting was resisted by demonstration in several countries.
According to protesters in Tokyo, the hunt damages the reputation of Japan in the world.
Also in Helsinki, a demonstration was held on Monday before the Japanese embassy.
Some of NATO's Member States are uncertain about investing new forces in Eastern Europe
The Military Alliance within NATO is divided into whether NATO should be founded in Eastern Europe and Baltia as a response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times newspaper.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military union to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russia's policy and threatens to deplete European security," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
The NATO Member States are gathering in the week they start, and the military union is to publish its new preparedness plan.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can break the TTA agreement signed in 1990 on conventional weapons.
It is where NATO and the Warsaw Alliance agree how they place armed forces in an area between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not really quit the agreement.
In view of the uprising situation in Ukraine, NATO will consider whether the terms of the agreement still need to be met.
"Woman's resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the British Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest flying around the world
When the other teenagers learned how to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
The 19 - year - old Guthmiller became the youngest flying around the world – and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man in South Dakota flew 30 000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 countries in five different continents.
On their way, Guthmiller was treated as rock star thanks to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Like risky," and "Somebody twisted, rich puppy just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Mr Guthmiller had little to say to the speakers of such comments.
Of course, I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that by my record I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight inspiration started early, and first he asked his parents to go to the airport cafeteria.
Later, he asked me to get to the flight class.
My parents let me go to a short, $20, 20-minute meeting flight, but I think they thought at that time that my enthusiasm would stop.
He didn't stop.
Soon after that, Guthmiller made a deal with his parents that would allow him to have more time at the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father all the time in high school instead of getting my own car.
In the exchange store, I could fly planes.
By 17 years of age, Guthmiller had received a flight permit and two years later he leased a single-powered Beechcraft airplane for his own flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT High School himself took care of the aeroplane and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours at the top, it also meant that he himself needed an additional tank...
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he had eaten a few inventors completely during a long flight.
Flying to the cloud was amazing and scary.
Air traffic directors in other countries did not have any adjustments to help them navigate around storms.
I had no idea what clouds were just a little above the plane and what they were up to 45,000 feet and tear a plane into pieces.
Guthmiller's plane wasn't pressurized and there was no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The number of fuels in the machine would never have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman died after his plane fell between the American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls for the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Sulema, and he believes that the rising phase is technically challenging because of the high amount of fuel needed for 16 hours of flight.
Despite the dangers and even the horror of the high place, however, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He's the coder himself, and he set up his own company when he was 12 years old.
Guthmiller's goals are here in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but now we'll see what happens.
Guthmiller's going to be staring high anyway.
Target to heaven, and you can achieve something great.
It's harder to find a real franchise company than you think.
Lori Joyce was enthusiastic on the line of fans in his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the start of the Canadian W TV channel to show the Cupcake Girls TV in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one of the franchise companies was not suitable for the task.
"My company in France sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are waiting outside the store to buy a cupcake, and she doesn't take the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the management skills of the company, rather than baking skills, from the selection process of the franchise partners.
"Whoever can shine in the interview -- they know what I want to hear", he says, adding that he's been having about a hundred interviews for each 11 franchise movements.
We start with six weeks of training, but workers work completely differently in the working environment themselves, so the whole process is rather difficult, and that is why education is primarily emphasised by the suitability of business culture.
Finding a real franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to edit and increase the organisation, while a poorly appointed leader can cause expensive damage to the company.
"I thought that looking for a franchise company is like dating, but it's not true, you can do a lot to get to know someone before you get married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a permanent agreement is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new sale is being built.
Being a partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and a significant confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship between the French partners is similar to a strong marriage, with common objectives, explains the President of Lorraine McLachla, the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA) and the CEO.
Therefore, McLachlan believes that the French entrepreneur should also be careful in choosing the future franchise donor before taking such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as the relationships: if a date is rude already on a date, imagine what she's like in a marriage?" she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contracting partner and to draw attention to the smallest alarm marks on both sides.
McLachlan adds that franchise donors such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those who act as a franchise donor must be more careful when choosing the first, the most important partners.
On the other hand, the new franchise donors must conclude that they are likely to have succeeded on the basis of the parent company, what challenges they have faced and what skills the new franchise entrepreneur needs in the face of similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise donors can also ask for help from a franchise advisor to create a sector-based profile.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time, people who act as franchise donors and entrepreneurs have a great deal of help at the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
The process will, however, become easier later because French donors learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first French companies can provide advice and help in assessing them.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) to make a significant contribution to this company and franchise system," says Erik Church, O2E Brands. The O2E Brands company includes 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The French entrepreneurs helped Brian to create something that he could not have created alone, so the first franchise companies must choose this idea in mind.
Under Church, there are 216 franchise companies representing all three O2E brands, and he is also a French partner of the You Move Me Company.
Chruch's method of finding a real franchise partner is simple.
"Sometime we have a confidence test to ask ourselves, 'Do I invite this person to me for the weekend barbecue?' he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend a large part of your working day looking for solutions to major business challenges with them."
Church also points out that O2E Brands is largely thanks to its franchise structure for its success.
In the company organisation, leaders often see their position in short-term terms and relationship to the lower management level as very official, while the French companies are taking a long-term partnership and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The French partnership has much more good than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This is the partnership, not the relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational leader.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but, well done, it produces better results.
Railway delays lower the prices of cereals in the North of the United States
The delayed train transport has led to a significant drop in the prices of cereals in the North Central of the United States, weeks before a massive harvest is expected to be under a new pressure on the transport network.
Commercial grain siles in the North Dakota state provide farmers only $2.7 for bushel - about a dollar less than the steering prices - for the cost of ensuring the capacity of train tracks, traders and agricultural organisations, above all.
IN Raw material
The problems are the most acute Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway with BNSF railways and the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Controller organises consultations on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, railways must be used in the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
The delays in rail transport increased when the high harvest in 2013 was followed by a very cold winter which caused the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from North Dakotan Bakken's oil liqueur has excluded the transport of cereals, which is not true by railway companies.
According to a manager of an international cereal trade company, the costs of grain-storing and transferring sellers to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to $2,000 to $3,000 a year.
Someone has to pay the expenses.
"This costs are payable either by the farmer or by the client," says the manager of the cereal trader.
The US Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota's soybean beans grow by over a third and the spring crop by 16%.
Randy Gordon, President of the National Organisation for Cereals and Feed (National Grain and Feed Association), says: "We normally try to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e. a sufficient storage space has been emptyed for the harvest and the cereals have been sold and transferred.
But now we are going to start late because of the problems with the service of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will deal with the transport of this year’s harvest smoothly.
Vice-President John Miller, responsible for the transport of BNSF agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the long-term transport (the customers ordered train wagons for which more than four days have passed) from the silk of April, 16 500, to about two thousand.
"We have moved almost everything from the old crop that we were meant to move," Miller says, referring from the previous crop to the surplus grain.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF cereal trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller acknowledges that the development is "small" but notes that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all transported products, such as grey congestion.
The speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company with problems due to the second suma are 11 per cent lower than the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds in the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has told the Railway Controller (Surface Transportation Board) that the changes made to its Train Vehicle Order System should improve its capacity to handle traffic by 15-20% in the coming harvest period.
"The autumn action plan of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains, so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week," said the representative of the railway undertaking.
The Ukrainian crisis may resolve NATO's 'identity crisis'
The leaders, diplomats and experts in large countries have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether NATO's mission to Afghanistan ends itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as appears at the NATO Summit in Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama in the United States.
The list of politicians and diplomats is no longer absent from the world's crises, even to the extent that the removal of the Afghan forces, which had prioritised, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, 28 States' alliances are needed after Russia has reinvaded Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that threats to Europe's independence are not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also move forces, promise more money for defence expenditure and responsive to defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for some kind of purpose -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis", says Heather Conley, Head of the European Programme for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to make the world leaders come up with a common strategy to defeat the militias of the Islamic State quickly reaching popularity in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in attempting to inspire his bored partners to enter the military response, particularly those who would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama has pressures to show that he will lead the world to find a strategy to win the extreme Islamists, after first saying directly that we have no strategy.
The Western experts have set careful expectations for the summit as to whether the Ukraine or the Islamic State will reach breakthroughs.
Additional economic sanctions are designed as the main means of punishing the event called the attack of Ukraine in Russia.
The officials of the European Union handled the matter this weekend, but they postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries of which Obama wishes the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be anticipated two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was held by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, President Robert M. Gates used his last speech to say that the organisation has almost reached the point of 'a common military insignificance'.
The US officials kept complaining that other countries were not able to achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to use 2% of their gross domestic product for defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this objective last year.
Now, however, the White House officials say that they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign a agreement in Cardiff which promises to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there was a genuine desire for the Member States to face the potential threats in their real size.
Following Russia's entry into Ukraine, the Union's 'defense promises are more important and more important than once after the end of the cold war', says Charles Kupchan, Director-General of the US National Security Council.
We are quite hoping that we will achieve a consensus between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of its journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation in the interests of the neighbouring countries concerned in Russia.
The President will start his triple-day visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet both the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian leaders.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia after Russia joined the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new, this week's publication preparedness plan is introduced.
The plan aims at shortening the time NATO needs to respond to the attacks in the border countries, says officials.
The plan will include the addition of air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes hold a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of kindness towards Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not actually break the agreement, but it can also be merely a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be appointed to the public in the course of the discussions before official information.
NATO's presence will probably be described as long-term, not permanent, said the diplomat.
On Putin, is he using an effective "talviase" to use it in Ukraine?
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is one of his ants with regard to Ukraine.
Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin for the rebel weapons of East Ukraine and for the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine is tightened, western countries plan harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a power card: the winter is coming, and the main energy source of Ukraine is Russia.
According to the US authorities, the primary energy sources of Ukraine are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, which is active at the University of Harvard, writes according to Business Insider.
When the winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country’s conflict, the Ukrainians are freezing in their homes when the gas supply is withdrawn from Russia.
Therefore, if rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov will write.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid invoices.
Previously on this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt of gas was EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the next winter as follows:
I think that no one will think about it (talve) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate abolition of hostilitys and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to recomplete stocks, the necessary corrections must be made and prepared for a cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
In the last month, Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company from Nomura, pointed out that Russia's talks on humanitarian affairs and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will grow in a few months if Russia can maintain the operation of the separatists until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine must pay advances for future gas supplies unless Kiev is in charge of accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate a contract that would allow gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseni Jatsenjuk, said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said that the speeches are incomplete.
He said that Russia will do everything it can to ensure that gas is delivered to EU countries.
The Liberal Saudi Blogar was given 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand blows.
The Saudi Arab Court has maintained a ten-year prison sentence for Raif Badaw, which was established by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The judgment includes a thousand fines and a million rials (approximately EUR 200 000) fines as an additional penalty.
The judgment was based on the fact that he had established a website that degrades Islam.
On Monday, the judgment was reported to AFP by the second founder of the organization, Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in July 2013 and 600 of the transhipment, but the judgment was complained and returned to referral.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when it was also noted by Amnesty International on its injustice.
Madventures Riku Ranta's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the devastating human encounters"
Today, Madventures published a new book World Explanation - An adventurer's explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Rantala an explanation of the future of the world and of the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most important human encounter in your life.
The writer, editor, the other side of Madventures, Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today, a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie tour of citizens, and on Wednesday, the second production period of Docventures will begin at the top.
Ever since the morning, he's been running from one place to another.
From the Maikker's morning night, the child is taking to the daycare and from there into the weekly house.
A face-to-face interview needs to be transferred for a phone interview.
I don't have time.
In the middle of all the rush he and the second half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation Book, which, according to the cover text, is the adventurer’s manual for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than the other, why we are here and who we are.
We've benefited from interviews we've been doing over the years.
In the book, experts are both professors and artists.
We actively worked the book for about a year, Riku will tell the IS by phone.
You've got a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the most important message of the book?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions should be considered, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book’s idea is to be a good reader, but it also aims to get people at home to discuss and share ideas.
The debate can even lead to action, Riku tells.
DESCRIPTION: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of your books is the future of the world.
How does it look?
We ended up in the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the present state of the earth, it is imperative to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosopher.
Riku tells us that some research indicates that Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This concludes that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
That is why we want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
The use of our natural resources will not be enough for a long time, says Riku.
You also consider the differences between cultures in your book.
How does an Indian man differ from a Finnish man?
People don't differ much.
Of course, the starting points are different in relation to education, health and hygiene.
The most culturally important difference is that the Community is much greater in India in good or bad.
Once western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Segregation of others and may lead to loneliness and tribulation.
When we find a proper balance between sociality and loneliness, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku will tell you.
Riku has encountered a lot of different people in the world.
What's the best way to meet people is to meet him?
It is my childhood when I was with my family on the first major foreign trip.
We lived in India and Pakistan when my father was there for the United Nations.
I was seven years old and two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku popped.
They came home to Finland with a big moving car.
We drove into war in Afghanistan when there were huge numbers of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl my age walked on the road carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on the bench of the big bench in my hand.
Our eyes were facing, Riku describes.
A child of your age will realize the situation.
It was one of the devastating human encounters that I always remember.
DESCRIPTION: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna in 2013 at bookshops.
Then Rikulla went to the cabbage, that other people should be respected, even if they were considerably poorer or they would not have the same conditions of life as we do.
Riku already realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of the adults, people who are faced in New Guinea come to the surface.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials for everything, they do not use money or metal tools.
They live under extremely challenging conditions of life.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think.
And to think about it, he and Tunna want to have their new book readers too.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen to more.
That it would make people work for warm love to discuss or even to fight fists, Riku's throwing.
That's what Kauhajoki magazine says.
Eventually, the couple arrived at the bus station and ordered a taxi.
When the cab went off, the man in the yard threw a taxi on some object.
The driver got out of the car, and the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the item stabbed the man's traveler life-threateningly to the head and to the hand and left the place.
The stabber is a 170-175 cents tancat, a short-hair man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blond woman near the scene.
They're hoping he'll be in touch with the police.
The police are also asking for clues from all those who may have made observations of events or of persons involved in the case.
The stabbing took place on Wednesday 27 August at 19.50.
"Hey!" said to the brain the world's first telepathic message went through the Internet.
The publication of science PLoS ONE has published an article that says that the international group of researchers has first managed to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. Spanish and Italian.
The test was carried out by monitoring the electrical brain curve of the sender person.
The consignor was trained to send bits by thinking of the movement of the hand or leg.
The design of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and moving the hands into the first.
This bit coded data was sent through the Internet to the recipient.
The receiver was detected by magnetic stimulation of light extinguishing from each one of the coded bits.
The receiver was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still the area of research in their childhood shoes, but they believe that computer-guided telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Sanctions - Point - Earth's Future
The EU is preparing for new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also blackmailing its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia wars in Ukraine and occupies Crimea.
In international policy, the action is followed by a reaction, acting countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be bitten in the long term.
Iran was only able to enter into negotiations on its nuclear programme after years.
The South African Racial Orthodox Government sat in place for decades, even though trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions against Russia have also been made.
During the cold war, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take high-electronic or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time we were in the woods, we were freezing the raw wood trade.
It is clear that by sanctions, Russia will not be made on its knees.
The Russians have been used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to prohibit imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians want to drink the vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take aircraft to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The major disadvantage for Russia is not to cease imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The most damaging is the financial sector's limitations.
It's only going to affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It's got to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge foreign reserves, they do not stand for eternity.
The loan of Russian firms is sneaking and money is costing.
Your own banks can't finance everyone.
More money must be weighed, or companies will have difficulties in paying.
The bankruptcy is competition in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia's modernisation will stop, as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in the Helsinki News.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At the very least, Russia would return to Russia once again and swing in.
An exceptional free button event was held in North Korea.
Approximately 10,000 North Koreans followed the international free wrestlings held in Pjongjang on Saturday, and a number of diplomats followed.
An event organized by Antonio Inoki, a Japanese wrestler, who became a free wrestler, took part in wrestlings from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the free button games, taekwondo matches were also seen for local athletes.
According to Inok, the purpose of the event was to bring the conflicting countries closer to and promote world peace through sport.
In their speeches, the politicians wished for improvement between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed sanctions that it had imposed to North Korea as a result of the Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
On the other hand, North Korea promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
The last time in North Korea, an international free wrestling was seen in 1995.
SOK reduces about 110 persons from the organisation of the commercial use.
The joint negotiations started in June, when a reduction was assessed as a maximum of 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been dismantled by duplication and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK explains that it is explicitly seeking better cost efficiency and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the decline in economic downturn and the demand for consumers, there is a structural change in trade, which has shaken particularly the commodity trade.
The result of the use of the group S commodity trade has been lost for some time.
The joint negotiations covered all employees and management of the SOK’s daily and commercial assets trade, i.e. around 530 persons.
Turku Sanoms: Part of self-medicines behind the dish
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines that can be obtained without a prescription, but only after consulting a pharmaceutical staffer.
According to the Finnish Pharmaceutical Union, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could be consulted.
After an interview with a pharmaceutical or proviisor and in compliance with the predefined criteria, the medicine should be given behind the dish, the Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Union will consider Kirsi Kvarnström Turku Sanom.
There are already a few people in Finland without a prescription, but a medicine that needs advice.
One of these is a retreatment preparation.
Corruption for more specific causes
Finland is increasingly paying attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is astonishing the lack of bribes and sentences in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice Working Group will consider whether the provisions of the Criminal Act would require trade and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the case of the Slovenian branch of Patria's bribe in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The trade in influence brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister in Slovenia, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal names.
The Anti-Corruption Cooperation Network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the newly completed survey, bribery is not much studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the University of Police for Corruption in various areas.
Messi potee Nivusvamma - Sports - Karjalainen
Captain Lionel Messi of the Argentine Football Team is out of the middle week's painting against Germany.
The Messi keeps a nail injury on the side of the viewer, told her to join Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona thinks it's a precaution on the side of the Mess.
The Messiah insulted the feather at the Sunday's league match against Villareal.
Barcelona won the 1-0.
The Messiah also missed the charity match in Rome.
Mr. Wanderers Coach, Tony Popovic believes he's going to get tutors into the Asian Champions League fight in Korea.
Tony Popovic's missing three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned at the first match, and coach Tony Popovic has no suspicion to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witches in the FC Seoul game.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a ten-day training camp, including two friendship matches in Abu Dhab so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match of 17 September.
Due to the excessive yellow cards Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip the Korean journey, but Coach Popovic believes in their hikers.
"Of course, this is a loss – they have been three very important players at ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
It is a retreat, none of the players should be gone, but we did not have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes to replaces, he must have worked a lot, and I trust the entire team.
I'm not afraid of just playing against who in the semifinals.
The Wanderers must also be without Spiranovicia, which is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The Soccerosis team defender was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play a return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back on career and he's recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already practiced out a couple of times, which is good.
It's gonna take a while before he's completely fine, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the top world spaces at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that travel to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes in the end of the last year.
"We know this will help players to create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on the field and outside it.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
An elite hamburger pays three times the monthly salary of a worker
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the elite of the country.
The Financial Times tells us about the economy that has ripped the opposites.
In North Korea, the unofficial market may prosper more than ever.
They offer to wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens a luxury that has not been used to combine with the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited the Munsu Water Park: amusement centre, where only the access ticket pays up to ten months' regular employee salary.
They're gonna get hamburgers. They're gonna pay $76.
It's a 3-5 month salary for the country's normal dunari.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's 'western markets' began in the 1990s, when the country suffered famine.
The government will allow them to exist, even though the price of supplies can be the worst.
Yet, in the capital of Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a door of $200.
The cause may be a ruler in Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create a self-energy and young image.
During his time, the administration has emphasised the importance of technology in the flowering of the country.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hope for sales
The Stormont Council hopes that it has found a buyer to Ormiston House, a building in Belfast, which cost taxpayers almost GBP 3 000 a week.
The Council bought a building from the 18th century in the east of the city 13 years ago and paid 9 million pounds of it.
The Council failed to further sell the building, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about 400 pounds per day.
The building was sold with 1,25 million pounds a year ago.
It is apparent that the building will be used as a private housing building.
The Council bought the building classified in class B from historic value with 9 million pounds in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building it was re-entered at the price of GBP 2.5 million this time.
The building was not sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party suggested that Ormiston House might agree to the premises of the new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as soon as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker shall remain silent on the identity and sales price of the buyer.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormiston House are about GBP 3 000.
The Council bought a building from the police forces, which proceeded to the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
By the beginning of this year, the safety costs of Ormiston House were GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs of GBP 371 379.
The price of repair and maintenance professional services was GBP 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were GBP 212 466.
The building was previously owned by Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was bought by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie's death, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
"Speciality is increasing": Helsinki intends to reduce school supporters
There's no savings, says JHL.
Helsinki prepares a radical reduction in the number of school-specific school attendance grants.
The reduction would not concern the child’s personal assistant.
The Helsinki Education Board ended up in spring to present around 2.7 million outlets of school attendance assistance resources.
A total of about 600 school entrants are available in Helsinki.
If the reductions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately at the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, this decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce the savings, as the amount of education aid is not clearly defined in the law.
There is no guarantee that savings will be borne, and the workload of the educational staff will increase.
For school people, savings are increasing the risk of dropping from the objectives of learning and the survival of teachers is hard, highlighting the JHL's Director-General, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki inequality schools, as the small schools and pupils in the future resources no longer receive assistant resources.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
The resulting preventive work is just done by school entrants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Educational Agency are mostly aimed at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
In autumn the City Council of Helsinki will make a final solution to the resources, to which I hope the vision and wisdom to look forward to the future and act in accordance with its objectives, notes Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers the Land on the West Coast
Israeli women walk in the Jewish dwelling called Gevaot, near Bethlehem, in the Etzion district.
On Sunday, Israel occupied nearly 400 hectares of land in the Jewish region of the West Coast near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, while at the same time despairing the Palestinians’ request not to build more dwellings and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposed the extension of the West Bank authorities, believed that Sunday events could be the largest single takeover of the land in the West Bank for decades and could "dramaticly change the situation in the region".
The Palestinian objective is to establish a country for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political urge to assess the situation in the land came after three young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they lifted the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested the Palestinians who were accused of the main cause of kidnapping and killings.
The timing of the takeover of the land makes it understand that it was intended to be a kind of compensation for the population of housing and punishment for the Palestinians.
It was a necessary step to enable Israel to start planning buildings in the region when it was willing to start planning, near the use of the Jewish Gevaot in the South Jerusalem region of Etzion.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of Surifi, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the land belonged to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday provisions in which Israel announced that they would take over the lands of the olive and other tree crops of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objection should be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led to Israel’s army in the West Coast a discipline against the Islamic Group of Gaza, which Israel says was behind the abductions.
The following tensions at the borders of Israel and Gaza rose into a 50 - day war that ended last week in the firebreak of Egypt.
The occupation of the land has quickly given attention to the Western coast of the Israelites and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government which make the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process difficult.
Lapland’s crises are usually multi- problematic
More and more of the municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, it is reflected in a well-being study carried out by Lapland University and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no rapid solutions to crisis problems.
According to the Professor, it is not enough to reduce the tasks of municipalities by EUR billion.
The common features of crises include weak municipal economies, poor employment and migratory losses.
According to Professor Asko Suikkasen, the sociology professor at the University of Lapland is coming from the western border and East Lapland.
In the survey, residents are very realistic about the situation of their municipality.
In the study, the residents of well-being municipalities even viewed the prospects pessimisticly.
The short expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the current day and prosperity will survive, perhaps even a little.
In this time, there is no dare to think about long-term investment, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
A group of researchers surprised the huge differences between the municipalities.
For example, the cost of income allowances per capita varies from a couple of ten to a wide range of over 100 euros.
The tax revenues received by municipality per capita vary from Ranua from EUR 2 000 to EUR 4400.
According to the smoker, Lapland's municipalities are different.
How money is spent, how much government shares can be gained and what is the level of debt is much different in similar situations, he says.

UK may close borders from returning Islamic fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters who departed in Iraq and Syria from their homeland.
The BBC is referring to the sources of government.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism should retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is being finalised and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain increased the possibility of terrorism to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from libyan prison.
The Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from libyan prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Representative of Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all is going well" and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released from the care of the Australian authorities this evening, and then he will rise to a flying plane in Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," commented the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before he continues his journey to Hague.
Taylor and three of his judiciary colleagues were arrested in the city of Zintan in Liberia on 7 June in representing Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddaf of the former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took papers to Seif, which they believe threatened with national security.
Senator Carr has been working hard to release Taylor, including travelling to the capital of Libya to Tripoli last month to drive this issue.
Taylor couldn't have spoken to her husband or her little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke to parents living in Taylor Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had begged Libya to release his daughter before this little child’s third birthday in July.
Three other lawyers in the Criminal Court are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that the discussion between the lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities "the lawyer of the Criminal Court was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly after its members return to their home.
"After its investigations have been decided by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong will be judged properly," the Court announced last month.
The International Criminal Court demands a trial to Seif Al-Islama, 39 years of age, against crimes against humanity during the period of his father's administration, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and on 1 May announced that he did not accept the decision of the Criminal Court of Justice to hold a trial in Hague.
The young newer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took his second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easily Villarreal did not fall at his home.
The blue ones hit their heads with the Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjoon until the 82th minute finally succeeded.
The winner made a surprising man: a 19-year-old, first-off attacker in La Liga, Sandro Ramirez had only arrived at the field 12 minutes earlier.
A young man who received a call from the Barcelona Second Team was close to finishing after Asenjo rejected Lionel Mess's company.
The collections to the Ferguson police were mysterious after a $433 000 overrun.
Survivors closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after collecting sites for more than $400 000 to a policeman who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missour's state.
On an open GoFundMe goodwill website, two separate pages carried similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected $235 750 and $620 for a ferguson policeman who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site held by Brown's family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by many weeks of unrest and demonstration, mostly by black people, against almost white police forces in Ferguson, which forced Wilson to hide while the local and federal investigations attempted to determine whether he shot Brown without a reason.
The collection campaigns of the network have led to some inconvenience on defending Wilson, especially since some of the visitors on the page had written comments on racist comments that have been deleted.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations at the same time on Saturday, and the site managers did not give the reasons for it.
When visiting on the site, he sees a message that says, "The gifts are no longer accepted!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of the GoFundMe site gave the Los Angeles Times a notice that the site has not prevented the provision of donations.
"Each organiser of the GoFundMe campaign decides when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, representative of the GoFundMe website.
Organisers may, if they want to, continue receiving donations later.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197 $620, maintains the St. Louis police charity group of Shield of Hope, which is the recipient of donations accepted by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, registered as official representatives in the collection register of the state of Shield Hope, did not respond on Sunday to e-mails asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official reporter of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missour House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, which uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe website assured The Times that anonymous goodwill exists.
A small number of information has been given to donors about anonymous charity campaign, unlike those on the other Wilson page or on the Brown Gift site.
Anonymous Wilson page charity wrote to visitors two weeks ago a message that the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope to become officially accepted donation recipients.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The charter provided more information to visitors who wished to have a Gmail e-mail address, but did not immediately respond to the request for more information on Sunday.
In his announcement to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe page said that an anonymous collection site has been deleted from the search results of the main site and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website, which should be used to have a functional Facebook account".
The GoFundMe website's information security practices call on users to "spend only to GoFundMe users who they know personally and to whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is correct and honest.
According to Mr Little, however, GoFundMe has "contacted with the campaign organiser and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to initiate studies in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds collected by this campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", who has organised campaigns to support Wilson, told the following people this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "sound" why the donors of the GoFundMe site were prevented from donating, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
