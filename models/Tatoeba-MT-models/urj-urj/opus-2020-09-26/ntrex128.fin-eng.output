The members of the Wales Representatives are afraid to look like fools.
Some Members of the Parliament of Wales are confused on the proposal that their title should be changed by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was the beginning of the plan to change the name of the representative body to the House of Wales.
The members of the delegation are concerned, irrespective of the party's position, that the change can cause them to be mocked.
According to a working party's representative, the group is concerned about the name "rim with words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group takes the name change to "open mind", but notes that the word MWP has a short words on the word of foolishness.
In the Wales language, the W letter is expressed in the same way as the Yorkshire U letter.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative amendment necessary for the change in name, stated: "The final decision on the titles of the members of the delegation, of course, belongs to the Members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorises the representative to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the opinion on the proposals that the appointment of the representatives to the Wales Parliament would benefit from broad support.
The Commission favoured the names of the members of the delegations as the title of the Wales Parliament or the abbreviation of the WMP, but the MWP option was best supported by the public opinion.
The members of the Parliament are obviously proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can lead to a major problem for President Elin Jones, who is expected to change the legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Legislation on amendments also includes other changes to the activities of the representative bodies, such as rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative process, the members of the Assembly may give their final vote on the title to which they should be called.
The Macedonians are going to the Elections in the referendum on change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether the name of the country is changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the controversial neighbouring country with Greece for decades, which also has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has repeated for a long time that the name of the Northern Neighbourhood is practically a regional requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, has said that he should ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaevi reasonably argue that the change in name is simply a price for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins' watches slow down when Harlem Churches live in difficult times
"Each person with whom I have spoken says that before every corner of the street was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"There's no one here."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The relationship with people has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighborhood, where people meet regularly."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the sale of the property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the exit box."
He added that churches can be replaced by housing houses and apartments that are not the people who would support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The most people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white people," he says, "and that's how they will force up the day when these churches close their doors permanently, because it's unlikely that most people moving into these apartments would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlem became a black residential area - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original Methodist congregation of white men moved away.
A nearby congregation of black people acquired a building for their own.
St Martinsin took over the Black Church under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, and he led the bocott to the traders of Harlem's main commercial street in 125th Street against the recruitment or promotion of these opposed blacks.
In 1939, the fire burned the building badly damaged, and when Father Johnson’s congregation members designed to rebuild, they introduced a tower watch game.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clocks.
The expert called the Torniello game in July called it a "cultural treasure" and "uncompensated historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the world's first tower watch game called by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who changed to play a bigger tower watch game in Riverside 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, the last few months, there has been a complex rift that has contributed to the work of architects and contractors hired by the church’s world leaders on the one hand and by the episcopal hippopotamus on the other.
In July, the Governing Body of the Sakastican Heads of the Congregation wrote to the hippie expressly his concern that the hippie would "engagement costs" to the sack even though the sack had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the hippie.
Some congregations complained about the lack of transparency in the sneaking system.
Shark damaged a 13-year-old lobster in California.
Officials say that the hail attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him when he dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diegon KSWB that he and his friends dived on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel first said he thought that the boy was just excited after catching the lobster, but then he realized this screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole collar bone had been torn open.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flighted to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked ha is not known.
In a media event, Captain of the Rescue, Larry Giles said that a shark had been detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found to be a dangerous species.
Giles added the victim's severe injuries on his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 fishermen in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the United Kingdom's beauty care sector
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the goods industry with specialist counselors.
This is a significant business for the UK’s 2,8 billion GBP beauty care sector, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion and home resources are weakening.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets seek to fill in the shelf space previously reserved for television, microwave ovens and home resources.
Sainsbury's describes its beauty care range doubles on 3 000 products, which for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and receive their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket also resets its Boutique makeup selection. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop scent water chain experiments on rent shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to small purchases in nearby stores forces supermarkets to develop new attractions for customers.
I gotsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that shops will look more and more like commodities when the supermarket chain fights against cheap stores such as Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores.
Supermarkett failed in his previous company to renew her beauty care and pharmaceutical departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Bootsin at the beginning of the 21st century, but cooperation ended with a debate on how the output of supermarkets pharmaceuticals should be distributed.
The new strategy will follow the company trade where Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owning the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, with 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of the plan to expand the selection of luxurious skin treatment products in four stores, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
I gotsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We have changed the appearance and the atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also contributed to workers who have received special training, who are willing to advise customers.
Our selection of marks corresponds to all our needs and attractive environments and our convenient locations make us a convincing beauty care shopping site which challenges a traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones's "raged" after Holly Willoughby's 11 million pound agreement.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left with his "rage" when the TV runner Holly Willoughby retired in a 11 million pounds agreement with his lifestyle brand to concentrate on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homemade and homemade labels for Truly.
Two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old manager of this Morning program reported his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den by withdrawing Peter Jones from their profitable lifestyle business in the last few moments.
The sources tell me that Jones was "scared" last Tuesday at a tight tunnel meeting that was held at the head office of Jones's business impression in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that his new 1,5 million GBP contracts would not leave enough time for their homemade and housing marks for Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop product brand, and it was conceived to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
The 37-year-old Willoughby reported to leave Truly in Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left all astonishing power.
No one believed in Tuesday's events so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a stock full of products to be sold."
This Morning drinker is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and according to experts, his departure can result in millions of losses due to product investments, which include all the pillows of candles and clothing on domestic supplies, not to mention delays in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones became chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% share of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is baking a new brand from M&S and is replaced by Ant McPartlin's ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
A hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made a joke about criticism that would be given in the media on his comments that some would find inappropriate to the President, as well as his positive interest in North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a "new anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after the first meeting in July, as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear negotiations have failed.
After a more than three months of the Singapore Summit in July, the North Korean Higher Diploma Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North cannot see a 'comparative reaction' from the United States to the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said that the United States would continue its sanctions to maintain pressure.
The drum had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
According to her efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been terminated, the hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out 10 000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the public directly in front of us.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, Lombok’s aftermath of earthquake told several volunteer organisations abroad that they were not needed.
The national emergency space required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's residents had been homeless.
"In some cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children form a Remunerating Group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
The reporter of the National Catastrophe Agency Sutopo said that Indonesian authorities will assess the situation Please see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the aid work.
Indonesia is still unsatisfactory to face natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes.
Although tsunami shields have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The reward was likely to be lost because of the missing tsunami warning chip, even though the warning was valid.
Travel between numerous islands in Indonesia is challenging even in the best circumstances.
Natural accidents make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the earthquake in Lomboki is on its way to Recovery, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new area of accident.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia at the heart of his electoral campaign, and he has made money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a lack of financial control, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, in which the Muslim majority of the country has adopted the older form of religion, are also exacerbated by pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street fighting on jungle knifes, bow guns, arrows, and other original weapons. This has resulted in more than 1,000 deaths, and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.

Sturrridge received a feed from Xherda Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's painting when his team was at the goal loss station.
He moved the ball to the left before he was terrified of the shooting towards the rear.
The shooting roamed high across the punishment area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play as much as possible upwards, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told the LiverpoolFC.com website.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and I fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the fight in the middle of 1 to 0 in Belgium after the painting of Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues jar in the situation gave Mateo Kovacic the main feed before he fled near the middle field and spurted Liverpool.

Parliament's Cromwell statue was part of history's rewriting paper.
Expelling a statue would be a poetry right, given that his own fanatic puritan holders destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a "typery" and "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a goal of the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't tell you, and he didn't do the iconic lasem of the civil wars in England.
Wrong Cromwell might have to suffer the works of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's marvelous description of Cromwell reflects the opinions of the 18th century and is a historic evidence of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: "Most, although perhaps more in the 18th century than today, Cromwell is the defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, caused the monarchy.
Is this a precise description of the subject, therefore, the subject of an ongoing historic debate?
At least it is certain that, in the middle of the 16th century, the dispute has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must identify the figure representing the other side of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as the governor deserve thanks and remember."
A killer pig smashed a Chinese farmer's death
Local media tells us that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him at the market in Southwest China.
Only the body of a man named "Yuan" was found near Liubanshui market in Guizhou. The man's valley was broken and was on the top of the blood, the South China Morning Post was news on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig shepherd is prepared to vaccinate pigs in pigs in Xining in Qinghai county in China.
He and his cousin traveled from the nearby region of Yunnan were newsed Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him the next morning, and he also noticed that a close silk door was open.
In Sikala, he said he saw a big scream with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, the Criminal Inquiry confirmed a 250-pound cripple from the death of the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News says the cousin Wu said, "My cousin's legs were bloody and ruined."
The surveillance camera shows that a cousin arrives at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders in the market told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind locks so that it would not harm the other cops when they were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and public authorities are reported to be negotiating the compensation for the death.
It is known that pigs have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts State.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig shoved a farmer in Wales against this tractor until his wife managed to get the animal out of the way.
In 2012, after the event, the farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that even though the pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of the blood may be a "first".
"They're just funny.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All we have to do is respect them properly," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring extensive heavy forces to the United States' Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is deteriorating predictably when moving to the north coast of Mexico over cooler waters.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the United States for lunch.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 metres per second, i.e. the first-class hurricane, Sunday, from five o’clock to the east coast, and was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa's expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific Sea, heading east towards the West Coast of the United States. Rosa arrives in California as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to blink deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres rain on Monday to some parts of Mexico.
The tropical humidity then interacting with the approaching low pressure will form large rain areas for lunch in the next few days.
Locally, rains between 25 and 100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rainbows and potentially terrestrial zones in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes 50-75 millimetres of rain in certain landing areas per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in lunch, and especially Arizona, rain is expected to be up to 50 to 100 millimetres.
There is a potential for severe rainfalls, and the conditions can rapidly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
Rain rains can transform the canyons into streams, and the thunderstorms produce local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local harsh spots to coastal vessels in South California.
Rain levels of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste flows and slipping roads.
This would be the first rain in the rain season in the area.
The fragmented tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can be seen with strong flushings in temperatures as the Arctic area cools, but even when the tropic remains quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature fluctuations in short distances.
In the middle of the United States, a fine example of large temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missour and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
The warmth of the summer is once again seeking to grow and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, widely heat is expected in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees within the southern planes from north-eastern.
In New York, the temperature can be pained on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term forecast is that the East of the United States has good opportunities for the average higher temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
On Tuesday, more than 20 million watched the broadcast of six television channels, where Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave an fascinating witness statement.
At the same time, the political patch situation continued to stop broadcasting by television companies on the last moment, according to the fact that the FBI is conducting a weekly investigation of charges on the basis of the agreement concluded by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was defeated and tried to strip off his clothes in the high schools.
On the other hand, Kavanaugh gave a sentimental witness, saying that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
The viewers were likely to have more than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, sent by the opportunity were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who look at offices.
Something about the scales says that the reading corresponds to the number of American football gambling or Oscar gauge viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was on the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's name. On average, the channel had 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
ABC was second to his 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
There was Flake in the middle of the drama on Friday.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protestors' screams led him to a lift on his way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday. The Maltical Republican background forces had previously announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed straight how he stood on a minute store with a look down when he flew.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe him to tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," they said to him."
Mr Flake said that his office had delivered an opinion and added before the elevator doors were closed, that he had more information after consulting the committee.
Hours later, cable and general embassy networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs started to vote on taking Kavanaugh's appointment to the vote of the Senate plenary.
However, Flake said that it was only in the understanding that the FBI would examine the accusations against the candidate in the next week, as the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part of his friend, democratic player Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics of the political force of Brexit
In the interview with the Sunday Times magazine, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticise the EU's differentiation plans for policies that threaten the future of Britain and the national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, a second interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack May's so-called Chequers' plan.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the LSU player's death.
The police have arrested a person suspected in the LSU for the shooting of a 20-year-old Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he's being accused of a second-grade murder.
The authorities published a video about the intercourse between Sims and Simpson, where the police say Sims lost his glasses.

The volcano spits ash above Mexico City
Popocatepetl has reached southern mexico residential areas.
On Saturday, the Mexican catastrophe prevention centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ashes were registered during the day.
The center registers grain and vibrates several times.
In the social media, pictures were published that covered a thin ash layer of car windshields in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano in the southwest of 72 kilometres from the capital after the 7.1 magnified earthquake in Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police and the Catalan Paradigms will meet before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six persons were arrested in the assembly of demonstrators and riot police. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the breakdown vote which shared opinions.
The police arrested the group of masked independence supporters who threw the police with eggs and powder paint, which normally formed dark dust clouds on the streets filled by tourists.
During the day, more buckles broke when the cops used their beams to control the dolls.
The associations between the groups of independence and the Unionists continued for several hours, in the last call "no forget, no forgiveness" and the latter "live Spain".
The local press tells us that 14 people have received treatment for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the ground in an area that supports independence one year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid declares to be illegal, but which is celebrated by the Catalan Paradigms.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was a low difference in the vote on the opposing boikototes.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the violent gatherings of last year when the police tried to prevent voting across the region.
The independent groups stayed outside on Friday in order to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to travel to another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the demonstration of separatists with his wife, said that there was no longer any hope of Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they can vote, but now we are stuck in position," he says.
Despite last December's regional elections, the speed of the parties in favour of the independence of the Catalonia has declined, many of the most well-known leaders are in a voluntary exile or arrest, waiting for the trial to be involved in the referendum and subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who pictured a police demonstration on his phone, says both sides of the politicians arguing the liesoon.
"Your place is getting blackmailed all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalonian leaders in the inquiry from the last nine years, announced their participation in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Becoming a candidate for a European election is the best way to condemn the mourning and repression of democratic values which we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.

Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 at Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first painting in Livingston confirmed victory.
The serialist Livingston astonished the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 matches as the Ibrox Society manager.
Dolly Menga's goal ended up in a victory with Gary Holt's team rising into another place with Hibernian.
Gerrardi's crew was missing the first drainage of the season in Premiership. Next Sunday, it meets the Series Director Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
Rangers will still meet in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipeline in a series of six matches, and Coach Holt has not yet lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost the spots for a visitor with a lack of steel.
The Holt team should have been led long before the goal was caused by some serious trouble with Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and then Alan Lithgow was able to slip through the painting to Craig Halkett's bucket feed, but he passed the ball.
The masters gave the ball control to Rangers with favor because they knew they could vaccinate special situations.
That's exactly the way the main paint came.
Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga, where he was able to move the ball in the middle of the punishment area and finish it.
By then, Rangers had kept the ball, but found that the home team had a defense, and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, hadn't been able to try much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
The Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company, and Lithgow passed the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
Livingston's rainbow was constantly cleaned out, and the two situations were inevitably implied for a penal strike -- the cracked exchanger Glenn Middleton, and a hand-driven ball.
"Fancy performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC in Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron
It's a great performance and the result of Livingston.
The team continued to cross expectations and was excellent with every player, continuing through the rising lines.
The game pattern and crew of the team have not changed much since it has risen back to the highest serial level. However, it must be acknowledged that he has strengthened the team once he has arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredibly well-organised defense when he kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes.
But Rangers didn't have any ideas.
The team has occasionally been very well under Gerrardi, but it is now far from his demand level.
The last feed was exhausted and they managed to open the home team only once, and this should be a wake up for Rangers, which is the middle box of the serial table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne.
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit, which is aimed at correcting NATO alliance relations.
There have been differences between human rights and press freedom and Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population in the city is outside Turkey.
The police prevented a 25 000-headed support team from gathering before the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still a lot of supporters gathered near to see the President.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of them were Kurds - also brought their voices to the members, condemning both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German Government to invite him to the country.
The contested demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the Turkish Germans greet him as a hero in the spirit of others.
Inconsistency in Deptford: A bike driver dies in a collision with a car
The bikeman died when he hit the car in London.
The accident happened at about 10 a.m. on the local time of Deptford's southwest section near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with live traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to help the victim, but a man died at the scene of the event.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a half a mile from the site of Saturday.
The city police say they're trying to identify the man and inform him of his closest.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic on the ground has been steered, and drivers are called to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in trouble
The officers of the prison report six injured men's high-classification in the restoration of the prison.
In the HMP Long Larti Penitentiary, the dissolutions began at Worcestershire at about 09:30 on Sunday, the time of Britain and continues.
The Tornado Special Police have been brought in to calm down the troubles behind which eight prisoners are in one prison wing.
There were few face injuries at the scene of the event.
A reporter in prison said: "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a special-trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken from the police and may have to spend longer behind the bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prison manager was reported to have received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
Furthermore, in October, the riot police were alerted to the prison for serious troubles in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drying areas can benefit)
Arizona rarely arrives with tropical low pressures, but that is exactly what happens next week when the remains of Hurrican Rosa move across the southwest desert with the risk of severe deficiencies.
The national weather service has already alerted the heavy fires during Monday and Tuesday to the southern and east Nevada, southern Caifornia and Utah, and to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it arrives in the form of rain on Monday.
Phoenix’s national weather service pointed out in his tweet that only ten tropical storms have preserved a tropical storm or a low-pressure state at 300 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 km away from the border of Arizona.
The latest modelings of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 millimetres of rain. With the Mogollin brush, Arizona can rain up to 150 millimetres.
In other southwest desert areas, including central rock mountains and Great Basin, there is likely to be 25-50 millilitres.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in the area undergoing droughts if there is no risk of severe rainfalls.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rains can be useful because of the severe drought in the southern lunch.
According to the US Drought Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least the extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says weather.com.
My Hurricane Rosa is on its way first to land in the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and at that time the hurricane is still strong at a wind speed of 135 km per hour, moving north at 20 km an hour.
The storm will lose its power in the face of cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to enter Mexico as a powerful tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rains can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
"California Peninsula, northwest Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimetres and up to 250 millimetres possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues his journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure in Tuesday morning hours, from where it continues its journey through Arizona to the south of Utah by the late Tuesday.
"The greatest risks of Rosa or its remains are associated with extremely heavy rains in the California Peninsula, the northwest Sonor and the United States Southwest Corps", says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening extremities and waste flows in the deserts, as well as land flows in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after the 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital where they say he's in a stable state.
The police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video material recorded on the cell phone about the events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party's "goodness and anger"
"On behalf of Judge Kavanaugh, the vote is against the disgraceful and shameful methods of the democratic party," said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the democratic party's 'goodness and anger' throughout his appointment process.
Mr Kavanaugh proved before the Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford, which would have happened decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also proved his accusations in the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, nature and courage" on that day.
"The vote for confirming the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most respectable legal teachings of our time with excellent seagulls for public service," he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican voting activity in the mid- elections.
"We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's not just a campaign, it's a campaign full," he said.
That's why I'm going around all over to fight for excellent candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had been assigned to "resistance and prevention".
The senior assistant of the Republican Party League told CNN that the first important vote on the Kavanaugh appointment procedure is expected to be held at the Senate no later than Friday.
In Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of dead people are expected to rise.
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 deaths of great earthquake and tsunami to the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, and many were wiped out with the giant waves that struck the beaches.
Please, hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at the festival on the coast of the city, when waves of up to six metres hit the beach in the evening's darkness. Many were rinsed to death when waves destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunamin caused 7.5 magnetic earthquakes.
When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately when they were victims of it," says BNPB reporter Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, Indonesia.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, but it was carrying cars, wooden trunks, houses, and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached the open sea at 800 km an hour before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing into trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Catastrophe Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water-circulating mosque.
The retreats continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes felt in a region where there were 2.4 million people.
In Indonesia, the Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology, BPPT, expressed its opinion that the energy released in the vast earthquake in Friday corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs that were dropped in the second world war in Hiroshima.
It says that the city’s landscape at the end of the long and narrow bay may have sparked tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction of the "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had fallen.
He told us that some victims' bodies were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage may be greater than the Return to the north of 300 kilometres on the continuous coast, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication links "are completely off, and there is no information on Donggala", says Nugroho.
According to the statement made by the Red Cross, over 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling me that the tsunami had attacked Palo, but the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
The man in the top floors of the building in the amateur video distributed in the social media is shouting loudly about warnings for people approaching tsunami on the street.
Only minutes later will the beach be hit by a water wall that takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wide-ranging electric break that cuts communications from around Please. This made it difficult to coordinate the rescue actions of the authorities.
The authorities say that the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities with transport engines, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport of the city has been reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was to visit Please to evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision Donggala's staff has been secured to the city Please, where they have been accommodated in the tent roofs in the office in the interior. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As assisting groups started their uncomfortable assignment, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from traveling to Palota.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to flow when the accident area is declared to be a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the county level," says Aulia Arriani, reporter of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Ok, this is a national disaster," we can start receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the other night landed Please after the earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and family members in the missing were reassured that their loved ones in the miracle store would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Fleet Team, had trained two missing dependents for Asian races that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, says Mandagi.
As a parent member of the Flag, I have my own emotional burden," she says.
Gendon says he has tried desperately to reach those who participated in the beach festival Please competitors with WhatsApp messages after the news about the crash of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the Flag Society.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blues.
"It means I understand that messages were not delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26 750 in connection with the supplement of the banking machine in Newport on the Levee
The thieves took 26,750 dollars from the Brink's security company's staff Friday morning when it was supplementing the banking machine in Newport on the Levee.
The driver had been emptying and supplementing a bank machine in the entertainment centre, Detective Dennis McCarthy, reports in the news.
When Brink's employee's attention was placed elsewhere, "the guy who ran behind him" who stole the bag for delivery.
According to the news, witnesses saw a number of people fleeing from the scene of the event, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons who have information on their identity are invited to contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rabbit will be changed as Ye
The robber Kanye West turns his name as Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote: "The character that was used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a nickname for a 41-year-old West for a while, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change is before his future performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Granden, who, according to the programme creator, canceled his participation for "conscious reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance for him, not only that it is an abbreviation of his professional name.
I'm discussing the name of the album earlier this year with the radio runner Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it means "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began from Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye - which just reveals the goodness in us, evil, confusing, everything.
The album is mainly about who we are."
He's one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is well known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he favoured the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former partner in West JAY-Z has sometimes removed and restored the link and the large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promise not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military forces against civilians.
The Lopez Obrador, who was at the Tlatelolco Plaza, promised on Saturday, "not to use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when the left-hand student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly education support and opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and training opportunities would lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of an artificial intelligence study
The US should double the funding used to study artificial intelligence when China improves its activities. Thus says the donor and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was forwarded by communications on the intelligence of various parts of the US administration, although the United States lacked a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China already presented its plan last year: it aims to develop a leading artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Twisting the budget of the industrial intelligence research would be a good start when we consider that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of the artificial intelligence," says Lee.
The double-checking of funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence aid would be made in the United States, Lee reported this week in the CNBC interview.
Lee's book "Intelligent Powers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, which has invested in the largest industrial intelligence company in China called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest Othello player in the United States.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to identify future visionaries.
Lee says the US scientists worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic agents don't take China, they're taking big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited universities in recent years to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their intelligence efforts.
"I think that you should automatically grant green cards to those performing an artificial intelligence doctorate," she said.
The Chinese Government's next generation of intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funding to persons working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other State organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was set up by the United States Department of Defense, which aims to bring together the partners of the world of industry and academics, and the White House has also announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA has also announced this month the investment of $2 billion on the AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests more than EUR 100 million per year in an artificial intelligence study.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up a National Security Commission on Intelligence has not evolved in months.
The Macedonians in the referendum amending the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday's referendum on the amendment of the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. The change would solve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
According to Greece, the name of the Northern Neighbourhood is practically a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to EU and NATO membership.
In June, the governments concluded an agreement on a new nomination proposal, but the nationalists believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that it is not going to vote in the referendum and the campaign against the vote raises doubts about whether the level of voting activity is achieved by the required 50% limit to ensure that the result is legal.
The question in the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reasonably argue that the price should be paid so that Macedonia could become a member of both the EU and NATO as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote in favour of the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia to live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, sufficiently many Members have said that they have respected the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The change in the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Board, no irregularities were reported by 13 a.m.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, at the end of which 66% of voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on the change in name in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and set chairs for a referendum in front of the tents set up by the boikotoes, in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We are using NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up and not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia as part of the euro-related integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring explosive investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"In favour of a name-change voted by a large majority of faith, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev, after having voted.
He said "yes" is "deficient to our future."
The question of opinion published by my Macedonian political research institute on Monday referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum, i.e. under the required activity.
In the second survey by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they voted in favour of a yes option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, the voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious retaliation of the Western government after it came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero in Manchester City defeated the entire Brighton defence.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear that Brighton was defended in the 2-0 win of Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the paint that he made over 65 minutes seem ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player received an intake from the center of the field.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton protectors.
Then Aguero found four green shirts surrounded.
He pushed over one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's penal zone.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used his first touch within the punishment area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard to the right corner of Mathew Ryan's goal.
The manager of City Pep Guardiola told the journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We said he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a goal in that time."
However, Sterling had already benefited the sky blues in the election campaign.
The painting came with 29 game minutes.
Aguero got the ball in the deep Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful passport on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before he sent the ball to the back of Sterling.
The sky blue attacker pushed the ball into the net just before the end limit.

Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a fight against Rockies.
Nationals is out of the playoff, so why are you forced to go to the opening meeting?
But always one competitive Scherzer hopes to take over the feed gum at the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a drop game, they have one victory in the Los Angeles Dodgers West series.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still targeting their first division win.
"Although we don't have a stake, we can at least get up to the nutrient, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the second team in Denver creates the most demanding competitive situation for me this year.
Why would I not want to face the challenge?"
Nationals has not yet published its starter for Sunday, but according to information, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a rehearsal on Thursday, he'd play his 34 at the beginning of his game, and he'd feed him on his normal rest shift on Sunday.
The right-hand player in Washington has a 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he's burned the hitter to the nest 300 times, with the exchange statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in Western Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his candidate for Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the Republican voting activity in the mid- elections.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the very great -- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I'm all around to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You will see this terrible, terrible, radical group of democrats, you will see it happening now.
They've decided to return to the horror of power by any means, and you can see their nastyness and evilness.
They will not choose who will be harmed or who shall be steered, so that they may get to power. That is what they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the Democrats took the task of "resistance and prevention".
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats, "hate and evil, and evil, and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein as the prolonged democratic player of the Senate Judicial Committee, the public responded with loud bulls.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you run the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I expect a little -- it was really bad from the body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It will not tolerate those who say their opinions
I wasn't really surprised when my local Momentum activists supported the clause of confidence against me.
Well, at least I'm only the last member of a line of work to be told that I'm not welcome just because we say our opinions.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was strongly opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, the clause of confidence was criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, are quite ironically similar to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference stated on Friday that "we want our meetings to be involved and productive".
Most of the eight years I have been a local representative of the Labour Council have been the same.
Now, many of the meetings do not follow that tone, and the "friendly and gentler" policy has long ago been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerate divergent opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is appropriate for the party's leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to have a full translation and statements that I would never have agreed to, by the way, whether national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result of the insults in the social media, which requires my choice to be canceled, the rejection of central policy, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I do know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are, at least, political.
I deeply respect the professionality and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults daily and never deteriorate.
The normalisation of caltoid treatment is one of the most disturbing features of this age policy.
Last week, Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every clause of confidence or change in the rule of choice, the party will become more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "all things are going well."
But that's not why I left politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failures of the Government of Thatcher to a single school, I have tried to promote better public services for those who most need.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been able to surprise my perspectives or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the State moves towards a brexit that affects households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honour, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable in Ayr block section
Two last-minute paintings slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr unquestionably earned the victory in the Tennent's Premiership game.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that hasn't lost any fights.
Excellent defence and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie could be pleased for the reason.
"We've been challenged in our fights and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." He says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All the honors for Ayri, they took more risks than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes on Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversio kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, who gave the warriors' match, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot made the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the punishment painting, and just before half-time, he made a goal and succeeded in a conversio kick, raising Ayri's leadership to read 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well at Patrick Anderson's goal, which in the conversion kick Baggot succeeded in narrowing the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the fight when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and picked out of the field. When the game continued, Ayr raised his leadership at Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayri's Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard-pressure paint that was not successful in the conversion.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tacking the ballless Clio, and Macpherson made a goal from the bottom of Ayri's maul from the sideline.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and tweaked Gregor Henry to finish his home team's fifth goal.

The still Game star Ford Kieran has been appointed the director of the licensed restaurant company and is thus also starting work in the restaurant sector.
A 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program he's writing with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The twin has announced that the next ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he has been designated as director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted Glasgow to live in a prosperous restaurant business.
"Meri belongs to us": the inland Bolivia tries to get back contact with the Pacific Ocean by law
Marines are patroling outside the Navy base in La Paz.
In the flags of public buildings, the sea-blue flag is floating.
The shipping bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been sloganed: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of Chile in the coastline lost in the bloody 1800s is still strong – as well as the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
The hope will be at the top of the decades when Bolivia is waiting for the International Court to decide on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, co-spirit and innerity, and, of course, a positive attitude in the waiting for the final solution," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of Bolivians all over the country will follow the International Court of Justice's decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of the end of the decades of the debate – Bolivia's view that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia's independent access to the sea.
The Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, who meets the re-election of the battle that was debated next year, is a lot in the game next Monday's direction.
"The return to the Pacific is very close," he convinced the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it decides, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-family UN institution has no competence to dispose of the administrative areas of Chile, and ICJ has also announced that it does not prescribe the future of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is to be taken only six months after the last statements indicates that the case 'is not complex', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international legislation.
Furthermore, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted the purpose of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian regime has taken the question of the maritime connection," said Zárate.
The retorics that challenged Morales have suppressed the rest of the chilean goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
In either country, there has been no second embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in Haagi, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the Court’s decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia a "official opportunity to start a new age in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop disagreements for 139 years with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also argues that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to contact the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that no nuclear disarmament would occur unless it could be trusted in the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is reintroducing deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that it is a "second dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to their knees.
Before Pjongjang first took important measures to promote disarmament, Washington will be alert to the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be about to give up the ace-earsenal, which the State is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has received a widespread doubt.
Pompeo is about to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows the most recent model of large-scale heads, which will be on your next street as well
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 screening a variety of special superfamous mains that would jeopardize the style circles of the Paris fashion weeks.
Instagram was taken over by very unpractical heads this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creation to fashion shows as well.
Valentino's most impressive creature was a beige hat with a wide feather, almost completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized costumes were, among other things, jewellery-decorated aquatic melon, sorcerer, and even ananas — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a variety of unique masks – just before Halloween.
In many colorful masks, lips were sewn, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than the top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and mask reminded more of the diving device, and the other reminded me of the melted ice cream.
And if you want to take a position for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The successors of the fashion predict that huge scarves are about to appear in the streets.
The over-size hats follow strictly "La Bomba", a half-million liquor straw hat, seen from Rihana to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the cult of a largely unpractical hat also twisted another large creature into fashion shows – a sleeve beach bag that is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The burnt orange decorated raffi suite with white leather belts had the most impressive creation of the Jacquemus' La Rivieran SS19 model in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large-scale hats and beach suits in the street picture next summer – designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale dwellings."
John Edward: Language skills is a key skill for the world citizen
The results of the studies of private schools in Scotland have been traditionally good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good experimental results. The success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30 000 students, represented by the SCIS, are located across Scotland, seeking to provide a high level of service for their pupils and students' parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for the career they choose, for further education, for higher education and for the world citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement tailored learning content, we have seen the role of languages as a popular and hoped learning material in continuing education institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create relations with people in other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade in A.
The data were collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the material, students who received the best grade A, 72% studied mandarin quin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages are currently free-minded substances, but they are considered to be the same as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering sciences and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding an appropriate employee was explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of linguistic skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the career development of young people in the future.
The more possible work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills are formed in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skills, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with the foreigner to automatically put a language-skilled person ahead of the competition.
According to the YouGov survey in 2013, 75 per cent of more than 4 000 Isobritannian adults are unable to engage in a foreign language, and France was the only language with a two-digit figure of 15 per cent.
To this end, it is important for the children now to be involved in the teaching of languages.
Knowledge of languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
In Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some are literally teaching languages that are supposed to be important for the Isobritannian people in 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always a number of language options taught by specialist teachers at private schools.
Scotland’s private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with skills that are needed to succeed in the future.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today's languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of youth in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the SCIS Board of Private Schools in Scotland
LeBron's making a debuty on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the supporters waiting for LeBron James in the Los Angeles Lakers lines is almost over.
Coach of Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James plays against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, he'll be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Mike Trudell, the reporter of the Lakers, tweeted that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games to be played by Lakers before it was.
"This is the stage of my career, I don't need any more pre-game games to prepare for" he said.
Time of the Trumpin Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns in Wheeling in West Virginia today.
It's Trump's first election event for next five weeks, including sympathetic objects, such as Tennes and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his choice to complete the free place of the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for the forthcoming intermediate elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in the Congress in November elections.
At what time is the Trumpin Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trumpin West Virginia Wheeling begins at 19 east coasts on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can watch Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a pettrimation through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump should be able to refer to the hearing of the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who became intensive about sexual harassment accusations, which have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote weekly during the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective for the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the strict November elections.
Consequently, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of the five events of the next week's event, "to raise voluntary and viable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Government of the Congress is so important for his purposes that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the urgent campaign period," said Reuters the anonymous representative of the Trump campaign.
Today's event place is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and even "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" can arrive in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to the last month in West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent units in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican Senatorial candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind in the opinion measurements.
"For Morrisey's sake, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support in opinion measurements," said state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the desire to fight to maintain hope before Sunday alone games
After three unilateral sessions Saturday afternoon's four-game were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the strength that strengthens success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players believe it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force, according to them at the moment?
"They had a six-point leading position, which narrowed to four, so we take this success force as a twist," said Jordan Spieth when he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points above and 12 can be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and much to encourage, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, who helped them play together all day and got three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the road to the green, and leads with the example.
The winning party’s handful throat sounds increased as he progressed when he succeeded in a critical tube to equalize the match to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The Puttia that they won the 15th match followed a similar scream that gave us the idea that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have gained more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, are Ryder Cupin's undeniable legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the lovely twin has won four out of four incompletely.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who did no bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way they give and receive energy from this sloppy audience, confirms that they are Sunday's preliminaries. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, another more popular player for ensuring Europe's potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd prefer both at the same time with different holes.
However, the speeches about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was a hero of the four-game game this morning.
On the first nine holes, one bogi and two duplabogi dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into a hole that they were not even near to survive there.
On Sunday, though, no one's coming to help you out of the hole.
Four balls and a four-game are fascinating to follow close from a couple's cooperation perspective: What advice they give or fail to give and how the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the United States team has a desire to fight, even though it has been suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe takes 10-6 leadership before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 leads from the United States on Saturday in four balls and four games.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a winning trip to two winners of Tiger Woods, and scored to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain the victory that Hazeltine lost two years ago, controlled the poorly played U.S. team in the morning's four-ball, taking the situation 3-1.
The United States was a harder opponent in four games winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points from Sunday 12:00 in order to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood" together, were the second twin in Ryder Cup's history, which has won four points in the first four games.
After smashing in four balls Woods and Patrick Reed, they then ended up with more than 4 more forces in Bryson Dechambeau, the overwhelming Woods and the US beginner.
Woods, who barely survived through two Saturday matches, was occasionally very great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four-game, and even seven consecutively.
Justin Rose rested the four balls this morning, but she and Henrik Stenson returned to the four-game, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks to Koepka, the first and third ranking.
Europe did not receive everything in its desire this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The triumphant winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the Americans at two points on Saturday.
They earned a dreadful 2-1 victory in the four balls of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Spain, and then 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four-game after the first two holes were lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from a four-point drive station to levels at the start of two-games, even though Furyk's side is also enough to keep the victory.
However, after two days of being the second best, there may be too many requests for an attack on Sunday.
North Korea "not in any way" takes off its weapons without trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
During the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill" during the last year, as it has stopped nuclear and missile tests, has dismantled the site of nuclear experiments and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to separate ourselves from our weapons unilaterally."
However, even though Ri reiterates the fact that Washington does not accept a step-by-step withdrawal of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for each matter, his opinion is important in the sense that unilateral disarmament is not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has previously done.
Ri referred to the joint opinion by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US President and North Korea leader summit in Singapore on 12.6. in the statement, Kim convincing "the deflection of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has officially tried to decide the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjangi should first dispose of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States demands "material stripping first", and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their targets by force – even opposing "the declaration of peace"," Ri said.
"A maneuvering that sanctions would get us on our knees is an indifferent hope.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our confidence in the lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed earlier to the UN this week.
On the other hand, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party demanding to disarmament would be South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have gone to such a dead end."
However, Rin's tone was considerably different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States' continental regions was inevitable after "bad President" Trump called Kim as a missile man with suicide intentions.
Still last year Trump threatened to "destruct completely" in North Korea. This year Trump, however, praised Kim with this boldness to approach the firearms, but still stressed that the work remains much and the sanctions must remain until North Korea ceases nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he did not have a time limit: "If it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward the progress made by Pjongjang.
However, on Thursday, the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council: "The strengthening of the Sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we prove to be completely, ultimately and strengthened."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions for North Korea since 2006 with the aim of dismantling the financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pjongjang.
Pompeo met North Korea in the context of the UN General Assembly of Rin and also announced that he would visit Pjongjang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pjongjang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like requirements" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and nuclear installation at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in case the United States takes "the corresponding measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "equivalent measures" security guarantees to which Trump committed to the meeting of Singapore, and to move towards the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students conduct an adequate resting course
All students at Harvard University will attend this year’s course with the aim of increasing the rest of students. The course is an anticipation for a machoculture that flourishes at the University, where students weigh a long night with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often very ignorant in the basic issues of their own wellbeing.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty, who works in a sleeping study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after his lecture on the effect of a sleep deficiencies on learning.
"After my lecture, a young woman came to me, saying, "Why can I hear about it only now, in my last year of study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising," he told me in the interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year’s course guides students on how true unitations support academic and sports performance and improve public well-being.
Professor of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty and Vice-Chairman of Health Services at the University, Paul Barreira says that the university ended up in the course after hearing how students suffered from serious sleep deficiencies during the study week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will be given a picture of the apartment room where the student can click coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thereby obtaining information about the effects of caffeine and light and the effect of sleep deficiency on sports activities and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these matters in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night-long study marathons are still a matter of pride, and the increasing pressures of modern technology and students made the problem of sleep shortages.
"An adequate and high-quality sleep should be against the stress, exhaustion and anxiety of the students, and even against the increase of weight, because the lack of sleep causes a state like starving in the brain, which is why the person is constantly hungry," says the professor.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old, Californian student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he had participated in one of his teaching courses for the first year in Harvard last year.
He tells us that the course opened his eyes and gave an impulse to organise a course for all campus students.
He hopes that all postgraduate students could carry out a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students be reminded of the alarming clock as well as the morning awakening of the bedtime, and urges them to bear in mind the adverse reactions caused by the electronic display equipment and the light of the LED light to the 24-hour rhythm, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shooting took victory from Gerrad's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced a new day of loss when Dolly Menga's shooting broke through the defence brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox's players were going to get their first win after the 4-1 game of February, which went against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took victory this time, and Gerrard now suffered his second loss during his 18-game manager's career. Rangers remained eight points away from the current leader Hearts.
Menga fired the ball on the goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the warfare of the Rangers was no longer tailored.
As a result of the game, Rangers fell to the sixth place. Instead, Livingston has climbed to the third place, and only Hibernia is above the goal gap.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when he hit the object that was thrown out of the guest view, and the wound had to be handled.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the team that had hit Ayri and advanced to the Scotland's leap semifinals.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 meeting, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy returned again when a well-built assembly managed to discipline the opponent almost every turn.
While Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the paint over two minutes, when the first feed of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the second defender, Alan Lithgow, was able to take a long shot in the back.
On the other hand, Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the game was no longer self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos called for punishment when he and Steven Lawless met each other at fifteen minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, refused to bother Lassana Coulibaly's bag and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s paint at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team’s hard work.
Rangers couldn't still do anything to Jacobs' long-standing activists.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who got a cold-headed ball on Menga for easy paint.
During the changeover, Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field, and the switch almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos, but the attack broke Kelly's impressive rapid defence.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to increase its leadership at the last moment of the game. However, McGregor's fine defence prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow reached its positions.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the exchange of the Rangers, also called for punishment after taking Jacobs together, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Next page of our Sunday Morning apple: 30 September 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of the device known as the geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science and also the key concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches" published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play scientists that seem to be very cattle shepherds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gay gay meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the impact of radioactive radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really solved!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
The invention that bears his name still lives.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to see malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to see malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to “see” proteins typical for several cancers
The test has provided promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months of treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method is to isolate resistant cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical for several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "In our findings it is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "guides the growth of several types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and cancer of ovaries, lungs and colons."
Similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was caught in critics' teeth after praising the Trumpia Saturday Night Live campaign hat in his head.
The presentation did not go as planned
Kanye West received bouquets in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after praised President Donald Trum and announced to be president in the 2020 elections.
After presenting its third song of "Ghost Town" Trumpin Make America Great Again, the campaign resulted in the attack on the democrats in West and repeated its support for President Trump.
"I used to talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trum because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
This evening's broadcast began on a schematic where Matt Damon gave the impression to consult Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate's Legal Committee, which relates to the arguments made by Christine Blasey Ford on the sexual harassment of Kavanaugh.
West's fasting was not presented in a direct broadcast, but the comic Chris Rock downloaded it into the social media.
I don't know if it's Rock's intention to make fun of West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had fallen to be treated for the hat he had in his head.
"I was struggled behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't be on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been embarrassed!
And then they say that I'm in the margin," says West at the Washington Examiner interview.
West continues: "Do you want to see what the margin means?" and says that he's wearing Superman's note because "you can't tell me what I'm doing." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to the varied, the comments made by West were struck by the audience at least twice, and the performers of the show seemed embarrassed. One of the people present described the situation in the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected for a short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusing in many viewers by making the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the head of the Conservative TPUSA organization, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: "KING DON'T THINK ROSKAVEN".
But the leader of the conversation program, Karen Hunter, said that West "is just himself, which is once-to-all wonderful".
"I can, however, decide that a person who is in need of help (by buying this music or a costume mark or by supporting this "art"), which I consider to be supporting and disseminating the ideaology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Before tonight's show on Twitter, the spider reported that he changed his name as "a person who was previously known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course, we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol and later as an artist known as Prince.

The actor star of the Great Championship Kit Harington attacks poisonous masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his heroic role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series of HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked Machosankar's stereotype: a 31 - year - old actress says that such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In the interview with the Sunday Times Cultural Association, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the means in place to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who was recently married to the Stargate of the Valley Championship, also married to the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity raises strong feelings in me at the moment," she says.
"What have men been taught to grow in years that have led to problems that are now perceived?"
Harrington believes that television and very maskulinous figures are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, "What's inborn and what's learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
'Cause young men have something really wrong."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the front or forward parts of the Valley Championship after the series ends next summer, because he has had enough of the battlefields and horses according to his own words.
In November, Harrington will be seen in the new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells us about the film producer and the kidnapper brother.
Recently, the actress revealed that the best way to get to know his future Rose wife was to offer him the Power Championship game.
"I met my wife at this show, so, in a way, it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love, the Harrington act in an Emmy-judgment fantasy show.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's premises in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections has increased 14% in China
China has announced that its citizens with HIV positive and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have only been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which means a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan Conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to nearly zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected in China has risen in 100 000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination between LGBTs has been reported to be common.
The studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many infections are due to inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee the general availability of HIV medicines as part of the action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denys the information of an employee's leaked Republicic sensor and accuses of spreading dangerous lies and secret alliance theories.
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued that his employees would have published personal information on three republicators on their Wikipedia websites.
The Democrat representative from Los Angeles assured us that the distributors of the claims are "extremists" commentators and websites.
"White, lying and more despicable lies," says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and of the Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the state of Utah.
An unknown person published the information on the United States Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee. The hearing was on the charges of sexual abuse against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
A little after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that according to the Hillin newspaper, messages were published on the IP address attached to the Waters Office and by the person belonging to the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it's an absolute lie", Water continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and sincere accusations, has no responsibility for the leakage of these data.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by the former press secretary Ari Fleischer of the White House.
"The way he denys this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his nature is not suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he has no reason to act hostilely.
There's no reason to be ruthless.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave moderately and calmly."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes at Waters' place in the Congress's mid-select, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he was on the TV.
Waters announced in his opinion that he contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these false accusations.
"We ensure that the authors are revealed," he continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all the disastrous and dangerous actions against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English hits again – low-efficient Rowan Atkinson Agent Barody
The tradition has already been established to look for brexit references from any film on the British side. However, this does not appear to be appropriate for Johnny English agent industry and the operational comedy series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in the 2011 extension part of "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the language of the nation's satire in the cheek become a new national export success in Britain?
Yes, or so, Johnny English, a prick-eyed, incompetent and incompetent, has earned his permission to reproduce, and his name tells us, first and foremost, that it is a comic creation that is directed to the non-English film markets.
It is, of course, a secret agent who is desperately trying to breathe the melting glamour, but appears in a blend of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unhappy one musician in London's 2012 opening concert.
On the basis of the figure, the cosmopolite and the mysterious worldman that Atkinson originally presented in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements.
Well, the last show, yes, has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and his helmet is knocked off by the roottor's stages.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts can come out, but humor itself seems under-effective and strangely unnecessary, especially because the 'strong' film brands, such as 007 and the Dangerous task, are now offering humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor seems to be a big deal for children, and Johnny English's crazy treatment does not seem to me as inventive and sharp as Mr. Atkinson's Mr. Bean's silly role comedy.
Once a year's recurrence is the fact that Britain is in a worse situation.
The Cyber Hacker is infiltrated into the British top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents on the field as a knockout of an agent on the service – which is presented as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunate little role.
This is the last drop to the prime minister in importance and pinch, who is already in the ears of political discomfort: Emma Thompson will do everything in the skins of the Teresa May parodiahmo, but the manuscript will not just offer him enough space.
When advisers of the Intelligence Service tell him that all spy on the field have been revealed, a person who has already displaced from active service must be called into distress.
This is, of course, a stunning Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a finest school teacher, but at the same time gives unofficial lessons in the knowledge of spying. The subject cheers some clever jokes; English keeps school of Rock-type lessons in the intelligence halls.
English is congratulated for the emergency meeting in Whitehalli, where he meets again with his infinitely patient partner, Bough, who is still being played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty’s secret service to meet the fateful supercrime Ophelia Bhuletova, Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is about to become a maneuvered by a charismatic IT billionaire, and the Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the computer problems in Britain.
English and Bough's odyssei is now transformed into a farce: the masked twin will light a fine French restaurant on fire and cause chaos while secretly seeking Volta's luxury yacht. The company to become an exa house with virtual glasses ends in a clean anarchy in the real world.
Even the last obstacles of the authors will go to the final scene, but despite all the invincible and charm, the film still seems to be a little made to the general child.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching films, Johnny English, I've been thinking about the same thing before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would give him the right to his talent?
The British Labour Party denys the plans for a four-day working week at five-day salary
The work run by Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of an extra holiday.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy three-day weekends at the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of a “compatible” party's economic programme and its plans to cost the policy for the benefit of workers.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of benefiting workers from the changing economic situation.
The source of a high-level working party tells the Sunday Times newspaper: "The revision of the line has been reported before the change of the year.
The change does not take place in a moment, but the four-day working week is the objective that fits the party's approach to balance the economy for workers and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first person to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to support the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective cannot be shared in the labour lines.
The reporter of the Labour Party states: "The four-day working week is not the line of the party, and the party is not considering the transition."
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, took advantage of presenting its vision of the economic revolution of the work conference last week.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "ungrown dictators" and from "scientists of general interest companies".
According to the plans of the Minister for Finance of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their share as a whole because the government led by the Labour could implement 'reductions' on the basis of the abuses found.
He also confirmed the plans to put workers in the management of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees, and to the plan would be to pay up to 500 GBP per year to the individual employee in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing the 60-minute program whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh's inquiry on charges has delayed at least weekly the final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some republicators for the appointment of Kavanaugh.
During the 60-minute program on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Senators of the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it would be possible that the FBI would find out things that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolin colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, when the accusations came out, and I asked him, ‘Do you do it? ’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, instead, looks like the stone is beaten.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb-proof thing," she said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly disputed it," Graham added Christine Blasey to Ford.
"No one named him was able to confirm it.
It's about 36 years old.
I can't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York, is a music event with the performer's card as impressive as its mission: the eradication of poverty from the world.
It is now seven times the Global Citizen Festival that attracts tens of thousands of people in New York Central Park to listen to performers, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real objective of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, continues to be a Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively active in addressing poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (whoever is not willing to pay the VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "works" such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or perform any other act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has the Global Citizen succeeded now that there are only 12 years to achieve the objective?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket rewarding a real way of persuading people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others — the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a TV?
Global Citizens report that they have recorded more than 19 million "development" on behalf of the different objectives since 2011.
According to this act, political decision-makers have been encouraged to report commitments and principles corresponding to more than USD 37 billion, and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion have already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected the lives of almost 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom who has committed to "to help children develop their full potential". The group committed to delivering $35 million in Rwanda to terminate the sub-treatment in the country. This was since the activists had sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the British Government, the donors, the governments of different countries, and just like you, the universe citizens, we can transfer social injustice and subtle nutrition to the history journals," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, to the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 acts, and the Government has published a programme of 5 million mothers and children to combat under-treatment.
One of the questions asked on the web site is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The global citizen's answer is, "He's going to be long and difficult, and there's a lot of controversy stones ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, like the major civil rights fights and the movements against apartheid before us, because we are stronger together."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running the New York Concert this year, and its Stargate includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the US Ministry of Interior, the country can make it difficult to export energy by using the Navy as a "premise"
According to the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner magazine, Washington may use its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the near future.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria — the call of the legal government — are an excuse for the recognition of the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the [Russia] reason for the presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe," says Zinken.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States have the ability to keep the routes open through their fleet and, if necessary, by reaching to ensure that the energy they provide does not end on the world market," she says.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, which is a non-profit group that is profiled as the "Energy Consumers Sound" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel by another", he says, and describes Russia as a "a circus number" based on fossil fuels.
These opinions are due to a situation where Trump’s administration has sought to improve the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace significantly cheaper Russian liquid gas.
In order to improve this, Trump’s administration, including President Trump, will try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "uncompliant" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds to the Moscow rehabilitation youth in Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of existing pipelines, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition has purely economic causes, and it is considered as an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," says the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak, after meeting the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's attitude has led to a response in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial roofing organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel very problematic about the third country being involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industrial Union, recently after the meeting of the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to carefully consider the position of the presidential elections in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren, from Massachusetts, announced on Saturday that he would "be careful" to be a candidate for president after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate at an open survey in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct our faulty government, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said according to the Hill magazine.
After the sixth day of November, I intend to consider carefully about setting up a candidate for President.
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the event saying, "He's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared as a direct criticism of Mr Trum and of the candidates of this Supreme Court, Mr Kavanaugh.
Warren wrote in the Twentieth published on Friday, "I guess we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, according to the question of opinion published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s electorates do not support this condition in 2020.
According to the study carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the candidate's position.
32% were in favour of candidates.
A number of respondents supported the initial Governor Deval Patrick's position at 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other nominated candidates for democracy in the 2020 elections are, for example, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has said that Biden has officially decided on his candidate by January.
Sarah Palin refers to his son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Pal, 26, spent the year in Iraq after recruiting the armed forces in September.
Track Pali was arrested on Monday's night, and he was prosecuted of domestic violence.
"What my own son has to go through after returning home I can well identify with other families who face the consequences and injuries of the PTSD that our soldiers are returning home," he told the audience in Tulsa, in Oklahoma, at the Donald Trump election conference.
Palin called the arrest "flower horse in the living room" and said his son, as well as the other war veterans, "come home a little moved, they come back hardened, they return to wonder whether they respect what he and his companions have done in the army and in the air forces for this country."
Track Pali was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to the Wasilla Police reporter, Dan Bennett, he was charged with the rape of the family, the assault of the woman, and the rape of the family and the handling of the weapon.
18 States and the Columbia Alliance support the action against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia Alliance are calling for a change in the new direction in force in the United States, which states that asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or family violence.
18 state and federal representatives have left a letter of justice to friends on Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who break the line, reports NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal direction in August.
He says that his partner, "and his sons of his violent gang", was assaulted by the U.S. authorities, he was denied asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are of the United States' asylum seekers, as states where gang and family violence are a problem spreading across all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the decision of the Board of Appeal for Asylum applications in 2014 that paperless immigrants may have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the Columbian Federal Prosecutor, commented on Friday's opinion that the new line "to ignore the state, federal and international law for decades".
"The law of the Union requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this obstacle is infringed by the Friends of the Law of the Law."
The prosecutors also argue in the letter that access to asylum seekers is preventing practice from harming the US economy, as they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "produce the necessary additional labour force".
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges to suspend asylum from victims of family violence and gang violence.
"Security is intended for persons who are fleeing from their country because of persecution or fear caused by their race, religion, nationality or a certain class of society" Sessions announced the new asylum policy in its opinion of 11.6.
The asylum was never intended to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day in the world.
Unwanted Surviving Actions Continue in Return — Number of Death Victims found has already doubled
The situation in the survivors is becoming more serious.
"Your house is very tense," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming down her hot baby in an evacuation centre in the ruined city.
"Ambulances bring new bodies from minutes.
The clean water is low."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is yet to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 hospitals damaged in the magnetic earthquake are filled.
Some of the injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Army Hospital, where patients are treated for continuous, powerful afterquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears in his narrative of how rageful earthquake shaked a fifth floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Harris says, according to Associated Press, and tells me that he was in the city of his family as a wedding guest.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "provocation" by "propaganda reports"
The U.S. Ambassador of China accuses Beijing of using the American magazine as a propaganda instrument, which will take place a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement on the US-China trade agreement.
The United States President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the paid list of the Chinese Daily magazine in the Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, accused of congress elections in China on 6 November.
According to the U.S. authorities who spoke to Reuters, the trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere with the US elections represent a new step in the expansion campaign in Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal that the foreign government is disseminating notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently always stuck in the escalating trade war, where both parties, on their turn, impose customs duties on the export products of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, the Chinese vengeanceriffs were targeted at the beginning of the trade war for states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the United States Ambassador of China and the long-term Governor of Iowa says that Beijing has damaged the United States' workforce, farmers and businesses.
China "is now exacerbating its provocations by further publishing propaganda declarations in our own free press" wrote Branstad in her opinion writing at the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"With reconciling its propaganda, the Chinese Government will benefit from the United States' respected freedom of expression and the traditions of the press by setting up a paid declaration in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"In contrast, the different opinions of the peking streets are only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can not see from the alarming development of their economy; this is because the media is strictly in the Chinese Communist Party's backing youth," he writes.
Branstad continues to say that "one of the largest newspapers in China has prevented the offer from being published", the article he wrote, but does not specify what magazine it is about.
The Kavanaugh Fiasko will expel women from the Republicans, the analysts will warn you.
The fact that many of the tips of the Republicans stand behind the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and defend him, can lead to a response, according to analysts, in particular in the future mid-elections with female voters.
The emotions surrounding the case have been on the big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed to the vote.
"These things cannot be canceled," says Professor Grant Reeher from the Maxwell Institute of the University of Syracuse in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republikans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer for the FBI investigation to rest on angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November", says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the press reporter of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang "November coming" in demonstrating the views of the Republicans in the Senate presiding on the Republicans of the judiciary in order to proceed to Kavanaugh's appointment, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be appraisalable", says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst on the news site interview.
"People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, in particular, with the insecure female voters in the neighbourhood and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not often vote because they do not like the president."
The analysts anticipate a possible response if the Republicans proceed with confirmation before the Ford's statement of evidence against the candidate of the Supreme Court in which they claimed sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a confusion to the Republican party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"The question is not only about the vote or the final vote of the Committee or whether Kavanaugh is to be questioned; it is about how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Fordia", Guy Cecil, the Head of the Priorities of the United States for Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe the statement of witnesses by Ford or Kavanaugh when a short majority tends to the latter.
According to the new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford’s witnesses are absolutely or likely, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or absolutely lied in his witness statement, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake invaded, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one of the other accusations of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
In front of the judiciary, Ford prosecuted Kavanaugh to harass him in drunkenness when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court has revealed him at his family's student party when they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a new Internet counter to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, has launched a start-up company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source code of Berners-Lee on the Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
At the Fast Company interview, Berners-Lee jokes about the "government of the world" of Inrupt.
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up attempt.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data storage", POD.
It may contain lists of contact information, lists of memory, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available at the same time.
In the personal data warehouse, it is unique that it is fully attached to the user who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "to be personalized through information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises a safety platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Brucen, IBM, some employed developers working with the project, as well as a community consisting of voluntary codifiers.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team do not discuss "with the facebook and Google whether people should be able to make a perfect change, where all their business models are turned to their heads in one night".
"We're not asking for their consent."
In the article published in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the new Solid network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee evoked the Internet by setting up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic for the next season of the network, looking at it," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only clergy rewarded by the Victoria Cross Medal of the Church of England, a priest who was a soldier, after the events have passed 100 years.
The bravery medal was awarded to the Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, on 29 September 1918, following the attacks of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt villages.
But Vann died four days later, without ever getting to know of the highest British army.
Two of his grandchildren were exposing a monument stone in Rushden, a parade at Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "improvely symbolic"; the memorial was revealed equally for 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's tears.
According to London Gazette, 29th, 1918 Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later, he struck into the front line and, with the "greatest bravery", led to the advancement of the troops before his attack on the single field forces. In the following battle, Vann culminated with his own hands three armored pattern soldiers.
Colonel Vann died of a German sniper on 4 October 18 — only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that raises respect."
Michael Vann He counted his brother Dr. James Vann in a fight after the orchestra of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's a great honour to participate in the parade and added: "The great crowd of people is remembering the honor of a true hero."
Friends of the free match waited up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation in which you've been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
The San Jose event was scheduled for 13 matches, six main series matches, and the show was to be presented as a direct broadcast on Channel 5 in Britain.
At 6:00 in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program turned into the great shock of the Pipsa Possuu viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch over the whole night because of the match.
A friend of the free match opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match by the children's drawing as a "some kind of sick joke".
According to the law, this content was not appropriate for presentation at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change it to the programme", explained Dave Schwartz, the Deputy Director for marketing and communication of Bellator's parents.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
The director of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said that the schedules will be worked so that the British viewers can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a re-election that probably makes the program work," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning, and we can't have the program presented until Sunday in our time, which is Mondays in their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to move in the direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a matter of law.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and tried too much.
This is a troubled situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt underrated because of his sexuality.
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he felt underrated over all other people because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he only noticed when he came to upper secondary school that "all are not like me."
Mr. Lauren Laverne, speaking in the Radio 4 Channel Desert Island Discs, says Daley that he spoke about the rights of gay people to give others hope.
He also tells us how it was no longer so important to win the Olympics after having a child.
Kristy Young, the permanent leader of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first programme, Daley said that she felt like a little less young than everyone else, because it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and work.
He says: "To this day these emotions, to feel less and different have been the reality, and they have given me the power and energy I needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show himself to be “something, ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality would eventually be revealed.
The double Olympic Pronchismist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is present in the national competitions of this year to appeal to the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he came out because he feels lucky when he gets to live openly without sanctions, and he wanted to give the hope to others.
The Triple World Champion describes his love for a man – a American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "becoming a surprise".
Daley got married to this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she says the difference between age and age has never been a problem.
"If she experiences so many things when she was so young" – she participated in her first Olympics when she was 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later –" it is difficult to find another age who would have experienced similar problems and problems", Daley says.
In June, the couple received a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, which has resulted in a change in Daley's 'wide perspective'.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been rounded around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic Golden Ball."
His son was named by Daley's father, who died in 2011 only 40 years of age with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted his death, and one of the most recent issues he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympics tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he's not gonna be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I kept his hand when his breath stopped. Only when the breath had really stopped and he was dead, I finally realized that he was not insecure," he says.
Next year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of the public at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," says Daley.
This was also an enthusiasm in his first song selection, the Heather Small song "Proud", which was already aroused as he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin for chicken meat.

Half-health Mickelson on the exchange seats at Ryder Cup on Saturday
The U.S. Phil Mickelson is breaking the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be dramatically deceived in order to avoid the record to remain in history as an unhappy show.
Mickelson, who plays every two years in the event to play every two years, the record 12 times moved to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the four balls to be played on Saturday and foursome.
In general, the American five-fold major tournament winner, who is at the centre of attention, spent half a day as a cheerleader, and on the other side of the field, trying to take over his hit.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered as one of the most precise drivers in his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field where a long-grown cow is punishing the inaccurate hits.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson itself, the British Open winner, Francesco Molinari, is known for its accuracy in Sunday's ninth game, who plays together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, which aims to build up all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they get to the twin game, get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else might be said in a situation.
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He taped me in the back, routine and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is undeniably part of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but that's how it went, and that's what we ended up in.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record of several Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-years, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined into the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, clever, he keeps people at the expense of making jokes and he's a funny guy with whom everyone likes," he explains.
"Younger players must also have had fun with him this week.
He brings so much more into the team than I'm just gonna bet on the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long the leadership can disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from the experience that the leading position of Ryder Cup, before the last day's double games, can become a rude journey.
In 1997, the Danish player made his debut in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros was led by a five-point leading position in relation to the Americans, but who survived as a winner with lime lines just and just their nose and won with the hardest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we led in Valderrama, we led vigorously in Brookline, where we lost, but we won Valderrama, although scarcely," said Bjorn, after viewing the team's 5-3 wins in 2018, both Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 lead at Le Golf National Field.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we only aim at it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the world's best players."
I'm glad that his team players have completed the difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I'll never lick until I drop in such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, there are individual performance priorities, and then there are different issues to be discussed.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested with the bottoms.
This is a message that must be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who is allowed to go to [to the entrance alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the counterparty Captain Jim Furyk will require better performance from his players as individuals than they could do as partners. By way of derogation from this, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who gathered three points from four.
Furyk, in turn, has experienced the full translations of the last day in both directions. He was involved in the team that won Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won the Medinah miracle.
"I remember every word of the devil," he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed the lines of his team to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as it happened in Brookline, or as it happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on middle games.
We have arranged our composition according to it and put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence fight and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next to meet their European counterparts.
"I put a group of guys in this order because I think it will carry through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on the choices of two games.
The new German warship is delaying again
The newest fregat of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the vessel is to replace an obsolete cold-war equipment, but will be introduced early next year due to defective systems and explosive costs, reports local media.
According to the military reporter Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first category of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed for the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying afterhandling problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen fregats.
According to the available information, they are equipped with effective tyres, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface vessels, as well as blunt technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal detection techniques.
The important features of the ship also include its longer range of maintenance – new fregats should be able to operate in the sea for up to two years without visiting the port.
However, continuous delays mean that warships representing the top of technology, which are called to improve the influence of Germany in overseas areas, are already obsolete when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit magazine.
The poorly lucky F125 fregat ended up in the last year when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy will return the ship after it has been delivered.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media has spoken of essential "software and equipment failures" that make warship unfit for battleships.
The lack of software is particularly important because the size of the fleet of Baden-Württemberg class is about 120, which is only half of the crews of the older Bremen-class fregats.
It also showed that the ship is considerably overweight, thereby reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's potential for subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, whose capacity is 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the equivalent category ships used in the Second World War of Germany.
In addition to faulty equipment, there is also a problem with the whole project price base.
The price is multiplied by an increase of EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of access to the new fregats have arisen since the recent warning of the German maritime authorities is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament earlier this year, pointed out that the fleet's fertile ships are going to go down.
According to the Authority, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ships have been replaced.
He complained that no fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been used by the fleet.
The Environment Agency is listening to a secret life of bats
A new research carried out in the upper scotch area aims to determine how bats use the countryside in hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new study will provide a new light for the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future protection measures.
The National Trust for Scotland research conducted by scientists monitors the small and midget packs, as well as the replacements and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the vegetable garden in Wester Ross.
The study sets specific storage equipment into key points in the region to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
The staff and volunteers of the organisation shall also carry out mobile measurements using observation equipment.
The frequencies of votes and the species which are concerned shall be ensured by the analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, a life-environment map and a report will be drawn up in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture of the scale of the region.
Rob Dewar, the organization's natural advisor, wishes to reveal the results which areas of the habitat are the most important for the rests and how different species exploit them.
The information is helpful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of crops and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
Scotland and all UK bat populations have decreased considerably over the last 100 years.
Building and land building work threatens the resting sites and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, including fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials and pet cat attacks.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, due to the manner of hunting at night, their ears are of greater benefit to catching catches than eyes.
The bats use advanced echo positioning techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is a rural environment-driven organization that maintains over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take pillows seriously.
There are ten experts serving it who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of rest sites, and in some cases rescue activities for animals.
The organization has even established the first and only protected area for the protection of bats in Scotland in the territory of Dumfries and the Threave landscape in Galloway, and eight of the ten bat oils in Scotland are met in the area.
According to the farmer David Thompson, the area is ideal for the rest.
"Threave suits the rest very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, in all, a good living environment.
We do not know everything about bats, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of revising the buildings for bats prior to rehabilitation, because the destruction of a single bat can inadvertently cause up to 400 female lemons and children's deaths and destroy a whole local population.
Battery is prohibited from protecting animals and killing them, disturbing them or destroying their rest sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Baggage Protection Organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our pillows, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has identified the rape charges against him as "fail news" and says that people want to "maintain themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken up allegations to publish a German Der Spiegel magazine to sue the court.
The attacker in Portugal and Juvenus has been accused of raping the American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
They say he paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel is reporting on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in Instagram for 142 million successors only hours after allegations. The 33-year-old football player steeply rejected the charges and described them as "misleading".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player continued to smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel's challenge for claims that they have called Reuters' News Office "unacceptable reporting on the doubts of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player demands compensation for "personal suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to a player's room where he is alleged to be raped analoguely, according to the documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and told him that he's a 99% good guy, but whose "one percent" disappointed.
According to the papers, Ronaldo has confirmed the sex of a couple, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later he ended up in a reconciliation solution because he was "rettent to the possibility of vengeance" and he was concerned "to be subject to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says now that he is seeking annulment of the reconciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian mighty team in Juvenus with a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "repent forever" at the end of the car production
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it would lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the brexit, Minister of Economics Greg Clark said.
He added that he would be "careable" to the announcement by the UK Unit of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Derby in Burnaston if Britain leaves the EU without the agreement.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer says the effect of the delays in the borders is seen as loss of jobs if the brexite ends without a contract.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, manufactured nearly 150 000 cars last year, which was exported to the European Union by 90%.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be interrupted," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of exit from the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced its closure of Mini’s manufacturing factory for a month in the event of brexit.
The most important concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the non-contractual brexit.
The Toyota production line is rotated with a timely JOT principle, where parts come to the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border, which could lead to delays and difficulties.
Maintaining more than a day-to-day storage in the Derbyshire factory is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be stopped.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "accurately calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement: we want the best possible agreement that does not just mean success in the current situation, but is the opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but also the opinions of other manufacturers show that we must absolutely be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell us how long production should be stopped, but warns that additional costs should reduce the installation's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is acting as a branch of a trade union at the factory, says that there is a growing concern among the members: "The jobs I have ever lost will never return.
The government reporter says: "We must present a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the EU."
The meeting of the Trump with Rosenstein may be late again, the White House will inform you.
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be "need to move again a week" around the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, due to the obligation of debt, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which, in turn, examines Russia's involvement in elections, the links between Trump's assistants to Russia and the President to prevent any judicial action.
In Washington, months have been announced Trump's intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise Mueller's investigation's neutrality.
Previously on this month, the New York Times reports to Rosenstein on the possibility of recording secret discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of dissolving the President on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Mr Rosenstein has denied the data of the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to resign from Rosenstein.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced to Thursday.
Trump said that he would rather not erode Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because that time was coincided with the hearing of the Senate's judiciary, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who blamed him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday Trump ordered an FBI weekly study on the arguments put forward against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the vote of the Senate plenary.
Mr. Trumpi's press manager, Sarah Sanders, played at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "The day has not been set for it; it could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to what is happening in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since 10 September.
The news speaker Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the cause of the lack of press conferences is due to other reasons than the disgust of the 'note demand' of TV suppliers, but said, 'I do not deny the fact that they are remarkable'.
But Sanders said that the direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him", he says, and adds evidence without quote: "We have checked those numbers."
"The press conferences will still be organised", Sanders said, but "It is incredibly much better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We often try to do this, and you have seen us do this several times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open events or press conferences with visitors.
Presenting alone in a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this in the event of an obstructive and occasionally strange presence of journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland’s Public Health System (NHS Scotland) regarding fears of brexit
The Minister for Health has written a letter to Scottish healthcare workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after the brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter when the time for the United Kingdom to resign from the EU is less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of the applications for the 'standing status' of EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-contractual distinction.
I know you all have these insecure times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we appreciate every employee's contribution to citizenship.
Colleagues from and from all parts of the EU bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for the main injury of the emergency surgery
The Tennessee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessea editor Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's coach Rod Reed told journalists that an injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and simply got short of it," says Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on batteries and took him to the side for more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State's editor told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been in surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information on the type/species of the infringement at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays first through the team after he moves from Illinois.
He had five sticks on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 sticks this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of this amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year — to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform you today of the higher level of stamp tax from foreign buyers when they buy properties in Britain.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp is targeted at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to Britain.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax, may be up to three per cent in addition to the 2nd dwelling and investment dwelling increases that have been added two years ago.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to produce up to GBP 120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of London's renovations are purchased by non-Green Britain residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for the purchasers of primary dwellings on the market.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain, especially its capital, have become ‘hotel cities’ because several foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed to lower the tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first-age dwellings.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high by buying the country and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for affordable dwellings in order to remedy the situation of the British 'skinnified dwelling'.
Corby has published a series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on mountains and the termination of "intensive extinctions".
He would also like to give the delegations more power on new buildings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I intend to own the British dream of my Prime Ministerial term – that every generation of life should be better than its predecessor – to restore it.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad can buy apartments as easily as rough residents in Britain.
Too many people have become a far-reaching dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to lead the Scotland country team."
Jack Ross, Director of Sunderland, says his "principal objective" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland is enthusiastic in its challenge to raise the country's northeast corner of the team that holds its home on its feet. The team is currently in third position in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "stadium of lights" this summer after he had directed St. Mirren back to Scotland's electoral time last year.
"When I was a gamer, I wanted to play in my country's team.
I got to the second team and it was there," Ross says at the BBC in Scotland's Sportssound.
"I often watched my father with Scotland's games with Hampden as a child, and it's something that's always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come up if I succeed as the manager of the company."
Mr Ross's predecessors, including Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic leader says that there was no concern for entering the boots of his nominated predecessors in an anonymous company, who has previously rejected Barnsley and Iptswich Town's offers.
"This is the moment I have my own success, because if I can return this company to the election time.
Based on the structure and ability of the association, it is undoubtedly part of the electoral age," he says.
"It's not easy to get in there, but I'd probably think I'd be successful only if I can trust the team back with the electoral time."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first, Dumbarton's Deputy Director and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
After this, he helped Alloa to rise from the third series of fallen games and raised St Mirren from the fallen state of the next season to the masters.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"I was probably on a real road crossing with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
"I really believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned moderately and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I still go through the same things, such as stress and pressure from work, but leading the team seems to be the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for myself, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever had a grown-up life."
The whole interview is to be heard at Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the chair is Saturday at 17.30, the study shows
The thermal wave of the summer has fired the pubs that struggled with the difficulties of the United Kingdom, while at the same time exploding more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% during July, but the output of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures drawn up by Peter Martin's business consultant from CGA say: "Continuous solar weather and longer participation in the football world championships in England meant that July formed a kind of pub sales of 2.8% higher, while a month was worse for restaurants.
The June 1.8% decrease in the sale of restaurants only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars concentrated on the drink side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decrease in the sales of restaurants.
Nutrition centered pubs also suffer from grace but less dramatically than restaurant spinners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
Sales of bubbles and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month and sales of food decreased by 3%."
As regards the RSM company providing the free-time and hotel consultancy services, Paul Newman says: "The results continue to follow trends that have continued since the end of April.
The weather and large social or sports events are still the largest factors that affect the sale of the non-house food market.
There is no surprise that the struggle with the restaurant chains continues, although the decline in the annual sales of 4.8% is squeezing, especially now that the sector is currently fighting with cost pressures.
A long, hot summer could not have become worse for those who concentrated on foods, and only time would show if the film temperatures would bring the breath break that is urgently needed in the sector.
The total increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowdown in the creation of new brands.

Fifteen children secretly social media accounts from their parents
Fifth part of the children – some of whom are up to 11 years – keep secret social media accounts from their parents and teachers – reports
The study of 20 000 upper secondary school pupils revealed the growing phenomenon of the Instagram feiking accounts
The news made me worried that the accounts can share sexually susceptible content
20% of the students told them that they held a "capital account" that is shown to parents
Fifth of the children — some of whom are up to 11 years of age — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study of 20 000 upper secondary school students revealed the rapid increase in the existence of Instagram fake accounts, referring to the Instagram site for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that the accounts can publish sexually passionate content.
20% of the pupils told them that they considered the cleaned ‘head account’ to be shown to parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped to be raped after hitting her 13 - year - old daughter's secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rehtorie Consultation Board (HMC), 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles and half of the respondents admitted to holding secret accounts.
The director of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to setting up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle "Athletes' voice" to the government of athletes in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletes' Government, who is not in charge of the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the best athlete in Scotland. Ian Beattie, the Chairman of the Government, describes the name as a fine opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the extensive, international experience collected by athlete during the last decade.
"In Scotland, the United Kingdom and internationally, I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government", Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I am eager to wait for my role as an athletes to play, and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
Four American athletes winning the Olympic culture who won 200 meters and 400 metres in 1996 at Atlanta, and now acting as a permanent commentator of BBC, lost their walking ability as a result of a transient brain blood circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I got a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, it's only time to show up, to recover, and to what condition.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm already working on agitation!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mommy cow-like advertising share opinions online
Advertising mothers with milk cows that make breast pumps has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, the manufacturer of consumer technology, has placed on the market a product called "the world's first silent and dressable chest pump." Its marketing is accelerated by a advertising of the language made in the cheek and music video style, which describes the freedom of the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers of real life dance in the hains filling, among other things, the following songs said: "Yes, I will lyp myself, but the tail doesn't see" and "If you didn't notice, they're not twists, they're tits."
The sound continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I grease my songs."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company led to a discussion online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments gathered videos have raised contradictory reactions in viewers, many say it's ruining the daily ‘reverends’ of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision was to use the magazines to advertise this product.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them shortly after birth," writes one commentary.
Elvie breast pump is undetectable in the breast vest (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: "I understand it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a chest pump to mothers who can keep their baby?"
The third commentator added: "Full reality advertising."
I also received the ad defenders: one woman admitted that the ad was "fastic".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breast-feeding.
Bumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads in one of the comments.
The second viewer commented: "This is a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (use of jobs or toilets) and "feel themselves cows".
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, women reveal that they have danced undetectable pumps in their bras in islands.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely silent, it does not have wires and hoses, and it is unacceptable within the breast-feeding vessels, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, the shareholder and artistic leader of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "Elvie pump is a devastating product that earned a bold and provocative entry on the market.
By breast-feeding the breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of the chest pump into the light, we brought up the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump in a pleasant and identifiable way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
In London’s fashion weeks, two children’s mothers appeared in the catwalk designer Marta Jakubowski’s costume using a product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border in all quiet
Even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, the number of immigrants has grown dramatically, due to the rhetorics and policies of the Trump regime, the placement of children in subsistence families has become difficult.
Most subsistence families are traditionally composed of unwritten migrants, and registration as a subsistence family can jeopardise their own residence in the country.
Risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible subsistence families and other adults in the economy should provide fingerprints and that these information will be shared with immigrant authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High-Level Entry and Customs Authority, witnessed last week that the Agency had arrested tens of people who had applied for sub-leasers.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had no prior criminal record.
"The 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue looking for these people," says Albence.
In order to speed up the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with at the court within a month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day deadline previously in place, the staff of the reception centre shall be informed.
Many will rather be present through a video conference rather than in personal driving in the court of immigrants' affairs.
Those who are not regarded as legitimate to help are expelled quickly.
According to the reports published in recent months by the reception centres and by the system, the time spent in prison for children will affect whether children are beginning to suffer anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent discharges or refugee companies.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly stressed in larger establishments, such as Tornillo, where signs of the child’s despair can not be noticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders the American, French and Turkish "management forces" to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is going to war for eight years.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country, using the excuse to fight terrorism, and that "they will act with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and thereafter, and millions of people have been forced to flee from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue the "holy battle until the whole Syria was cleaned" from both terrorist organisations and "unlawed foreign forces".
The United States has around 2 000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mainly training and guided by the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested in fighting to tear down over 1,000 soldiers' departments.
Moualem said that the conditions were good for the return and accused 'some Western countries' of spreading 'irrational fears' that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have invited international community and assistance organisations to facilitate these refunds," he said.
"They politicized a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid before the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomatics, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer area at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the widespread attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "explicit time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would be directed against jihadis, including those in the al-Qaida-related al-Nusra fronts, "who will be destroyed".
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that it will soon be able to invite the first meetings of the new Government and of the opposition Committee to create the draft Syrian Constitution after war and to settle the road for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revising the provisions of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another season
According to this logic, President Trump would win the elections for 2020 unless, as many Liberal Viewers are likely to hope, post and scandal decide his premature premature presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic decision of the presidency ever!"
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have doubled over 1,05 million CNN and almost tripled by 1,6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best viewing time compared to 1.7 million people four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has reached the cable TV: top readings with 3.5 million viewers as the most important news records.
"This is a rubbish that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, who will rise as President after the attack was destroyed.
Nell Scowel, who is an experienced comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trum.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovall says.
The chaox has fun value.
By way of derogation from other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe v Wade happens, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes outside the responsibilities of the informing citizen to look at six hours of expert panels, which argues that Bob Woodward's source data is used for Fear, Paul Manafort's 15 000 dollar pilot coat (Washington Post says "the vulnerability of the jacket") and Stormy Daniels' president Trump's anatomy-related undecorated illustrations.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again the same way I used to.

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a lovely sunshine on the North Coast, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to withdraw from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on the Ombudsman and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outside, there's money flowing into a rigorous mid-selection
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has encountered a real cash flow, because, due to the reorganisation of the congressional circles, two candidates already selected must fight from one place.
This recent restored Pittsburg constituency is a challenge for the Conor Lamb of the Democrats, who was in place from the second constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is in competition with the second elected candidate, the Republicans Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12 electoral circuits of Pennsylvania, which is duplicate with the new 17 constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old constituent division favoured the Republicans against the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17 constituent district has launched economic struggles in the Finance Sections of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic of Campaign Committee (NCRCC).
Lamb's name was known after the special elections of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, who were extensively followed in Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania.
The place had been in the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won the region by 20%.
Political commentators have set a fine front for the Democrats.
The United States planned a punishment for El Salvador for supporting China, but retired from its intentions.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and a mild response to Washington.
President Trumpi had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners deported the Trump Organization Team.
The officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to invite the American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "conclusive orientations that Taiwan is no longer recognised", said Heather Nauert earlier in his opinion this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, who received an estimated EUR 140 million of assistance from the United States in 2017 for drug control, including development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been severely hit by the Central America State with a high level of unemployment and homicide crime.
During internal meetings, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step forward in companies to prevent migrants from attempting to move to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that the meeting was intended to progress and that it effectively decided speculation on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some sign of the importance of the administration to the meeting, the diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in all silences without any new miserable messages or punishment from Washington.
Bolton’s White House’s reporter refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, with two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report confirmed an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History Teach
The next inevitable step may be Robert Mueller's report on the possible prevention of the right of President Trump, which is now very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to lead the investigation into whether the Trump campaign was secretly involved in cooperation with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If there is a change in power in the Congress, President Trump will notice that he is accountable to it just when he is preparing to go again before his electorate, and he will have to be able to judge his peers.
There are a lot of congratulations here, and I do not mean that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - more than the loss of the people in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will take place.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to expel Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the following years.
The course of history turns into such turning points where the undeniable path of democracy is either accelerating or delaying.
The Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation of the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been flooded since the public became aware that he had proposed to record the secret president's speech and to consider the President's possible inability to manage his mission.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is mistaken.
"How do we react if the recent FBI investigation of the activities of Brett Kavanugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible arguments of sexual harassment and unfair witnesses?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-elections for a congress that holds President Trum responsible?
If we fail in these causes, our democracy will be in the long and dark winter.
But I believe that we are successful in the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.

Rangers Graham Dorrans as a optimistic meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will meet at home on Thursday of Rapid Vienna, knowing that after a fight against Villarreal in Spain earlier in the same month, the winning of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the G block of the European Union.
The knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a popboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," says a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we could have caught the end of the victory, but all in all, the game is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better at the first half, and we got on the other side, and we were better.
On Thursday, it will be an important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it'll be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this set we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough for my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good, and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can now push full, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes nights’ sleep from women
Although the researchers had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their closest.
Approximately half of the participants in the countrywide study reported their discussions with their spouse on the cost of long-term care.
Only ten percent of the respondents said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about them," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and to your children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell me your wishes in time.
Talk to professionals and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost-driven factor.
Incorporate financial advice into the debate: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
For example, financial options for long-term care may be traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance or self-cost insurance to cover these costs, if you can afford.
Create legal documents: preventing disputes.
Get a health representative on the spot so you can designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals do not respond to your wishes in case you cannot communicate with them.
Consider also the drafting of the authority for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Remember also the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Can you answer her medication and questions about her allergies?
Write such information into the plan to prepare for the situation.
"It's not just for economics, but who's his doctor?" Martin asks.

Landquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami who attacked Please in Indonesia on Friday. According to officials, the number of victims is expected to increase.

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president of the candidate, Track Pal, has been arrested for assault.
According to the Alaska police's Saturday report, Palin, 29 of Alaskan Wasilla, was arrested suspected of domestic violence and of the prevention and opposition of domestic violence in connection with arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from a female partner when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is imprisoned in the Mat-Su Pretrial Penitentiary, and the guarantee is fixed at $500, reporting TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and said he was "not guilty."

He's also being accused of a class B offence that can be sentenced to the day of imprisonment and $2,000 fines.
Palin's not the first time in charge of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of the assault of his father, Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported assassination.
The case is currently being dealt with in Alaska's veteran law.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving the possession of a weapon under the influence of the drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting her face.

Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake attacked Sulawes on the island in Indonesia on Friday.
At its power, 7.5 magnetic earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electro-communication links are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia outside the Sulawes centre.
The social media circulates videos from the time of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festivals Please in the city when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors are considering the suspicion of a rare death penalty against the NYC terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipoville, the suspect of eight human lives in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state since 1953 for a federal offence.
According to the accusation, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car on the southern part of Manhattan on the West Side Highway bike road where he drove on the pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for a death penalty in the southern region of New York, a death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed eight victims of "intended" and caused "intended" serious physical injury.
According to the case-law, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
Week after the attack, the federal court imposed 22 charges against Saipoville, including eight murders to assist the terrorist organisation, typically using this criminal code in cases involving organised crime, and the prosecution of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "remarkable planning and preparation", the prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov committed his actions to be "surprising, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harms and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For the last time, the law of the southern province of New York has issued a death penalty has passed a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to a life sentence for imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has been last implemented in New York in the Federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed conspiracy for the Soviet Alliance during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of repentance over the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the scientists he felt good about what he did, and the police told me.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had received an inspiration after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov wanted an ISIS ticket in his hospital room.
He replied to the 22-judgment that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the Federal Defence Attorneys of Saipov, said that the defence was a "naturally disappointed" prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to require death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of liberation is a solution which only prolongs the trauma caused by the parties to these events," said Patton.
Saipov's defence had previously asked him not to be charged with death penalty.
The Conservative Parliamentary Representative says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage promised today in the demonstration against the Conservatives "mobilise the civilian army."
The former Ukip Director said that politicians must know the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives proposed him to conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative liner, said to the marshals in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be "outside" if Farage was a brexit secretary.
But May meets the gaps of its divided lines in reconciling the challenge underlined by the conservatives on the standpoint of the stay, which joined the demonstration against a separate brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his proposal for a Chequers compromise on the surface of the supporters and opponents of the Brexte, and the EU.
The supporters call on him to continue his attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the retreat - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposals and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave's event in Solihull he wanted to "shook the Chequers proposal away."
He proposed that Farage be included and that it should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out already," he said.
Wellingborough's Parliamentary representative added: "I'm trying to break the brex, but we have to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He said to the EU's responsiveness: "We did not fight world wars to end up subject.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country."
Bone struck the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely mistaken argument."
Mr Jenkyns, who supports the conservative brexit, also took part in the marshal and said to the journalists, "I only say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it will not be supported by the members of the party, nor by the activists who are really on the streets and are ultimately responsible for our success.
"Resign from the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers shall keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to twist the decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want the politicians who are about to twist the brex, they have to feel the pressure on your part."
"We are going to mobilise the army of citizens in this country, which gave us victory in the brex vote, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is once again an independent, self-governmental and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched across Birmingham before a two-hour opportunity in the city centre.
A small group of activists twisted the "Tories Against Brexit" signs, and the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party ridiculed the conservatives of the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they will get the IT systems in place and all the techniques for Canada plus plus plus and unsealised border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a full fart.
There is no good brex." he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidate.
According to US Senator Elizabeth Warren, he is seriously considering the candidate for President after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the massachustic democrat spoke about his future at the city house in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for repeated criticism of President Trump, will meet in November the republican Geoff Diehl, who was jointly chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been suspected to stand up against Trum in the 2020 elections.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters of the town after the beginning of Trump's season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to pursue the president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest place.
Arrest in the LSU's Sims shooting case
Louisianan Baton Rouge's police reported on Saturday that he arrested a person suspected of shooting the LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims's dead Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET briefing.
The police had released a video from the shooting scene on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who saw it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus area of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result of it," told the media by Murphy J. Paul through the Sports network on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was present at the interrogation, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't take the stand and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-century junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 at the start of the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 disks per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup after offering him a win from Sebastian Vetel
When the Valter Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was obvious that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good departure and left Hamilton almost his own happiness in defending his place on the first two rounds inviting his teammates.
Vettel first went to the fortress and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of heels, which should have been solved.
Mercedes went on a tour later and returned after Vetti, but Hamilton moved over a little contact and the Ferrari driver moved in responsively from the internal line, relinquishing his investment after two thirds of his movement.
Max Verstappe, who spent his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was the seventh round after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition while prolonging the exchange of tyres when aiming at a fast stop and taking the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
Eventually, he came to the fortress on the 44th round, but he was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when he took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valter was doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman when he got past me.
The team has made an exceptional career with a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad for your body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked the argument of Senator Dianne Feinstein that he did not leak to the public the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of the sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh.
When speaking in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on the Ombudsman, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of the people's 'faith, malicious and dishonest'.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the President said.
"When we see publications and bedless things and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you year up this data?
Do you remember his answer... did you year the document... ‘ Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't bleed," he added the senator to it.
In July Feinstein received a letter describing the accusations of Fordin Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein refused that the bleeding would have occurred in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was not valid for the President who commented on the matter on Saturday's occasion: "I will tell you that that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in the body."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the Democrats would use accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to return to power by any means possible.
You see that evil and evil, they don't care who they hurt, or who they must walk over to power and rule," says Mediaite as the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer made two paints for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the defeat of the Elite League fight against Belfast Giants on Friday by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had the lead in the early stage thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's two paintings.

Micronesia's flight accident: Air Niugin says one person is missing after the plane crashes into the lagoon
In Micronesia, in the Pacific, the airline airline representatives of the Lagonian airline now say that one person is missing, although the previous report indicates that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the deploying aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to locate one male passenger.
The airline announced attempting to find a man in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and accidental investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information on lost passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people were left in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the disaster and the exact course of the events are still unclear.
The airline and the US fleet have both reported the plane landed in the Lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was driving over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes told me the plane landed very low.
"It is a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to shackle in a sinking machine in a belt-sweet water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger staff he was panic and screaming, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. fleet reported that the sailors who had been involved in the repairs of the nearby docks took part in rescues by transporting people on the shore with a shaft before a plane sank into a deep water of about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the detriment of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in damage.
An analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended the re-treatment in which a man was accused of burning a woman of Missessippi alive in 2014.
An analyst at the US Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on the cell phone to gather together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements at the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data of several mobile phones, which showed Tellis’ opposition to his previous arguments with Chambers during the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be his friend Michael Sanford, the police interviewed Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the information recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final speeches of the defence are designed to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What do you know about hip hop?
The Hip hop trio wants to challenge the gene-related negative ideas by making music full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol The High Breed, hip hop is distant from the original, with messages linked to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of the hip hop and make the knowledgeable hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been able to prove the new increase in Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark man?
New York babysitter is suing a couple for a racist text message
New York babysitter challenges the couple's right of discriminatory separation after accidentally obtaining a child's mother's text message, which complains that he's "yes one dark."
The couple denies being racists and a challenge of "creation."
Two children's mothers Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed their concern when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on his first day of work in 2016 and became aware that this was dark.
"EIIIII, THANKING", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband a text message.
But then he sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of his husband, twice.
According to Plasco-Flaxman, according to the New York Post, the troubled mistake that he made, Maurice had been fired by an afro-American child nurse who had received his previous passports and had been waiting for the Philippines this time.
Maurice got paid for one day of his work, and he was sent home with a cab.
Now, Maurice challenges the couple's court to obtain compensation for disbursement, and he wants to make $350 per day for a period of six months for which he had originally been washed to live and work in a family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist statements, saying that the decision to terminate Maurice's employment was a reasoned solution because they could not rely on him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child with someone you've been unfriendly to, even if it's just an accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco compared the challenge with the blackmail, and I said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was "a very difficult situation."
"Would we start chasing another one in a situation like this?
It is not very comfortable," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still under way, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple’s social media, making their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were afraid that the audience would not be identifiable to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to reside in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
As to the fact that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to the writing of children's books about toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
Paddington was “a very important family member” and said his father was quietly proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't at all a shiny guy," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like the child’s achievement to him; one that you are proud of, even though it is not really your own accomplishment.
I think he's experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always honored Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing in Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, his daughter had been stretched on the plane, where the doctors tried to save his life in vain.
"Nad called a little bit of a difference and told me that the situation was really bad, not expected to survive," says Ednan-Laperouse.
And then they called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes, and I have to say goodbye to him on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, sweetie.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Medicines that allowed doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was about to end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I had families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving of her daughter's loss, rose into the plane among other passengers who didn't know anything about the trial he was undergoing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and the tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt great sympathy for Nadi.
That she needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
The grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler was sick of depression when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want anyone's parents to experience the emotions that I know every day," he said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious vibration.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would light the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of post-impacts.
Davis created cards "to tell people that there are people who can go to talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't be silence, you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner after 15 years of coexistence soon after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened their gifts, they didn't take their eye contact or anything like it."
He says that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they have to go on: "It breaks the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation.
"I was thinking that if we could really achieve what he was hoping for - timely and scale-limited research - we could perhaps create a little coherence", Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be "degraded" to the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to inquire the FBI?
It's about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the success of the Republicans is weak, as expected, their efforts to make the man they want to choose will be difficult for the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to allow them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met through her wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What's going on after the FBI report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes, in which case Vice-President Mike Pence could blow through the game and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean lobbyers falls during Kim
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of persons displaced from North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came in seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the Ministry of Integration in South Korea and reported that there were 1 127 in 2011, 2 706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices of human traffickers.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's locomotives will eventually be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
From Soul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone between the Cores.
China treats locomotives as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and mostly restores them.
However, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations at stopping nuclear weapons.
This followed the June historic meeting, in which President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level to pursue a Korean peninsula nuclear disarmament.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of imprisonment after the meeting.
"Without any confidence in the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and, in any event, in such circumstances, we will not unanimously dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Your Nancy Pel calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, minority director, called the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh as a "hysterical" and said that this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
You were afraid to comment on this at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, he would be called "hysterical", your fear said his own reaction to the statement of witnesses by Kavanaugh before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very emotionally denying the accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in power of emotions and sometimes he almost screamed and lost his speech skills when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the members of the committee, without calling for accusations against themselves as "grotesk and planable persecution", organised by the Liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss.
Your fear said that he believed that Kavanaugh's witness statement would show that this is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be a party to democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent in his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
You were afraid to ask him whether he would prosecute Kavanaugh if this was to be confirmed and if the Democrats were to have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, and also for the court in which he's currently working," your fear answered.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the Federal Court of Appeal of the United States.
Your fear added that, as a democrat, he was concerned by the possible provisions of Kavanaugh in relation to health reform or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative prosecutor.
In its consultations on confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to be elected as a member of justice and we would be expected to say that it is amazing," said Pel.
Women need to get through everything.
This is a legitimate fire speech in the face of months and years of rage, and he cannot cry without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying too when she got angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying:"You think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm really mad."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was genius."
The tears are justified as a way of rage, even though they are generally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my early workplace in a male-powered office is when I cried out of rage and the older woman, a cold-skilled superior, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me in the neck and dragged me into the staircase.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and then they'll be happy, because they got your mind upset."
Patricia Schroeder, Congressman of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 by a non-married relationship with a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not seek to become president himself.
"It wasn't a very well-considered decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven people already, and at least one more one was needed.
Someone called the situation "Snow and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign time was long, he was behind the coincidence and so he announced he would not go to the race unless he could get two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave a thousand dollars to candidates gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he kept his speech and announced that he would not enter into a formal campaign, he was subjected to his feelings of gratitude to his supporters, the frustration system that made it so difficult to collect funds for the election work against the electoral and delegations, and the anger against sexism that he could not speak.
"I could have thought I'd get a nervous break," Schroeder remembers the press's reactions.
"I could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone will be be beaten for a memoir.
"He cried."
How the US-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The launch shot for the US and Chinese trade war was earshuming and even though the fight is not over, the breakdown in the countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
The President of the United States Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the most important export articles of China, which are included in solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week on the basis of new customs duties affecting import goods at USD 200 billion (150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported into the United States of China.
Beijing has responded each time to the same dimension, with the last setting of 5% to 10% of customs duties on American import goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-style, and does not seem to have the second largest economic power in the world to devastate for a moment.
To allow Washington to retreat, we should give up on our own demands, but the public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating to the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US Trade War can be positive to China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A small political decision, either in Washington or in Beijing, can create conditions that start the economic cycle in one of the countries, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the side reviewers have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant at the Center for New American Security in Asia.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to return refugees.
Syria says that he is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in reconstruction after a devastating war that lasts over seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country would improve.
"Your view is now more stable and safer because of the development in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and their daily life and unilateral economic activities.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government did not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won 2018 by winning Ryder Cup at the U.S. team's endpoints 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National field outside of Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won Ryder Cupi in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the U.S. star player, had trouble almost all the time in the tournament, and he hit his start-up in the water on the 16th path of the par-3-rail, giving a fight to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari glorified all rounds and became one of the four players who have received the result of 5-0-0 since the tournaments started in its present form in 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth came out with the result of 5 and 4 European teams with the lowest ranked player, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost the result of the 2th and 1 English Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European of all time at a 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It is a team and I am glad that I may have been able to help," said Garcia moved after the European team's victory.
He transfers the beam to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday 2+1.
"I feel great pride after I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him," 23 years old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now he has Ryder Cup record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 great winners and will remain the second only for Jack Nicklau.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding routes all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said that after his team failed: "I'm proud of these friends, they fought.
We pushed the European team in the games this morning.
We put it in the glove.
Respect Thomas.
He's a great captain.
