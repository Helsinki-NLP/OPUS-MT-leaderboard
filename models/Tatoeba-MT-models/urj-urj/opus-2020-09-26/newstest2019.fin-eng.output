Emili Kouki led Hurricane's home win in the opening, Savo Volley's second win.
Following seven times a succession in the men's balloon Championship medals of Hurricane Loimaa started the season 2018-19 at home victory when Raision Loimu crashed on Saturday 3-0.
Emeli Kouki, the returning player from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some inquiries abroad, but they were not realised, and then came a call from Loma.
It was pretty fast that we had a deal, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen also played in Loimus with Koukia at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the match-by-measure country planner Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal pipe is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points Savo Volley's most effective when the team was knocked off by Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was stubborn, especially in the head of the attack, but fortunately we got a squeezed victory.
At least I didn't have any information about a different download when I was playing against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3-series, made 12 points in the Aerial Ball next to the 2000-01 series.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small, or mood in the roof all the time.
The good guy left his house opening.
Miro was a king. He played a good game, too.
The last season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in the Sammo of Pielave, while Tuovise was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective 14 points in Ducks.
Mikkonen again, the star of Aka-Volley
During the period 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening win after he dropped the Kokkolan Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun very well from its own place.
Of course, today, the loss was close because we had one fourth of the 17-21 losses.
We've been digging a victory somewhere, and the fifth set came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few months ago still in the final matches of Tigers the most effective was 28 points made by hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
I didn't get much on a guy's hacker, Mikkonen praised.
In comparison to human capital, Finland is the world's number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparing human capital, reports Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland.
Later, Holland was located on one higher and instead of Canada, it was found on the list in Taiwan.
In 2016, the worst comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population will be examined.
The World Bank has set human capital links with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois controlled Atletico, the local game ended as a painting.
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled into the glorious fights, and the local game of Madrid teams ended up in a fictionless game late Saturday in the Spanish football League.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois was playing at Atletico three times on the loan line when he was a Chelsea player.
In the first week, the International Football Alliance Fifa chose him to be the goalkeeper of the year.
In the real world, the best goal was to get Gareth Bale, but his shot was headed over at the end of the opening half of the goal.
After a break, Bale was switched for a thigh injury.
According to the ESPN, the disappointed Realists screamed in the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo.
The United States is now attacking the right to abortion - a powerful document tells us why.
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by Mr Donald Trump's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decision known as Roe Wade could be revoked by Kavanaugh with a decisive vote, which made an abortion in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various support from the majority of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of a powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left as the only doctor in the state of Missour for abortion due to the blackmail of the laws.
The armed guard of the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind you of the killing terrorist attacks that have been done to the clinics.
Let's move on at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churchmen's association guided women to administer abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interrogated pastor is good, but they don't even need them, a photo of the woman who died for abortion.
There was about 5,000 deaths in the United States a year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Even in California in 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan was signed by the abortion law.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, started to confuse religion with political constituent.
His abortion stock also twisted his successor, George Bush's parents.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
To the deepest core of the matter, a document was documented at the top of the search for the grounds for the politicisation of abortion.
When tax exemption was denied from religious organisations that benefited from the race, they became politically active.
They picked an abortion for a stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
When writing this in the United States, there is a situation in which the President, who has taken the voices of the religious right to abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can have a vast power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, on the border of great demonstrations.
Approximately 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the 12 and 14-year-olds.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
These are 89 bullets wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened the fire and took an air strike in the border zone when the demonstrators threw the troops of Israel with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has started the use of force to prevent demonstrators from breaking the border or attempting it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza's demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12 000 are wounded.
The demonstrators demanded access to the Palestinian families, from which the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli state was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
The explosives that have been dropped by lions and helium balls from the Palestinian side have lit forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
The whole thing, Santa's got a hit of punishment, and he couldn't shoot himself.
The top pair of Wigan, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have knocked him down in the penitentiary area behind him.
Prisoner Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tactic was clean.
Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation stayed to bother the divorce judge Ward, who condemned Norwich by the 85th minute after Santa fell.
Ward showed me a glimpse of punishment, and Mario Vrancic squeezed a 1-0 winning painting.
Santa's done five paints for Norwich in the Championship.
Last Saturday, the last one was born against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
Working tasted for Puk again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended without tiredness.
The match for Norwich was five in two weeks.
The team continues in the liigacup.
There's a five-wind tube behind.
Auxiliary Pedophile Service was immediately completed by reservations - in Finland about 40,000 experiments with children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small number of women experience at least some sexual interest in premier ages.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Children or young people who are sexually interested have so far been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Assistance Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in spring, the Sexpo, which provides counselling and therapy, started an e-mail e-mail and the meeting hours were very quickly completed, Yle reports.
These are promised, however, in autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
Most of the pedophilic emotions in themselves have not performed their fantasies and thus did no criminal.
However, satisfaction is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass them and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Ylelle sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
I think it's worth the job if a child saves sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The Korean leaders or the Congoan gynecologist?
The United States President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the prize.
The background is Trump's role in obtaining North Korea, at least at speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites of peace to be received by Nobel are the coincidences of the South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-u, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the rings is significant, because last year the gaps were good.
Yet, for years, the reward of Kim, which leads to nuclear threats and land with iron extract, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The beneficiaries of Nobel Prizes will be made public since Monday, and on Friday it will be the most remarkable, i.e. Peace Prize.
If a prize is not awarded to those involved in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is Congo doctor Denis Mukwege.
The valued gynecologist has taken care of thousands of women victims of mass destruction in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there are 331 candidates to receive the prize.
The names of candidates are not reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel could.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said smiling.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee on Prize has often given recognition to the people and organisations representing liberal democracy and the multitude of world order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have received the prize, all of which have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding the Trump would require a ideological full translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire declaration in tunnel: Drivers acted like sopuls and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that happened on September 8th took place on the 1st Dragon.
As a result of the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out it was a system failure, the fire department sought to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road with a silk shock and they're driving how it hurts, the vigilante fireman Pasi Kääriainen told STT that she was fresh at that time.
At that time, the motorway was left even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the rules of transport, a few others are often followed, the contact manager of traffic security Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
According to transport rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for forced reasons.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, transport can not be jeopardised by urgent solutions.
The alarm vehicles shall always provide as unacceptable as possible.
In the opposite direction, driving on the motorway is prohibited in particular, as well as making and withdrawing the U translation.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlamps must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without compulsive cause, as is, of course, parking.
In recent cases, even the driver has stopped at the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Communication.
Ilves would have wanted to continue their party even if the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake.
Inland waterway ship M/S The Ilves fans transported in Tampere would have wanted to stay on board to continue the victory party, even though the ship had been caught on the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrj, who was the leader of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, took off his way late on Saturday night and stuck on the bottom of his bow in Vanajavede in Aka.
19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was injured.
Ilves would have wanted to continue their party in the ship until morning, but, of course, it was more reasonable to send them to the fire department on the way to the port and home by the bus, said Syrja to STT.
Ilves had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK match, which ended with Ilves 4-3 wins.
According to the margin, Saturday's friend was due to the fact that the surface of the water in the Old Yave had about half a foot lower than normal.
According to Syrja, the fact that the nearest track mark was covered by the lobby, which caused its reflectors not to appear normally in the dark autumn.
No more collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalm shortly after the sea route had undermined the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki motorways.
The greater drama was not associated with the case, according to the Syrja, because the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground did not result in a more remarkable impact.
According to the margin, catching on the ground has not caused leakage or pressing on the ship, and with these visions the cruises of the ship will continue normally.
The diver came on Saturday morning to check the ship’s properness before the ship was towed off the mattress.
For the sake of certainty, we are still going to the dock to check that there was no damage, says Syrja.
The margin believes that the next cruise busted in M/S Tampere next weekend can be conducted in a consensus.
According to him, the ship's cruise period will continue until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday nights a little after twelve.
The violin port was alerted for ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
In the late evening, a lofty fireman, Matti Willman, told us that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult for darkness and pretty bad wind.
Pirkanmaa's rescue facility announced half after three nights before Sunday that all those on board have been evacuated and that passengers have been transferred to Tampere by bus.
In the year 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Tribunal of Trump, who is accused of harassment and drinking, may not have a top job.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain unemployed, assessing the programme director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up posting another person.
In the United States, even in the past, the candidate of the President to judge the Supreme Court has raised many contradictions.
In this case, the candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
Name would be a hundred for the Democratics
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to be brought into the Laar of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming mid-elections of the Congress.
It would raise the vote among young people and women, who are more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term profit for the Republicans.
The occasion will not be hit for every presidential period, as the judges of the Supreme Court in the United States will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70-80 years of age.
Even some of the Republicans hesitate to name
The candidates of the Supreme Court of the United States are normally subject to a background review, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set up a week's deadline for the FBI's further investigation, Aaltola may still bring up something essential.
Yeah, it might be.
rarely there's smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness to the office will be discussed vigorously before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two Republican producers are considered to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the appointment should be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
The woman identified the Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has told BBC that she has identified Salisbury's poisoning as an agent for Russian military intelligence.
According to the photographs, the woman said it was a military intel on Anatoli Tshepiga, who worked in the GRU.
The Net Society Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they exposed one of the suspected men to Chepiga.
Already earlier they said they found evidence that the current identity of men is covert.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border of Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman in the village recognized the pictures published by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the pictures of the British police, where a man who called himself Ruslan Boshiro today appeared.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent, Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Novitshok, nerve poisoning in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, with the reputation of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the GRU connection of the suspect.
The men suspected of poisoning said that they were tourists in Salisbury at the Russian TV interview earlier in September.
Old people throwing bags in war reform
There is now a living example of what the change limit for the reform of the Soviet reform defined by the Sipila Government in practice means.
My Syntymy Valala war services produce the municipality of Oulunkaar, the former Regional Director of Attendo, who was elected as the head of health services in 2016.
The Heads of the Municipality shall warn the Board of Governors about the change limiter.
If the war costs are now rising, the municipal aid will be cut in the future.
The central heads of the municipality are terrified, and most of them are prepared for a major structural change in the care of old people, which would end the institutional care of the health centre bed department and a small unit of memory disease.
The treatment of home sickness would be increased, which means the long distances in the Vaala that older people living in the outskirts are stripped from the roots of the health centre to be treated with the "home".
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay it to customers.
The left side of the election did not undermine the poor preparation, but organised a good public meeting with many family, closest spouses, and also with other parties.
I presented the Sote County Preparatory Work on how old people are already being treated in the Vaala municipality at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Western councilman was also involved.
The local magazine made a big story about the opportunity, and it lifted Oulunkaare's manufacturers on its back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any papers the fact that Attendo has built a new nursing home in the Vala, which is now waiting for people who are empty.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service banknotes, but do not tell what level of treatment Attendo will receive or with what staff structure will treat old people up to congestion.
Without a nurse?
The locations of the health centre will be terminated because there is no medical oversight.
Attendo will also be relied on the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the election shows how central officials are running the authorised inadequate information and the authorised will be given back against the wall by means of a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party emptys the people of Valal, for who will remain safely there to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one electoral clause in the centre that the whole country was kept inhabited?
Turkey's President Erdogan opened a big mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne, Germany, thousands of people showed their view when the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened the biggest mosque of Europe.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the Rhine Beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the demonstrators' signs, and the attack sentences condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, a number of demonstrations have been organised, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to take up the human rights situation in Turkey in advance.
Erdogan's supporters were also gathered near the big mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan commended the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it confirmed relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met the federal Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel sworn to rebuild the relations of countries that have deteriorated considerably since the 2016 repression attempt in Turkey.
Mr Merkel stressed, however, that there were deep differences between countries, including human rights issues.
Review surrounded by visitation
Both the Mayor of Köln Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Armin Laschet, renounced their participation in the openings when the evaluation of Erdogan’s visit was accelerated.
The 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he came to the protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and undermined.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of the German journey of Erdogan in Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three prosecutions for the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been prosecuted for the murder of journalist Jan Kucia.
The prosecutor told me on Friday that three people are being accused of the pearly murder of Kuciak and this fiancée and other crimes.
Previously on this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murders are related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kucia has raised concern about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
The distribution of the cattle may be problematic on Sunday in the shark areas
Due to the error of the print, the Sunday Karjalainen must also be posted without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in areas of dispersion where distribution to joint boxes is required from the outer memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post will put extra press bouquets in the county.
Other Finnish subscribers’ magazines will be sent separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is profoundly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing directly today in his future debate programme, including Vesa Heilalala.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about his coming space trip, which he reserved for Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was required to pay a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been delayed one year.
Now it seems that after the experimental flight, which was unhappy, in 2014, and the death victim, things are going to be unhappy.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or at the latest in the next year.
The number of water flights is 300, i.e. his journey is about one year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut reports about its future homepage.
At the same address, he also looks at his longing for space.
When I was a child, I read a comic booklet called Space Travel, and I saw a Star Trek series on television.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's the idea...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued its lossless journey in Valioliga when it fell on Saturday at its homefield with Brighton paintings 2-0.
The power of the Championship in the sixth season is the guaranteed goal injections of Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct the fourth hit of the season from close to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the back of Brighton's goal 30 minutes.
Agüero lifted his own stock to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling to pieces with 65th game minutes.
The Argentinean was able to place the 2-0-lengths on the spot of the punishment ease.
Six winners and one game of the season started by City leads Valioliga 19 points by catches.
However, the less-played Liverpool chases only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his own seventh round in Chelsea.
Youth clubs chose new leaders in Joensuu
At its Sunday meeting, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected president from Upper Savo and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
40 actual members and 40 alternates were elected by the Board, Finland's Youth Associations are announced on Sunday.
The youth congregation meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society, organised in Joensue, therefore, gives three promises in its three-year policy objectives: we will keep the doors open to everyone, and we will organise equal recreational activities regardless of the habitat and background, and we support volunteering and people in their own growth paths, Finland’s Youth Societys will report when they are informed.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "To go a very important driver"
The Swiss newspaper Blick interview asked Mersu's British Kit, he believes that the release of Kim Räikköse from Ferrar would help Hamilton in the end of the year.
Hamilton leads the second driver of Ferrar at the MM points at 40 points Sebastian Vetti.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't think Räikkönen would hit gloves in the dish.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorite drivers and I'm convinced Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his foreheads.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played F1 at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kim, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian competition.
To the race at 14 p.m., Mercedes' Valter Bottas will go.
The evening magazine's following the race for the moment.
The Championship of the SM series of Football A became a full fart: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13 a.m., the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: the FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to get a point against the Left IFK.
In order to turn the situation on the last round, Ilves, secondly in the championship campaign, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the lattes.
However, the Gulf Championship was established practically before the beginning of the booklet, since Vasa IFK had arrived in the Gulf with only seven players.
If there had been one less, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the ladders led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Balkans' game roof is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-SM series, the P20 series, and the second block of men.
The left IFK has played in the second in practice against the fall of the entire season.
On Saturday, on the second round, the Left IFK has to win the JBK guest match and hope that Tampere United will lose its own visitor match against KuFua in the Silill Lake Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof of Eno, according to the rescue department, the luck was involved.
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up in the street of Eno on Sunday at 9:00 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department reported.
Good luck with that. The press release says it.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet after the rain.
There was a police patrol on the scene of an accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways of inquiry: equipment purchases and recruitments already made, non-sweeting operations for foreign planning
According to Antti Pelttar, Supo's commander, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As the law of intelligence enters into force, a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million should be made to the budget of supo.
In the offices of the Helsinki Ratakadu Defence Police (supon), a complete decision is already being prepared for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Pelttari, Supo's council manager, tells the West Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams is shaking on a video where he's singing in the topless... campaigning for chest cancer.
Serena Williams, the Tennis Superstar, will strike again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of the chest, by publishing his Instagram account a video where he sings only hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
Paragraph is Australian The Divinyls 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports Australian breast cancer.
"I voted the Divinyls global hit to remind women to carry out regular self-acting [breeds] audits," Williams writes the Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the skin colors around the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it plays a lot of lives.
The second writer of the Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us a hell of a song to remind the women to give priority to his health," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for the courage.

Chinese restaurants in mountains are not suitable for high-speed
In addition to traditional Chinese deliciouss, restaurants offer great landscapes.
The province of Zhejiang in China has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally located in the tongue of the rock.
It's where you can look at the woods that spread down there.
The high places make restaurant guests feel their own life in the mountains of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of peach trees.
Ravintola opened to travellers 19.9.2018.
The Youtube commands wonder where the bathroom is located.
Walking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, they tell you.
The alley ends today: this ends all
Everything good ends in good time.
Today, that is what happens to the domestic landscape drama, which has been quite respected.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week, the episode looked at 722 000 Finns as a first presentation on television.
The top figures are no longer practical, because the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkise series are not going on.
In the final period with regard to Jaska and Mirku, the aim is to move forward, and I think the mother of Jaska is the first to know what to come.

The police are also in a position to be suspicious about a man.
But none of you know how to figure out the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita's got to hear some amazing news.

Do you think you should go to work tomorrow in a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of lots of lots stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go intofecting, because the disease can be contagious even if their symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the swings.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says Prevention publication.
So it's worth staying home?
Prevention says that flu is infected even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected by a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can get back to work when the cough is slowing down and there's no more fever, says professor of medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
It's too fast to get back to the gym to slow down recovery.
Remember to wash your hands, get them on your knitchen, and throw them in the garbage.
As a matter of fact, when you're sick?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The affairs are also limited to the mask.
Then how can the infections be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

Even if we have to live separately, we have good trust and the good part of the distance is that it will remain up to the whole time, Alina reluctant in May.

However, the long-standing overcapacity of the earth and climate change are threatening to jeopardise the stone foot of this market economy.

Older men have already gotten out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person who is able to find out how much part of the stabbing is possible.
The police are also looking for another suspect in the event.
These events are being investigated as a attempt to kill and as a serious assassination.

Now they are transferred by bus to Tampere, told Jari Nieminen, specialist chief, to STT at one o'clock at the night.
The violin port was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.

According to the rescue facility, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently, the ship doesn't bleed.

Ex-managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius.
The fight against Erkan Teper, the boxer Robert Helenius's evening, is a shadow of the financial conflict.
Night-Sanomat today informed the boxing manager Jaakko Helmis and Vice-Chairman Jussi Kokkila of the challenge application, where the total amount of manager fees paid for over 80 000 euros is collected from Helenius.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to reconcile, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent the evening magazine in exchange for the events of the boxer's view.
Helenius denys that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
In response, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in an economically indispensable situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to organise him with matches and sponsor income.
In a word, it was agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay only a percentage of its matches.
Once again, it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay for anything but to receive the income they arranged for.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The work has never been agreed and this would have been insane in Helenius' situation, so Sundman will find out in the message he has prepared.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to its response, Helenius would have wanted to settle the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman had only received the draft early at the end of 2014.
On his own behalf, he pointed out the proposal and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helm.
Helenius never fought with Kokkila and Helm.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "unidentified but massive" bill from the manager's work.
This year, the same arguments have been raised.
Helenius thinks that afterwards of Helmin and Kokkila's activities are poor, and the answer is said.
Helenius meets today at the seventh of the IBF heavy-series challenger list of Erkan Teper in Stuttgart.
A Heart Man and a Good Supplyer
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt a deadly radio runner and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line of radio runner and supplier Erkki Pälli died at 83 years of age with unrepentant liver cancer.
The host's death declaration was published in the Helsinki News on Sunday.
The report says Päll died on September 3rd.
Pälli reported serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, which was mourned by the knowledge of the familiar’s fate.
Ile Vainio says he left it on Facebook before he said goodbye.
Persecution considers Erkki Pälli as a multi-sponsored expert, who became a brilliant journalist.
He recalls that Päll was a kept person with fast hoksotts and fun stuff.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy, when I first went to Finn's album when I was 12 years old, and I started there as a warehouse man.
That's when we met with Erk.
Ile Vainio remembers that when he was a Finnlevy reporter, and he was in a different position.
When I proceeded to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor in all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got to the skin of his interviews.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
Many of him were known as a highly respected radio runner, but he also wrote brilliant magazine stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was good at talking, the vainio says.
During the decade, Pälli worked in addition to the supplier's work in Fazer's disc company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work where he had a custom style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became acquainted with numerous listeners at Yle Eeter.
The Pälli retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Skiing Union announced that the financial year ended by the Union in May resulted in some EUR 450 000 profits.

Managing Director Mika Kulmala commends rapid reaction and strict economic discipline.
We reacted to the situation as soon as possible last autumn, taking adaptation measures.
Operating careful planning and economic management has been struck through our entire organisation, the corner of the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement, and in addition, the return on world cubes was the maximum in the past period of competition.
However, the cost management must also continue to be precise and at the same time we must continue looking for new financial models.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and started to be a homemade in Finland - remembered the idea of the cartoon: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The monastery left my husband's revelation in which he proposed it to the story I have developed, reports the espoolan cartoon blogger, the mother of the home and the former EU translator, Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that he was in Brussels as an EU translator for economic and legal matters until after the fourth child, the family became a returner ten years ago.
I've been very enjoyable as a homemade.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point, it came to mind what he would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then 2014 came a cartoon.
Piippo says he never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix since he was a little.
When I was a child, I had drawn, but when these manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made some dozen scripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skillful drawer, but I couldn't attract her until the summer of 2016, when I donated Vivia with a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells me that the drawing plate was a great incentive to him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to draw a paper, tell you Piippo about drawing his relationship, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts keep pops into mind, but I don't usually make the preparation at once.
One of the three screen stripes will take even more hours.
I might make a screen at once, and I'm happy to play with the colors.
Start drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the modern series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The natural man is a carrot mother with a salad hair softness that has been rugged into the L themes.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of the wild beast, man is what he eats.
The ideas of a series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a compulsive ball, even though Luomuhuppa invades it.
The Piippo tells us that he's reading his series with his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon that you're drawing, and you find out that this is what I've done today.
And there's a lot of challenges for my mom!

In Indonesia's earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old airline leader, has become a hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung stayed alone in the flight control tower until hundreds of passengers were safely escorted from the groundquake on the island.
The young man was in charge of the City of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport when the earthquake hit on Friday.
When others fled from the flight tower, Agung refused to leave its place before being controlled from the airline of Batik Air’s passenger machine.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, and the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after earthquake.
The airline tower sparkled and broke.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he was severely injured.
Agung was banished to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported to a better equipped facility with a helicopter, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the air traffic manager told the Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to increase when the flight came into the air, and its strength was finally measured by 7.5 magnets.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn considered the end of Europe in the trade war: "We should look at the next twit"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Olli Rehn, President-in-Office, said at Yle's first check that, although the tension in the tension has no direct impact on the European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which, in turn, reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is so far very good for leisure.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and has contributed to restoring the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be floating into the legs of the trade war.
We'll have to look at the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said at the interview with Yle.
There are also own risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Last night, the market reacted vigorously to a clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the population's production.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan ratio is problem credits and the unorganized loans account for more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public finances are in weaknesses, and the country appears to be reaffirming its commitment in relation to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises yet, and Rehn answered when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn was hoping it would be settled.
A sufficient distinction would have a much more negative impact.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will retire after a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikase's name have been blurred in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if there are Finnish names involved, Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on this further.
HS's super-recommended Black box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black box presentations organised by the Helsingin Sanoms will continue again in the starting week.
The other presentations will be presented at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.

There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere presentation has been sold out.
Tickets will sell the flag.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will tell a long story they have prepared, which has not previously been published in any of the HS instruments.
There's another thing that no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the world and a story about a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the manufacturers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the editors and photographers of the HS and to continue the debate.
The Sanomat of Helsinki has been organizing the evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular and often finished from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the spectator.
The black box was rewarded in the Bonnier gala for the year as a journalist act.
The rewarders thanked for a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come near their readers.
In the spring season 2019, the black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The presentation also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has different content than in the autumn evenings.
The missing mushroomer was found because of "an unprecedented experiment"
The expertise of the Finnish police drone is the top of the world: "We are asked for training"
According to the Director of the Police College, the police may use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in criminal investigations and inquiries.
On Tuesday, Oulun police managed to find the missing fungi drone in Rahahe only within a few minutes.
Principal Kimo Himberg of the Police University said that, among other things, "with unconscious experimentation and effective training, we are the top of the world here too".
Drone's quite new, and even more new in police duties.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in that, Himberg says.
It would be a hell of a storm of visitors to see the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more common.
Himberg reminds us that finding missing in Finnish winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As it has been said, in the case of Raahe, the deceased was found with the drone in only a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're meant to be trained more.
There is already a lot of use of drone for police tasks, and their use is becoming common and growing in the future.
That's what I dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, according to Himberg, for example, in the case of an accidental or crime scene investigations and in some forms of inquiry.
For example, we need to check out some area a little further, where there may be fears that violence is being encountered.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby rose to the first divergent.
Karelian Rugby party in Kuopia on Saturday, two-division victory.
The Joensuus were still in the middle of the match with 7-12 losses to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second episode they found a plan and whispered the guests of the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelia Rugby had a historic rise in his 1-division.
The club has played in the first place, but then the Finnish Rugby serial activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and its multisectoral 1-division.
The Society intends to accept the serial scene, but it will know a great job next winter.
The current stash of less than 20 players must be raised to 25.
1.Division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the acquisition of funds must also comply with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the main coach
On the Twitter account, the Montreal Canadiens chief coach, who plays in the Ice Hockey NHL, confirmed the association with the Twitter account that the Finnish stunt Jesperi Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super promise for Kotkaniemen, 18, on the first round of the three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal’s rehearsal strength from the end of summer and has presented strong picks in September’s training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to make a goal in his first training match.
Principal Coach Julien complimented the Finn to take large development asses after his arrival to the camp.
The NHL frame series begins next week in the night against Thursday, Finland's time.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening round.
What's a good leader?
This week there has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland.
In the interview with the HS, President Risto Siilasmaa, the Nokia Government, an optimist of Paranoid, in which he enlightens leadership in his philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollia.
Ollila strongly disputed the accusations, but even the previous Nokia reports have mentioned the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and nonsense, which caused the collapse of mobile traffic.
The risk-taking and agitation of the company's elevation phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, Nordic Business Forum also organized a huge business event, which attracted the Finnish business cream to the Fair Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world rose up to the stage.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
The legend of the guide guides Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are most mentally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the whole foods chain known as a wide variety of organics, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can not be simply the purpose of making profits to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the success book, told me that the most successful leaders are researchedly humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodar of the financial sector reminded me that the characteristics of a good leader should be one of the stages of the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature phased company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
At the Nordic Business Forum, 7 500 visitors listened to these lessons - mostly Finnish leaders.
When they were at risk, they had information.
A lot is required from a good leader.
That is why leadership is so often misleading, including at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the cliffs.
However, they doubted whether they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to assess outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrived in a brilliant red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the missionary in a beautiful black dress.
The 2012 Miss in the Finnish dress was also the pizza lat.
A little poden jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, and Chafak tells me what he's doing.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles.
He's done ads, among other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, and also as in Finland.
Although he says that work must be done harder, because the model is always a substitute.
I've got to punch harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found the great Volvo in the operation: "We can't tell you what"
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the Juditerrauma and the Great-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry transport from the Själlan Island was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police searched for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the Deputy Head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We found the car we found.
We can't tell you yet where the car was found, Henrik Storm on the report from the Copenhagen police will tell you about Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo you're looking for has no direct contact with the threat.
He said the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told me about the police press conference on Saturday.
Inspector Jørgen Bergen Skov was in the middle of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell you what criminal code he was looking at.
But Skov said it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the STT states that there is no longer any concern for the public as a threat to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of divergence now the people are voting on the matter in controversial elections.
The proposal for a new name of the country is currently being voted in Macedonia in the Balkans.
According to the Agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the North Macedonian Republic would be named.
Greece has so far blocked the efforts of Macedonia to become a NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern county.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports the membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
The vote began at least at a school in the centre of Skopje in the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse, called for support for the agreement.
The referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has been campaigning for the adoption of the agreement.
The National Opposition of Rights, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a referendum to be boikotoed.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to stress whether the volume of vote increases by more than 50 %.
The referendum is not binding, but the profit of yes would allow the mandate to amend the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The voting sites will be closed from 8:00 at the time of Finland.
That's a handsome victory!

Canada fights the time to reach the agreement with the United States of Nafta
Time threatens to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement in Nafta.
The United States has set the back limit on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have debated closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
On President Donald Trump's demand, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement for Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but Canada has not yet reached agreement.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force the agreement before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador enter into office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.

Students act as a rare delicious: an ancient tragedy - aggravated Oresteia affects their visuality
Ancient tragedy is rarely delicious in Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought to the National Theatre tour the only whole of an ancient play trilogy, Orestheia of Aiskhylos.
In the Lavat Open! projects that started in 2015, the theatre High School's actor students work internationally with a professional instructor.
This fourth project, as was the first, is the director of Mikko Roiha, a resident in Berlin.
His international premiere night, Oresteia was awarded in Berlin in April.
The reconciliation of Roiha from Orestheia summarises the report of the end of the family of the destroyed Atreus and of the birth of the rule of law for 20 minutes, particularly by compiling the choirs.
The work will succeed in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon, a great Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theater’s pages are highlighted by a mere and bright stage thinking.
Its centre is interchangeable with the dynamics between the performers who leave the choir, who play the name roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double-and-three seats for name roles.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returned from the Troyan war, and this battle Hall, Kassandra are shown on the scene, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the presentation does not highlight being loyal to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, which is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in raising up a group of adventurous actor students, directly as a single organism, a group of rhythms.
In particular, in the choir sections, very expressive, sculpture-like group designs, actors who tend to be able to access their rights on the ground, only by decorating the white front line, on the stage.
Impressive.
Orestheia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer prepares his first hydrogen loader

We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanking network, in Cheol Lee, Deputy Managing Director of Hyundai Motor, said the agreement in the field of publicity.
The fists were hanging on several occasions in Kajaan.
A little over thirty - year - old man assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal.
In the outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when a third man got involved, the assassin hit him.
The police caught the assassin.
At the police station, the man was still aggressive and kicked another policeman.
He also threatened the police by assassination and killing.
He was taken into prison to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three assaults and as a violent opposition of the official.
In the middle street of Kajaan, another assault occurred on Saturday morning night.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kayan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down, and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assassins away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the authors had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking the witnesses to contact Kajani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigate.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio runner Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term supplier, died of cancer when he was 83 years old.
Radio runner Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unparalleled liver cancer, reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, we're on our way.
Even the doctor has said it, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of trade ads and sediments must be ensured
For the first time, I was hired in 1984.
When these tyres make some topic surprising, it is usually about the big news.
When I wrote (Caryan, 27.9.) about the safety of retail workers, I was amazed and even a bit angry.
I also talked to the matter about the Working Environment Expert Erika Kähärä.
He says criminal statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of the cases which have been clearly serious, and many of the real violence situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to statistically close their situation on the basis of the Working Safety Act, but these statistics remain available in the internal context and do not collect their data anywhere", he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
The problem of violence has always been that they do not always have physical injuries.
However, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the difference between the situation of violence and the situation of violence that threatens, when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access to it.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even though there is no real act.
Some areas of residence are unrest.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours were released, the media also had a rather high steaming effect on the safety of sellers.
"In that time, many employers arranged security services for at least nighttime hours and to prevent working alone", Kähähähärä commented.
If nothing happens, we'll make the wrong conclusion.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
In view of the security, when the disturbances remained well under control, the idea was that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
A mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who had been assaulted does not want to make an inquiry on a criminal who usually lives near the trade.
However, according to the same paragraph of the law laid down in 2011, a mild assault will become subject to the prosecution if it takes place at work.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time the trade aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should be investigated and accused by the prosecutor.
When the court puts a few assaults in prison, and the judgment from the tough end of the punishment scale would be cleaned up.
The society, where food stores must be open to small municipalities for almost nights, must ensure the safety of workers in the market.
Heidi Sohlberg signed the Miss before the start of the direct shipment - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
It is not the traditional way to see Miss chubby this year on TV, but the broadcast is shown on Viafree website.
The shipment is hosted by former Miss Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplayn NHL and KHL Studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are the driver of Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the host triangle told the visitors and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula the brutal applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this one of our men's drinkers, Sohlberg sparked his colleagues in the hurrage of the audience.
The front races are followed by many of the previous years, Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to them and sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iro's married!
Sohlberg was blocking towards Saros.
The more Sohlberg was referring to the just divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
The Sieppi spoke for the first time in the Ilta-Sanations journal.
Missikaunotar told me that he did not want to open the reasons for the difference in the public, because it is between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't busy with a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and in particular, I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The status of Harjula’s marriage came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally failed to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The clerk three laughed at me.
I was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed a mistake.
The Northman tortured his tied up by sliting, burning, and feeding a powerful sauce
The Northwest Court of Justice has condemned a man of the age of 34 who lived in Kokkola for a period of three years in prison for several offences committed by his open-ended spouses.
The instrument of committing crime was, among other things, the belt, the cable and the cables.
The court condemned these items to be lost to the State.
The accusation of a suspect was a serious rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected.
Four assaults, gross assaults, forced forced, illegal threats, violations of freedom, gross freedom violations, and two acts of harm.
Crimes occurred between the 26th of March last and the 24th of May.
At the end of the last actions, the man was captured and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday of the last week, Northwest was sentenced and ordered a 34 - year - old person to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two gross freedom violations and the gross rape that took place on 22 May.
However, these accusations were rejected by the court as unprecedented.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the circumstantial judge issued a public report on the judgment.
According to the circumstantial judge, the accused had been subject to violence, threats, and forced in situations where this had been committed.
The defendant sliced his victim with a knife, burned a cigarette, fed a potent sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
With its judgment, the court ordered the State to be lost criminal instruments: the belt and cable, the ties, the bathing jacket belt, the knife and the vest.
Four Witnesses
According to the court of law, the parties continued to live together between acts.
It is noted in the resolution that a large part of the most serious actions took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim's 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary disadvantages of EUR 5800.
He hardly has that money, because he has already had debts in his possession.
Prison is not the man's first.
The evening magazine doesn't mention a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case when you write this.

A Philippines inventor flying a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Philippines inventor, a hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group in the world who swears he's invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to the reports from the world, a man has used a large proportion of his property to build his dream.
Six years ago, he started the development of his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he's done the first successful test flight... he's flagged on his device over seven feet.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device raises positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.

In public and well-being sectors, overtime and shift bans start tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and in children’s day care, will be assessed by the President of the JHL Day Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone's going to have to think about how to get their children.
The employer's task is now to ensure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when the members of JHL were banned from overtime and shift due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff has not been hired, but that workers have left overtime or have switched shifts.
This isn't a work fight yet.
It is a normal standard for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only to do them.
JHL objects to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of redundancies for small companies.
Mr Markku Jalonen, the Director of the Labour Market for Municipal Employers, is not going to be able to assess the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very transformative, even though services can be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what can be done.
The region is so wide, so difficult to say, social and health, and the technical sector.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employers, and Jalonen said to STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week, experience has already been gained, among other things, from the three-day activities of the Association of Neighbourhood and Fundamentals, Super and the Social and Health Trade Organisation.
Their effects were rather limited.
The prohibition of overtime and shift is governed by workers in the municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
At this stage, the fight is about 100 000 members of JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may last for a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other work fighting activities if the drafting of the dismissal Act continues.
Now, the government should admit that it's running into the wall and hard.
Mr. Jelosen believes that both the ay movement and the government must come up against it.
It's special that the hard ones are already on the beep, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen will update it.
The great coral ritual is born in the fitness circles of children and adults, studying the gestures of crustaceans and sea horses.
In the other premises, the Great Coralality received its first night last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coralition is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
However, this time a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallise the findings of the initial practice.
In the theater games, there is plenty of saddle magic for children's participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase.
However, large coral ritualism is not a child performance, but a performance performed by adults and children in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations of children's way of receiving information and making art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint cuts also slides the distance between adults and children.
The great coral ritual resembles some satubaletic, fitness circles and nature-related information attacks, but ultimately it comes around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The great coral ritual begins with access to the business lines of the corals and the coral rituals and of the living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness circles teach inter alia the gestures of crustaceans and sea horses.
Finally, a little hour long show is made where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes help us get to know the life of the coral rive.
In the Great Corally Riuta there are both diving people who observe the coral crawl of life and the corals that are examined.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
The sights and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and faint.
Whether the landscape of an organism, the organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism, and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem that hard.
In other premises, the group is trying to pursue the limit of thinking and action to which access when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more important.
After a workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitrator for the endangered corals.
It should not be allowed to harden the destruction of man’s understanding, even though it could be difficult to understand the importance of exercising his own sympathy in the face of destructive prospects.
In other premises, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life with a political gesture.
There are other generations, other types of consciousness, other species, and future generations of generations, whose wonders and plays it clean up.
Children grow up too fast. I'm glad there were no smartphones when I was a kid.
Today, children and young people are increasingly responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking while you are younger and younger.
I think that children should be children all the time of their childhood, and not mess with their lives for drug and sex, because others say that they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in the fifth grade at the "boyfriend" weekend.
When she came to pick up her humiliated sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned about it all along our childhood, that we should not touch dope and sex is a adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a proper childhood, and they do not need to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing in Instagram the younger girls who are wearing makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send images to reveal at night.
It's harder for girls to know how old they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was about playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: Authorities told the Government that the Airisto Pearl case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva's interview, the defence police and defence forces visited to inform the defence and foreign committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that the Airiston Helme investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, news by Yle.
Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee, confirmed the information of the sources which were nominated.
According to the Canary, the defence and defence police took part this week in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Commissions to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily regarded as economic crime.
They were very tight that they did not speculate that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented on the Yle interview.
According to the above information, no evidence has been found in the confiscated material to date on the link to national security, but the investigation is only underway.
There is no way yet to know what can be revealed from there, one of the people who interviewed Yle finds.
A week ago, large home searches in Turku's island and continent have raised the question of whether it is a matter of economic crime or of a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening newspaper compiled a case that is being conducted on both sides and against the arguments.
Video: the dream painting saved the lost series of Liverpool
Liverpool's 100-protective start was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the team 1-1 on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be the same year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped the 1-0 guest victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Valioliga signal that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûrgen Klopp, arrived with the same idea in Western London.
The Reds had started with six consecutive wins of Valioliiga.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone in his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had under Wednesday's fine liquor pickup from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the beginning.
For 25 minutes, he first balled in a small state with a triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard exploding and sent him a fully weighted pass feed.
Hazard fell a bit on the edge of the punishment area, but he bombed a perfect left foot bet in the back of the bottom of the bet.
The pool's brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight, and he couldn't just get his finger head into the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss station lightly unjustly because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger put Mo Salah's guidance on the goal line.
In the second episode, the Chelsea Vessel Kepa also got into real action.
The Basque guard reacted rapidly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the dust to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson threw zero in his way through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino at the center.
However, the Brassistar's bucket was heading towards the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership.
That didn't last for the 89th minute when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league started with 1 1, but it's still in the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also very closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer debate, the pothers are deep.
I remember a decade ago, when a magazine asked various Finnish actors, which divides the Finnish people.
The answer to Juice Leskisen was the only one that remembered: Nen-supply.
Some have a nen-head and some aren't.
There's no way you're going to have divisions anywhere, and there's one offer.
Finland in the EU has achieved the abandonment of the annual clock transplant.
Many agree that clock transplantation twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide which time will end at the end of the current summer or winter or some other time zone.
This is also a way for the people to say their opinions on the.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is intensely held on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
With the impact of the morning light on the wellbeing of the people and the summer time, those defending the impact of evening light on people's outdoor desire and thus on welfare.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to the studies, morning light causes a rash of human day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives you more opportunities, for example, for the autumn yards.
The number of extra lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I'd rather take both of them, but badly, we can't do anything in the north collar of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers are too light for many anyway.
A typical debate on the subject is to drive our own view, and the second is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the counterparty are not much listened, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn another head.
It's burning up the squares to waste.
The subject is very easy to argue, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and it is sufficient to justify a mutual feeling.
As a general rule, it is the most steep and fruitless issue.
Well, it'll be a shame if the wrong choice becomes chosen, but you'll fit it too.
And it always offers a suitable sinshoe if life feels underground.
Josba fought the odds of the odds.
Josba's first guest game at the Salibandy Divar produced Nurmon Jymy against the full three serial points.
Josba left the Seinäjoki on his way home with a cheerful victory of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo was still on the goal at the beginning of the third set, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Front and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted on the 6-5 winning paintings.
In both teams, critical minutes were played on the balance.
The most effective Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowered anyway when the Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenki (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of its goal.
After three series rounds, Josba has six points.
Next time, O2-Jyväskylä will come to visit us in two weeks.
In the church of Eno on Sunday, the 200th anniversary party
The 200th anniversary of the Enon Church will be celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
The burning of the church in the excitement danger a week ago was a shock.
My uncle's church was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party place today.
Even if no one wants to, the church of Enon is now the oldest church in Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always had Eno's heart despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The family fair starts at Eno church today at 10:00.
Then we will move to the church house at the cattle’s table.
The program has all kinds of things inside and out all day.
For example, you can learn from the church building with the guidance of the retired, 37 - year - old minister Ari Räsäs.
The Church's birthday also means the end of one era.
The church house already decommissioned in 1982 will open its doors today for the last time.
Now we're in a creekhouse in the former colonial house, says Kappalainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed inner air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk is out of the chair of the Tesla Government's speech, and the charges of fraud were settled at $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the CEO Elon Musk have agreed their case with the SEC of the U.S. securities market supervisor.
SEC suspected Musk had committed a securitisation, and Musk was in danger of being abandoned because of the company he set up.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to avert the chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire the president of the external government.
Musk is also subject to stricter supervision.
According to the Agreement, Teslan must hire two independent leaders and continue to monitor Musk communication more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay both $20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the disadvantages of Tesla's shareholders", says Director Steven Peikin from SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The TV took up Tesla's stock rate for a moment.
SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a securitisation.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential donors.
In practice, the Agency accused Muskia of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that Musk was to be sentenced to fines and that he was banned from acting under the management of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong downturn.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami
In Indonesia, the number of dead in the earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country’s disaster agency according to AFP.
It is believed that the number of victims of death will continue to increase, as we are in the process of exterminating the destruction.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked a town in the island of Sulawes, please.
It was immediately after the earthquake, a warning that was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least so far the Remuneration.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about Donggala's area near the center of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to be dead.
Rare requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
The President Joko Widododo, who arrived at the devastation area today, called on soldiers to continue their rescues without exhausting their days and nights.
One of the centres of rescue is the hotel in Palu, whose ruins are believed to still have 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Office, told us that one person was found alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel popularly favoured by business travellers at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, a rapid excavation of heavy scrubbers in the landing and tsunami area would be needed.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media in order to find their closest to the missing people.
Help me, you in the Remuneration and nearby.
My friend's family still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Political phone numbers leaked into the hands of disturbing people in Britain
Many British politicians were disrupted when their contact information leaked out because of the defects in the application encrypted.
The disruptions were accessed, among other things, to ministers' phone numbers.
This was an application used at the British Conservative Party meeting in the government.
For example, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, were confronted.
There were a number of representatives of the European Union.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public has access to profiles using a politician’s e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who entered the profile was able to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson into a profile picture of a porn photo and a title for an offensive.
Michael Goven's profile photo was switched to the mediamogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian Colomnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows access to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then you can view the profile person's contact details and send messages on this name.
The application of the meeting made the public criticism of each supplier, politician and participant’s telephone number, Foster.
The Conservative Party reporter apologized for the data leakage.
He said that technical problems have been solved and that the application now works safely.
The British Information Authority ICO supports data leakage.
The application was made by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the Opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland audience has a large number of penetration Polish people every week
Observed viewers paid attention to the reaction of the studio audience of the The Wall Finland programme.
The U.S. format, which was rapidly spread in the world, ran the Finnish version to Four last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's host game show is described in Poland in the same studio as other international productions in the format.
In the Polish studio, the description opportunities were exceptional, as the large 12 metres high in the format required space from the farm.
During the opening period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the programme, which was conceived as Polish.
In Twitter, there was a debate on whether the Polish might understand anything about the game to be played as Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, chief of four domestic programs, illustrates the issue for the evening magazine.
He says that there are close players in the studio audience, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international assaults in Finnish production, as are the audiences of the The Wall periods described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such people, so-called professional audiences, who are in various programmes, backs up the fingers.
He reminds me that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language with which it is played.
The red and green balls that fall from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for the foreign language who carry out the translation work.
There are two translators to interpret the events of the studio director as a simulant emblem.
And then the studio director will guide the audience and tell them what kind of laptop is thrown there for example and what is going on, Sormunen says.
He compared the situation with David Hasselhoff in domestic production recently.
David Hasselhoff was in Talent Finland a few years ago.
He had all the time a simulated burst into his ear, and he knew everything in his illustrations that was spoken as Finnish, the sum of the ring.
The southern orphan in Japan is moving towards the main island, the authorities warn the land zones and floods
The authorities also warn possible land zones and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifun Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the death victims so far.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated in shelters and electricity has been cut off by over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka for six months in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also tough winds and rains.
The train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami will torture Japan until Monday.
The Heaven of the Aces went darker and darker
It's been a bad start.
The sky blurred almost as long as the team lost on Saturday's homeground for Vaasa Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and six rounds of points are a total of two.
No Ace defender or two lower chain player has yet made the goal.
Also, pressure is growing all the time.
Sports against the audience were disregarded even at the time of almost half of the game left.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be worried, because we played that weakly.
Particularly, the presentation of the second set was shamefully bad, for Äss the power of 1+2 made Jarno Kärki.
Of course, it tasted a sport's victory.
The team had a game underneath Friday, so I thought it might have seen doing it.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Goodrinen, is wondering the number of events at a large hall.
Somehow, he thought that maybe this year there would not be so many people, Mr. Goodrinen, to think about this morning.
In autumn 2017, together with the Leipoon Day, the SM contests of the Tractor Fingering were held simultaneously, so perhaps the expectations would suggest that the audience could even decrease a little from the previous year.
On the other hand, however, the corridors were backed up quickly before ten, the sellers said the products were out, the news drum was sold more than nearly 500 doses, and even the number of cars Goodrine heard was rising.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, and Jórinen will tell you later in the afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, five hours were particularly suitable for children’s families, which must have attracted them to the record.
In addition, Hearinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also go to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, rapporteurs, salesmen of conceptual, bakery and harvesting products had arrived at almost 100 leisure operators.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Goodrinen, attracted the audience from the hall view.
A harvest was blessed at the beginning of the bread day.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won a public vote.
11 different forms of bread came to the children's bread contest.
Marjatta Vepsälainen, the winner of the rustic bread contest, spent the day in the pie of the martyrs.
7 x the most beautiful light... here you recognize a good light.
Wake up the condition, create the right atmosphere for decoration and read the book without tired eyes.
Good lighting is worth sazzing.
We gathered three good reasons to bet on the light.
The tips were given by Innolux's sales and marketing director, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do me a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more ages are behind.
Sufficient light can help with problems that come to many with age when the visual accuracy decreases and aggravates more and more.
In the past, the need for light increases.
A 60-year-old needs a light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Thus, it is worth sausing for health reasons for the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
A good lighter gives enough light, but does not shak, Jokiniemi tip.
Create Beauty around you
Beautiful decoration can only be revealed with correct lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
The popularity is a Japanese style that combines gestureless, Scandinavian and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, modern and playing retrotyl with strong colours, with different metal tones or ice creams from the '70s have risen up to the bum.
The authenticity fascinates the same way as the home in other decorations.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more will be invested in the home than before, and the decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to be tailored to their own home, a bold lighter with a story to be told.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products, whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-intelligent, Jokiniemi says.
Domestic is not necessarily the latest trend lighter, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewelry and elegant classics keep their feet one year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and see you!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian catererer after three games
Coco and the attacker, Brendan O'Donnell's roads are breaking up.
The Canadian stunt played a total of three league games without power points in the orange black, KooKoo explains in its communication.
O'Donnell moved to Kokoo in August with a one-year agreement, which included a test period lasting until the end of September.
During the last year, the 26-year-old assault played in the KHL in the Red Star lines of Kunlund and the KHL farm in VHL, RS Heilongjiang.
There's no information yet on the new company of O'Donnell.
The player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic switched to paper.
The game specialty game player now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the Kivifoot store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
The products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages coming from importers.
All the packages that come to us are going to be used again.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in the state that it can be used, Ville Puurula of Oulu tells us about the gameman.
As softening material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
They're avoiding the rubber as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move in envelopes to recycling material.
The business wants to set an example for others.
Turning around isn't supposed to cause any more trouble.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also be economic savings when, for example, cardboard packages are reused.
Circumvention is suitable for the gameman's activities, as along with new products, the key product selection of the movement includes the games and equipment used.
Each fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in every costume
Classic clothes work from age to age in a costume.
They create the basis of a good garderobi with their multi-use, as it is easy to collect different costumes around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most classics used in the wardrobe are quality stitches.
This category also includes a black pool.
Black knit made of natural material on pool crochets can not be a mistake.
The clothing can be combined with both straight pants, boring beans and jeans, and it can be surrounded by both a restrained outfit and a blurred style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic fine-tuned style artist.
I saw you create a style.
Autumn trends are created in gold brown and wide-coloured spider-metal pants, black pool-oneule and grey ankles.
The classic poolonele, together with other classics, blue green scotch and wine red sauce, constitutes a feminine and refined set of costumes.
That cracks in the black poolhole by combining it with trendy garment pieces: a jean skirt, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the foreign intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or military intelligence of the GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRGs specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelna and group: sabotage and intelligence group.
In the West of the Soviet Security Service of the KGB, the agents prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports the KGB's offensive architect Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century.
The targets included ports, docks, large dams, oil processing plants and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired uniforms and costumes for coverage operations for the DRG groups for Bundeswehr, railways, garrison guards and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they were dressed in local Ukrainian police riot weapons, established inspection stations from the peninsula to the leaders of Ukraine and separated from their country of Crimea.
Cold Wartime agents hid supplies with mines, explosives, lighters and communication equipment in the sabotage groups.
In 1998 there was still a KGB's hiding place in Switzerland, which was exploded by the authorities injecting it with water tyres.
By the night, the police reached four steering drinks in the county.
The police got caught across the North Carelia four steering drinks between Friday and Saturday nights.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the Contio Bay blew 1,57 proms.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaninines at half-four o'clock night.
On the knee lake, the car crashed at four o'clock, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew up 1,54 proms.
He didn't get any serious injuries at the outlet.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old local man driving a passenger car blowing 1,33 proms in the alkmeter.
The police suspected these male drivers of serious drinking and the driver of the Knee Lake as well as of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man transporting a local van in the crossing of the Oils and Hoikante was blowing 0.52 prom.
He's being suspected of driving.
The police are asking for observations about stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to the police, a man was assaulted at the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
Dark-haired suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jacket immediately after stabbing a dark farmer, left the Railyard in the direction of the bus station.
One of the suspects left the Humaliston street in the middle of the bike.
A pedestrian died after he was frozen under a bus in Pori.
In the porch, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after the bus hit him.
After the morning quarter, the accident occurred in Raumant in the area of Soutumaa.
There's no doubt about the driver of the bus.
The police are investigating the incidents that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in rows for the end of the period, The Time of Experimental Journal has ended
Mika Toivola, director of the Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (Central) has been an important part for the team in initiatives, under-power games and the defending role of the four-field.
The Fülöp Riska, who played the first autumn, will continue in the HPK of Hämeenlinna for the rest of the period.
The success of the 33 Experienced Riska in the roles offered him was assured of the social leadership.
Philip has been an important piece to us in the initiative, in the underpower game and in the defending role of the four-field.
Even if there is still something to be improved, it is good to hold on to this experienced player, Mika Toivola, Director of Sports at HPK, commenting on the Society's press release.
According to hope, Riska's value will rise in the game of the Hockey League's solution.

Real story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man’s own experience.
The night's movie was made on the basis of them.
Everest will now have his premiere on the Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a destructive snow storm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormaker’s 2015 guidance reports about the survival struggle that has been dealt with by crops.
The tragedy has been filmed and documented before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
The world’s highest mountain took the life of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just Hall who worked as a Weathers guide.
Weathers could have saved his life before he left Nepal.
As a result of this pressure and air pressure, he lost his vision, so the summit had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on the road and didn't come back.
However, the struggle of Weathers from life and death had just begun.
When the storm got up, he got lost and found no more in the camp.
When a man was found, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
It's like a miracle store he got on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers was thought to still die, and once again he was left behind his own happiness.
Obviously, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the climbers began to believe in the possibility of helping him.
In the film, Beck Weathers is performing Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is a celebration of the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and the entire family’s feast was prepared for the holiday year.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. on Eno’s church hill, after which there was an offering of the cattle’s table at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.

Photos and videos: My medican flashed his power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane storm wandered from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medican is named Zorba.
The Greek Aviation Institute has given red weather warnings to the regions of Athika, Peloponnecus, the Ionian Islands, Kykladi and Crete.
There are plenty of floods all over Greece in the pictures taken from the region.
The video published in Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthia instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the south of Peloponnecus peninsula, the wind caused a powerful sea trip.
The Ambassador of Finland instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for weather information and local authorities to follow the instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, a medican, brings with it toughness and even a flood danger.
According to the CNN, a study published in 2011 indicates that medians occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on September-October roads when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm that is now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before going north and towards Europe.
The care in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The storm is also undermined in the summer by the ruined areas of the terrestrial areas in the Athens environment.
In Greece, the medican was also riled last November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but the flights are still scheduled in the Greek islands threatened by the storm are on holidays of thousands of Finns.
The trips to the sea are canceled and even walking should be careful not to flew on the storm.
These guidelines have been distributed to 3 500 guides in Greece through sun travels to a Finnish holiday weekend.
The instructions will be needed because even the storm of Zorbas, which is abundant to the horror readings, has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the nearest island of Crete, wind speed can rise up to 45 metres per second.
Rain rains that increase the weather's viciousness.
All travellers from Finland who have reported their phone numbers have been warned about the wind by means of a text message through solar travelers and Tuin.
In the air, however, sun and heat
According to Inka Ikose, the specialist for solar travel communications has avoided the worst in holiday destinations by the beginning of Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and rose according to normal schedules.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
We're going ahead of security.
I supported the media inspector Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also travelled on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our personnel on the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early night on Saturday.
At present, the most popular Greek islands, Rodoks and Crete, have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are holidaying in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm in the island will be reached on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodoks had mocked the sun and the temperature was at 27 degrees, says Ikonen of sun travels.
Zorbas has been estimated to move into the next Turkish prick, although a little lessened.
In this case, we have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying in Antalya Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvise and Janni Huss have completely identical evening suits in the Missifinal, so they react to the situation.
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland's final Saturday in an open evening suit.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a beautiful suit for this night, Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening suit had also been chosen by the conductor Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself noticed the same costumes and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on a plane.
The Hussi is a missile runner of the backstage and red carpet, and he talks about the most incoming front stars.
The Huss has a fresh move behind him because he moved from Kampi to Dump Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what's happening.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi's thinking.
Before he moved, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel a week without leaving anywhere.
When I got stressed out, I got a flu, but otherwise I had a really successful holiday, Hussi will tell you.
Shirly Karvise's use on the plane attracted a lot of attention to collecting the curiosity of the retired people.
The director and Miss Shirly Karvinen, 2016, told us on the red carpet of Miss Finland, she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair.
I makeup and I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home for the nightdress, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he's pulled up his makeup in the middle of the retired people.
His preparation also attracted the attention of the travellers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people look at the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least in the opinion of others.
Karvinen flys to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that she enjoyed her desk as the Finnish coach of Love Island.
He describes his experience as well as being stopping so far.
She says she's been to say hello to the singles of the show on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are human real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's singles.
How am I dressing overgeneration boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothes are clothing items that work from age to age in a costume.
Often, classics are decades old, but sometimes they can fit the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the over-generation shoes of the shoes of the fall and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to his name, the boots that cross the knee are repeatedly stylish in the year and the season.
Seeming boots share user opinions, but a brave model is worth trying, well, boldly.
In fact, the overgeneration boots actually fit for any set of costumes.
Then it's about jeans, pizzas, chills or tricos, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots is working.
Long boots look good in both the celebration cabinets and the ark costumes.
Black overgeneration shoes are well suited to blunt costumes.
They adequately balance the femaleity of a pink, flowered plyser and bleached, tiny needle.
Raikas, but autumn stylish coat for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited costume is produced from a long copper brown opalescent, top-generation boots, showing earrings and twinklet bag.
Although there is a certain refinement in the overgeneration boots, they also perfectly fit together with a relaxed t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy box.
It's so easy and still so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, Espoo city informs.
Otaniemi's robot cars play the role of the bus simulator, as next spring, it is intended to launch transport by robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year-to-year working robot vehicle transport and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The test will find out how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars are automatically driven by other transport without special transport arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always responsible for an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their environment all the time with a number of different sensors and assess whether the route is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snow sleeve, the Sensible 4 CEO, Harri Santamala, responsible for the development of robot traffic.
Robot cars travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10:15 and Thursdays at 10:15 a.m.
Robot cars stop by six stops along the way and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops identify the stop marks.
I'm sure you can get a ride from the stop in Otakaare, number 1.

Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The Itä-Suomen police department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Riistakeskus in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's bay crew reported on Saturday on social media.
The main focus of supervision was the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required in the state countries.
In addition, the authorisations for the possession of hunting weapons and the authorised volumes of self-charging weapons used for sewerage were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the inspection, and only one hunter with no required hunting permit was met.
An unauthorised fishing trap was assigned to the hunter for 12 days.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown by the police, and two of them were suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, a police procedure.
Conclusion is that hunters respect the promise of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised to control.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Itä-Suomen police department will continue hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The silence goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (Kok.) will travel to Turkey next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
In Finland, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been decided this year.
Electoral trips are usually made a few times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey in the process of interviewing.
Firstly, the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are deemed to be particularly indispensable in refugee camps, such as single care families, disabled persons and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for the coming groups in Finland than there are in the quota, because some of them are virtually not arrived for various reasons.
It also meets the non-governmental organisations on the borders of Syleyman Soylu and Syria, the Turkish Minister of Interior.
Ilkka Salmi is also on the way to the Officer of the Ministry of Interior.
Quota lifted
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a few years, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen against the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently presented a gradual increase of quotas to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
A quiet visit is the first visit during this period of government, which the Minister of Interior will place to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Ministers of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) were able to move to their new assignments before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 support from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now we're going to go to the barges... and we don't know if weeping or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen was news of a bill to change the animal protection law.
The article came to the conclusion that the draft legislation in principle prohibits the holding of all animals which are not individually authorised by ministries’ regulations as production animals, pets or otherwise business activities.
Therefore, all other animals not specifically referred to in the Regulation are fundamentally prohibited.
If the legislative proposal ends up in law, it is likely that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law separately prohibits action that jeopardises the security of society or the good way.
It is now in principle that there is a ban on all the activities to which the law or regulation does not specifically authorise.
This change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business activities and nothing else to do until the law or regulation adopted by it has been adopted.
The government's activities in law-making have generally been weak.
If we are now going to the path that, in principle, everything that is not allowed separately is prohibited in Finland, we can no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the animal protection law would require an update.
But this is not the case with democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the constitution very well, but whether it accepts such a "all things are prohibited which are not individually permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope that there will be a wise minister who will stop the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: Autumn four trendiest skirts
This autumn trend is coming in snake tissues.
It looks particularly good in the skirts.
Combine a snake-shaped skirt with the more controlled top parts, such as a pool or a normal T-shirt, so that the costume remains stylish.
This autumn there is plenty of silk, and in particular the silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothing pieces of the season.
Connect the magnificent silk skirt finely with the female upper part or relax with the knitting.
You can play with the Silk Hatch more bravely and throw into your legs, for example, the lenses or the trendy cowboy boots of the fall.
It doesn't matter if it's grey, brown or multi-thane, all the dresses of the square are now part of every woman's must have-skinned clothes.
Boldly connect different colors to each other, and play with the square tissues on the top of different tissues.
For example, a combination of diamonds and sphere holes is beautiful.
Unsymmetrical pearls are a breeze of the lightness of the summer that can be taken with them to the autumn.
The unsymmetry pearl is also female and plays and fits greatly in both the ark and the feast.

Kim Räikkönen crystalized the cause of Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrar.
Ferrarin Kim Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too tough at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to fall into the panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver evaluates.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not about anything huge.
Our car was the best in time all weekends for now, but they were just too fast, the fourth time driving, and the Mercedes velvet with their tallimate, Sebastian Vetti, clearly left from the Mercedes speed.
Ferrar had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
They asked him why the sudden fall of Mercedes was the reason.
They seem to go faster than we do, so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
During time, rare deliciousness was seen for the Sauber, the Sauber of the coming Stair of Räikköse.
Charles Leclerc, the replacement of Ferrar for the next season, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also took over the last time driving session.
For the Swedish coach, the tenth destination is the best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers left all the way out in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging in view of the future of the Horse?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early age, a step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's what Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper, "Robbe is back"
During the night of the match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper, the Stuttgart, progressed on even marks.
The German was more initiative in the ring, but he couldn't get the right hits.
Clearly more extensive, Helenius controls the match with its hard series, which were well found.
The Finn was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked up Teper on the left straight.
The hit was so hard that a concoccier, who fought before the public, did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was assured, Helenius flew quite moderately.
In a group interview, he initially praised the public’s good mood and opponent.
Then he switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you for all the audiences and the Finnish incentives.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
It might even be possible to get to the MM match, and Helenius commented on the Evening News before the fight.
Instead, the loss might have decided the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
This isn't getting any younger, Helenius, 34 years old, admitted to Teper's meeting.
The number of victims in Indonesia may be multiplied
According to the Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country urges you to prepare for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Saviors are searching for trapped and also dead in the most affected areas in the island of Sulawes: Please, the city of port and its neighbourhood in Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Pal, and the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been injured.
There are still people in the fragile buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa Pay has fallen.
The saviors tell me that they have heard the screams of the people who were trapped in the ruins, but the shortage of the harvest has delayed the beginning of the rescue.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has assigned the army to rescue and eradication.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communication links in the catastrophe area are across many locations.
The fuel reserves are also exhausting.
The suspicious answer of Miss Finland Finalist and the long reflection caused a laughter wreck
In Billnäs Ruuk, new Miss Finland is currently being chosen.
At the interview round, a question was asked to each Miss Finalist.
The finalists asked me a question about the glass bowl on the stage.

The question to the Anttikos had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer as good as before he started hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said to think.
In the public, the break of the report took the time of laughter until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...

Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue by the time it comes.
This recipe is for you with good, acidified apples from your own back, as domestic apples are at a shocking price.
A pear may have to buy, even though a lot of people think it's growing in a pear tree.
This cake can also be made of apples only if it does not want to buy pear.
Of course, the taste is more diversified if it also sands its pear.
Corn apples and pear and remove seed wool.

Sweep the bread leaf with pastry paper, sweep 2 meals of sugar on the bottom of the leaf and spread pears onto the sugar.
He snuck half the taint on pears and the apple blocks on the tail.
The end snuck on the apple blocks.
Cookie in the oven at approximately an hour at 180 degrees until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let him cool in the goat and then reverse the waiters.
Cut the cake in a real cooled way.

Statussymbols don't attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes people popular, charismatic or admiring?
The researchers of the Sydney University analysed the subject have identified two different types of "colity", which consist of a slightly different nature: generally attractive coolness and the opposite contradiction-colity.
Appreciatively cool people, according to the description of researchers, had many socially desired features: they were outward, friendly, peaceful and qualified.
In contrast, there was a typical distance, independence, rebelism and a break.
They were thirsty with experience and only cared little about external evaluations.
Both types united good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not cool longer: high status in teen age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the United States survey published in 2014 in Child Development reports.
Young people who dated early, celebrated, applied to good-looking crowds and pursued the popularity of others, had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes as young adults.
In their human relationships, they managed less than they used to do with their most unacceptable age mates.
The high-state locks of wolves, bags or watches don't make people cool, or at least genuinely attractive associations.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine in August, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their normal market shirt than with those dressed in their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a branding shirt.
If you're on a Greek holiday island, watch out!
There's a storm in there. The weather warning to shouts from the red.
During the weekend, in southern Greece as much water as the average in Finland during the six months may be raining.
The Zorbas horror storm hits Greece during the weekend.
You should be prepared to stay in Peloponnesos, the Ionian islands, Kyklate or Creta.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Ateenan Embassy will report it on its Facebook site.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has provided red weather warnings to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported by the weather service in Foreca blog.
According to this, the toughest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, you punched Finland from the first week in the Kuisma storm blowing the thighs of 31 metres per second.
According to the Blog, however, the greatest concern of the Storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
The weekend in South Greece may be more than 300 millimetres of water.
It corresponds about half of the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of a storm on its Facebook page.
The Storm of Zorbas has previously caused floods in Tunisia and Libya this week.

Now we are making Easter grass grow, but we do it a little surprisingly, and Anku suggests and presents sawdust, panties, and seeds of fresh grass, of which he makes a silk.

The Lord Bottas shaked and squeezed adrenaline in Sotsh... is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
The Valter Bottas shaked a little more ten minutes after the Russian gp swings when he was in front of the media.
A fine round left Lewis Hamilton, one by Mercedes, and was surely emotionally important even to the Finnish man who was gathering this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the resolution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I have been on the stake only once this year, in Austria (medium), so the time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I've got a good turn again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sotsh track, so the departure is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to respond to the curiosity whether he was driving tomorrow from the victory or is there before the Jeesaing of Hamilton approaching the MM title.
My starting point for the race is definitely the fact that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the stake, Bottas staked.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettil is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it keeps in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas completed.
After driving, Hamilton was truly happy about Bottaksen’s success, and the Mercedes’ tallipomo toto Wolff also tasted it.
Lewis had a plan to win Valter, but he couldn't do it in the sec.
He knows he's gonna have to tear everything up to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that the adrenaline squeezed out of his ears, Wolff squeezed.
The question is whether the stable will allow Bottaksen and Hamilton to drive straight, Wolff answered in a way.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitelainen Erno Kinnunen reached the rall Championship of Finland
The SM series of rides ended rarely.
Hardly ever before, brothers have ended up as Finnish masters at the same time.
It has now been done in the Turku and Salo environment in the windulas Eerik and Henrik Peternen, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The Kitelainen Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the decision contest sealed him with the class SM4 of two-wheel cars in Finland.
The Kinnune, who was competing with Honda Civic, and the manor reader Ville Mäkelä, started at the Turku competition stage, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM account.
In the darkness of the Friday night, the twin had to provide an adjustment when some of the extra lights were cheated on another special experiment.
It's got to squeeze a third in a time of blindness.
In a situation like that, it doesn't fit to be silly.
On Saturday, only one was followed at the speed of Jussi Tepo, said Kinnunen.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw its troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, over.
In his UN speech Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Mr Merkel told me in Germany that there is an October meeting for Syria, which would include the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the judge-dramatic TV of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received exceptionally many people.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were given the ranking drama of the Supreme Court judge on Thursday.
At that time Kavanaugh, named Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judicial Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the consultations were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20,4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultations, several million more followed.
NBC reported that livestock trimmeds followed 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they had made a record of 8.2 million live shipments in the year.
The number of CNNs will increase by more than 10 million when it is calculated that they have followed the shipment through Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million.
Digital launches are channels own, TV surveys come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but in any case they're dizzy.
It's rare to get to 20 million.
More than 20 million audiences in the United States are usually accessed only to sports games and the big Oscar and Grammy gala and random political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The US's year-to-year programme, the American football League for the NFL final match for Super Bowl, of course.
This year, Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people to the NBC.
Last year, the first talk of Trump to Congress, Nielsen, said that nearly 48 million people and 30 million officials were viewed.
It's the most important thing.
The appointment of the Supreme Court of Justice is an extremely important case in the United States, as offices are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died from early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the bridges of President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called "white language", whose vote could be decided by the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, resolved in 2015 with a vote that the same sexes received the right to marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his people.
His choice in the Supreme Court may be locked in the court for decades of conservative overpower.
Children have the right to get their information to parents
Parents of children under 10 years of age only see the Kanta service of their children’s health information.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents were unable to even look at the health information or the recipes of the infants.
The situation was temporarily described as a correction in autumn 2016 for people under the age of 10 years.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has taken a surprising long time to repair it.
Now the correction is in place - in 2020.
As the problem is clear, the change of the legal base should not have been more than an auction.
Then the painting understands that the button is pressed: when the pipe is held, we open it.
Of course, the child can show his parents his information if he has a bank card or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is paid, and the banknote is not even paid for by 10 years of age.
In practice, no one can see the data of the 4th grade school except by asking for it as printed.
It is not about the right of parents or the right of children.
It is extremely important for parents to be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even minors may have family situations in which all the issues are not free to talk about.
Often they are related to sexual health, which is fundamentally relevant to the free care of human rights.
In the U.S., the FBI started to defuse the assault charges on Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will find out about at least two women's aggression charges.
One of the women had been consulted earlier this week by the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs.
Kavanaugh has disputed the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
President of the United States Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the senate's judiciary.
The investigation should not last for a week.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation of an unrestricted investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The attached smuggler continues to gamble at the chamber.
The police say he's put a man in a police jail to "relax."
The police were subjected to a suspect's threat on the night before Saturday in Kajaan.
The authorities will inform you of the case that started when a fair 30-sold man challenged a brutal fight at the central restaurant.
First, he was assaulted by another customer inside the nutrient movement.
This followed the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to step in, he still hit him.
The trivial treatment led to the call of the police.
Scout caught the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police tell you.
The suspect still acted aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in his leg.
He threatened to kill and assassinate the cops.
The police say he's sent a man to the police jail to "relaunch."
The man is suspected of three assaults and of the violent opposition of the official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start work in Indonesia with Sulawes - "Fresh water is the most urgent"
The UN Children’s Organization Unicef and other international assistance organisations are ready to assist in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Finland’s information manager Unicef.
The local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activities, Unicef always has a full emergency emergency, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please in Sulawes, rescue operations are under way, but the situation in the Donggala region is a little more inconclusive in the north.
There are still places to which connections do not work.
Assistance measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Buildings are often light-trained in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection, for example, for the first time, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are often able to offer water-cleaning tablets that Unicefi has in storage.
Water systems are designed to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency case water is transported at first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Searching for family members and joining families is part of the Unicef mission field.
The World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN, is also organised by food assistance.
At the start of the emergency aid, previously collected funds are used.
However, among other things, Unicef has already begun to collect money to assist the earthquake and the victims of tsunami in Indonesia.
Mr. Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Tesla Government, will end the fines of $20 million in tweets.
Elon Musk, founder of companies producing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Mr Elon Musk, as chairman of the Tesla Government, ends his mission and accepts fines of $20 million.
Musk is avoided as part of the agreement he concluded with the U.S. Securities Markets Supervisory Authority.
By reconciling Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission, SEC, threatened Muski for securities fraud due to the tweets he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing the electric car company Tesla's withdrawal from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the share rate of the company.
According to the agreement, Musk must not be chaired by the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" of his government and take two "independent leaders".
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk communication.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to the personal fines of 20 million dollars in Musk, Tesla also has to pay 20 million corresponding fines to the financial supervisor.
The tweets misleading investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla's shareholders to mislead.
Musk argued that he would have ensured the financing of Tesla's repurchase from the stock market to a private limited company.
According to the billionaire twitches, the company would have been purchased off the stock market at a price of $420.
Tesla's stock rate rose by more than ten per cent a day after tweets, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim to be financed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock market with another management group or the company's government.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when the SEC declared a fraud prosecution.
It is expected to reinforcing the company's course in order to settle the news.
There is no reason for the last judgment
Of course, the watches of the Criminal Church do not ring when the wise ones do not move.
It's a technical defect.
The time of the Tower of the Principality of Helsinki has stopped.
The wise ones will show you at twelve.
It's like a mid-time horror film, even when the church crypta belongs to the exorcism and the urns are ringing.
Of course, this is not the case, but the time has stopped because of technical reasons: it has broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some of the parts have been broken, and there's a new part expected to be there, says the suntio Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church is already mentioned in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence is not a reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church watches don't ring for fault.
