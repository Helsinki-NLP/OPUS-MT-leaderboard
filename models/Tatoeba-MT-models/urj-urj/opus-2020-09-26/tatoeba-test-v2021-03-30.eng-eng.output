He's not a good cook.
Tom said he wasn't in any hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come and watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my apartment co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there is no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure if he was supposed to kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom might have to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to do what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tired of doing that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he'd be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not hard.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We haven't succeeded yet.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he hadn't eaten anything, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.

Tom told me he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary he should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing guitar until he was 30 years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I have reason that Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I had.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't spoken to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't asleep.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'll have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know that Tom is much more creative than Mary is.
I know that Tom is much more creative than I am.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom said he was desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
He's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he was glad he could do that.
You can't buy one for less than $30.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he liked dancing with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.
I doubt Tom will run for the president.
Tom should have done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary won't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't have to do that.
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.

I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he thinks I'd be able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I can do what Tom is doing.

Tom said he had no objection to our leaving early.
It's not for beginners.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were depressed.

Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early as tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many miles is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behavioural and speech patterns that characterize the advantages.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at 6:00.
Tom told Mary he'd do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's over.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was through that.
Tom said he appealed to his suspension.
He's deeply attached to him.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you, we have to assume that Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigarette in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I don't think that question is appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could've cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom is doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.
Now I'm fairly sure that's not gonna happen.
They're not as messy as they used to be.

Tom told me he wasn't sleepy.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but he wasn't.

I wonder if this really works.
Let's get to the point.
Did you give Tom the key?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to be married to Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom often does that by himself.
I've learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay at home all day.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.

I know Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary has done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was gonna help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't know he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that's not worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended.
I'm very grateful to you.

We're planning to go tomorrow.
I think Tom's snoring louder than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that.

You're really an angel!

Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I'd like to do that.
It won't be that hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that on his own.
I was so excited!
Tom's a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom is unlikely to have to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
Nobody's better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell you he was angry.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.

Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I was by your side!
Get your paws off me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you just retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should have just walked in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We're a brother and a sister.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Haven't you got a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play mandolin as well as you.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.

It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you were planning to do that next winter.
I don't know what this means.
I think it is more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
Do Tom and Mary both snore?
It's way past the time Tom promised to be here.

It's not rocket science.
Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt lightheaded.
You know you shouldn't do that, right?
Nothing has been done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.

Tom said he thought that could happen in Boston too.
I didn't know Tom was ancoma.
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.

Tom said he didn't think he could do that today.
I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I'm as happy as I can be.
If they knew what was going to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake Tom and tell him breakfast's ready.

Let me know if there's anything I can do.

The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Tom's not home right now.
Tom said he likes to ski too.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this with you.
I don't think you should have done that by yourself.
Tom said Mary thought she might not want to do that until it gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was annoyed.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
Tom said he's faster than Mary does.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
We split up the robe in three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that by himself.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom's probably not going out with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could do that.
I know Tom couldn't do that.
Keep left on the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was disobedient.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the 20th of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is so interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone could help me with that.
Tom definitely knows he shouldn't do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was gonna be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said Mary thought she might not have to do that by herself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible that Tom may not know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it wasn't gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're called.
My daughter is being trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they weren't ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom's a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
He's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except for me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to that.
I'm a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he didn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to do that alone.
He wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom's a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's the smartest boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to go anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom's about the same height you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he was glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that she had lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they planned to go Monday.
It won't be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they were trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to piss me off.
That's a mistake.
One way isn't better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he puts his mind on.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be mad at me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that correctly.
He's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better at French than he really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was gonna do that today.
They promised that they would check on it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never did!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good at French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluent as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I've just hard-cooked an egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy anything they need for $300.
They said they liked this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that he can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom's a very close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would probably not agree to that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious that Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom's gonna give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom's ever asked Mary why he didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I have to do that.
I plan on staying home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amusing by what's going on?
We haven't begun to fight yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in his bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I forgot about that.
Tom told everyone he was through that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom's a lot longer than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's gonna happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's faster than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you, I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked all over the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as most people think he is.
You're not gonna do that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been 30 years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom's read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's done enough already.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail?
If something sounds too good to be true, then probably it is.
Tom said he hoped you wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I wasn't planning to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know, Tom and I are not going to do that, are you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have left behind.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought maybe you couldn't do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
He doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom's a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not feasible with current technology.
They said they were trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they were sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think he's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelet?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he was willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I don't think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I think we talked on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what to do yet.
I know Tom's a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed us all.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he was planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
The wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he was supposed to do.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they're gonna hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't be paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your rain when you leave here.
I'll make sure that's done.
I wear a suit but I don't wear a tie.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might be coming down cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where are Tom and Mary going to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night, I was puking.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's nothing anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played a chess with Mary.
I know Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom's motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I don't think Tom would like it if Mary did.
I still wish you'd do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not gonna happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think that Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I got lost in the woods.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants.
I'll wait till 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it's gonna take him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth!
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that would happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom's not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary was scared.
You should have been the last to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where he's farming it.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with an alien.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overemotional.
I'm immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of himself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know that Tom knew who was going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we do.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hoped you could take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried Tom's gonna get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know Tom did that to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners, I hate everyone.
Tom said she wasn't sure she could swim.
I don't know if Tom's coming tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom's the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom's gonna have time to do that with us today.
I know Tom's very contemplated.
We can't let these starters push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew that Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
I've already told Tom I'm not planning on doing that.
I thought it would be fun living in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
It's nice to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying a thing than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided that he won't say yes.
I know Tom's a little snobby.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew she might not want to do that by herself.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Adopting that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me he thought Mary was missing.
Tom said Mary lied.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they weren't there.
They said they thought I could win.

I don't think this is the time or place to discuss this.
Tom thought Mary wasn't driving a car.
I'm not a fan of libertarianism.
I know Tom won't help Mary do that.

Tom and Mary weren't planning on doing that until John asked them to.
If you'd left home a little earlier, you would've been in time.
You can't be too careful when driving.
Tom said Mary thought she might want to do that tonight.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I would have bought more clothes if I had the money.
I thought I told you not to talk to my daughter.
Tom and Mary told me they just did that.
What are the chances Tom will win?
I'm afraid you can't.
I don't think Tom's gone by the time we get there.
Tom said he was planning to stay in Boston.

That's not what I'm gonna talk about.
Both Tom and John say they've kissed Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary was ready.
I know I've been lied to.
Tom's the one that's going to be punished.
It's a shame you can't join us.
I know I should do this.
I can't believe you did this.
Tom said he wanted to help.
Why does everyone think that we're stupid?
What are the positive sides?
The battery indicator light shows that the battery is not charged.
I thought you looked sad.
Tom said he wasn't planning to go.
You know I should do that today, don't you?
I didn't think you realized what you were doing.
Tom said he was glad no one was injured in the accident.

I don't think people should do that.
I think this is a serious matter.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really had to do that.
Tom taught French to his friends.
I thought Tom might not be allowed to do that today.
Mr Yoshida is home in French history.

Are you exhausted?
I left as soon as I was asked.
I don't have anything to do!
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I don't think I'm being unreasonable.

They told us they could speak French.
You're deceived.
We talked to everyone.

Tom's interested.
I'm sure Tom will do that.

I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to work together.
I wish I could have done it by myself.
I need a little help.
I have serious doubts about their plans to succeed.
You could have saved me a trip if you just told me I didn't have to be here today.

Is it okay if I sit here?
Nothing is as important as peace.
I thought we'd be there in time, but we didn't.

What are you gonna do with that?
I thought you said you wanted to do that this morning.
I thought I'd do that by myself.
I realized Tom wasn't joking.
There is no chance that Tom will forget to do that.
Tom didn't think Mary was the one who did that.
Prepare to die.

I know Tom didn't know if Mary wanted to do that or not.
Tom said Mary thought it was unlikely John would do that.
Where's the entrance to the underground car park?
They say they'll pay for everything.
Tom said he assumed you would do that.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom's going.
You should make sure you don't make Tom angry.
I didn't know we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not going to try to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.
Tom said he thought he'd do that.
I don't think Tom will be alone.
I can't figure out why he's done that.

Tom said Mary was probably out.
Why don't you put on some clothes?

We're changing our clothes.
Tom knows Mary should do that.
You knew Tom was a ballet dancer, didn't you?
Tom said he needed more sleep.
I think Tom knows why.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
I don't like cats and my brother either.
Tom is obviously very rich.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that.
Tom said Mary doesn't think John's gonna do that.
I thought it had to be good.
It might be good to do that.
I thought Tom had seen me.
If I knew Tom's address, I would have written to him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was amusing.
Tom thought Mary was charming.
Someone should have told Tom he was doing that the wrong way.
I knew Tom shouldn't go outside.
Do you have vegetarian pilaf?
I know you need to go to Boston.
I knew Tom was a bum.
I have a question.
Tom's taking a shower every morning.
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that.
I think Tom could be the person we need.
This isn't surprising at all.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I think Tom's doing that too.
Tom said he heard someone snoring.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
Tom knows the time is running out.
I think it was Tom's mistake.
Tom said he thought Mary was having a good time in Australia.
Tom says he's planning on going to Australia with Mary.

I don't think you'll have the same problems I had.
This book is worth reading twice.
Tom said he thought Mary was ready to do that.
I wish that had happened.
It won't hurt.

You look like you're not having any fun.
I thought you wanted to go to Australia.
Tom told me he thought Mary was lost.
Tom said he couldn't do anything he had planned to do.
Tom said he didn't want to give a speech.
I assume we're doing a pretty good job since no one's complained.

Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Did you know that Tom only had one leg?
I think Tom's talking to Mary about that right now.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
I knew Tom was a better cook than me.

I know Tom knows Mary didn't want to do that.
I hope I don't say anything stupid.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Tom's gonna be very sorry he didn't do that.
They let me know they wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I can't come today.
Both Tom and Mary are scared.
I thought Tom looked exhausted.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
I know I can trust you.
I know Tom did that correctly.
Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wasn't going to cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom's just curious.
Everyone knows that Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could rely on you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know Tom had to do that alone.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me he was hesitant to do that.
I pretended I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom's a bum.
I didn't think Tom would allow you to do that.
I want to go change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom's lonely.
This isn't the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, then probably nobody else can either.
I thought Tom might stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You should let Tom know that Mary will do that.
It would have been fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan on doing that anymore.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Tom said Mary was nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty.
I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay.
Tom said he definitely won't do that.
I'm not gay, but my boyfriend is.
You know that's not right.
Tom and Mary told me they didn't want that.
I know Tom was at your house today.
Tom won't be able to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were going to work.
Tom hasn't told you what happened yet.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to win.
Tom said Mary was unsensitive about that.
Tom said he wished he wasn't so late.
They said they were suspicious.
Did you know that Tom was planning on moving to Boston?
Tom said he assumed Mary would want to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I would never do that to you.
Tom should have done that faster than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needs.
They know they can do better.
There's no way Tom would have done what you said he did.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary say they used to study French.
Tom admitted he'd killed Mary.
I would've been there by now if my car hadn't broken down.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were gonna kill me.
I think there's a chance that Tom would do that.
It's surprising that they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot that's happening right now.
I wonder if Tom's rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom was doing.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the moscon he had run over was dead as a doorband.
Tom and Mary said they weren't mad.
I wonder if Tom ever told Mary about what we did that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia is because everyone else in his family did.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
He has a great pleasure in traveling.
Tom said Mary was probably still in jail.
I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were home-sick.
I think you know we need to buy more food.
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must have left his umbrella on the bus.
They told me they were broke.
Nobody but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised what happened.
I assume you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to understand.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one's seen them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he'd definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom's a student at Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that the wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think John was glad that would happen.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would have arrived sooner.
They said they would do that for us.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
Tom said he thought the prices at that store were too high.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother had given him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.
Tom and Mary say they only talk to you.
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I've parked my car here many times and no one's complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary was ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning to get here?
I know you're not planning on staying in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't help looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence currently available does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he was very sure Mary had to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt resentful.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same way.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided he's not going to work today.
Tom refused that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not gonna work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I would have been unable to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he was looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've been waiting for Tom to get along with Mary.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom wasn't aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination of this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary's not planning on doing that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you had to do that today.
You should have registered your children months ago.
I don't think that's mine.
I believe Tom's 30 years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone had ever done that before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on doing that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It won't end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
I thought you were jury-ripping something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom's the only man I'd ever consider marrying.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was paralyzed.
I know Tom's not planning on doing that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as difficult as it sounds.
Tom and Mary screamed, but nobody heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swim.
Tom said Mary was probably still lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be rude to me anymore.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom wanted to see this movie.
I think Tom's still undecided.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner.
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom is really asleep.
Tom and Mary said they wanted to die.
Tom said he's had enough of that.
I suspect Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's very bright.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here.
Doing that would have been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't have to do that, did you?
Tom suspected it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat back.
Tom was wearing the tie Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
The question is not as much what it is as it looks.
I know Tom's almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do that by yourself.
Tom must have had a key.
Tom knew there was a chance that Mary would do that.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were famine.
It's not socially acceptable to point to people.
Tom would have allowed Mary to do that.
I wish we'd stayed in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary is planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week Tom has done that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary will say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a laptop in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was afraid.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I figured I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's fine.
Tom said he didn't think he had to do that.
Tom said Mary knew she might not want to do that until John had time to help her.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I should never have gotten you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your pool?
Tom said Mary's probably still gruchy.
Tom said he thought that Mary would probably not want to do that.
Tom said he was coming, but he never showed up.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom will be able to do that eventually.
The doctor advised me to leave the ride because it was too much exercise.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said he was.
I don't think Tom will be back.
No one was on the bus.
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
Tom thought he lost his wallet, but eventually found it after searching the house for an hour or so.
Tom told me he wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear that Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I might have to do that soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that has to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
He took her by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me that Mary did the wrong thing.
I knew that Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courtesy.
I guess that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary could do that too.
That's a mistake a lot of people make.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom's much younger than Mary is.
It's not an easy solution.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
There is no doubt that Tom will do that for us.
I don't have anything to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning to do.
Men wear short sleeves.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
I knew that eventually this would happen.
It's not hard to guess what's gonna happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
I thought everyone knew.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be amusing about what was happening.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
It's not a secret anymore.
Tom told me he didn't know Mary.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend.
I can't stand this noise.
I know Tom's a lot better at doing that than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were murdered.
I guarantee that won't happen.
Tom claims he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's tough.
Tom has decided that he will say yes.
I hope Tom's not dead.
They said they didn't do that.
Tom knows this is a tough situation.
Tom knew what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad.
Tom said Mary was willing to cook.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom's a pretty good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed Chairman yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the refrigerator.
What are you good at?
I wonder if Tom and Mary were supposed to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to work late.
I suspect Tom and Mary both have houses in Australia.
Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who had to do that.

I wonder if Tom's reliable.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I knew Tom was studying.
I know Tom's a gun owner.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
Nobody's done it yet.
Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
I know Tom's gonna do that with me this afternoon.
We're not planning on doing that together.
Let's see why your answers differ from mine.
They told me they disagreed.
I don't think Tom was upset.
Tom knows he should do that, but he doesn't want to.
Tom is also a member of our group.
My parents don't let me do that.
They told me they didn't win.
Tom said he wasn't having fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't very energic.
They say they like marigolds.
"Is everyone talking about me?" "No, Tom, you're not that important."
I don't think it's hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Are both Tom and Mary still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom wasn't finished doing that yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was alone.
I promise I won't hit anyone.
Tom said he'd try to do that today.
Both Tom and Mary used to live on Park Street.
I know Tom knows Mary should do that.

The joke is on you.
I'm determined to give up smoking.
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.
Tom told me he liked snow.
Tom and Mary should never have done that together.
Every man can't be happy.
I promise I won't do that.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during the rising thighs of prosperity and still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken in the midst of gathering clouds and rageous storms. At these moments, America has carried on not just because of the skill or vision of those in the high office, but because we people have remained faithful to our forefathers, and true to our founding documents.
Tom didn't know Mary had gone to Boston.
I was the only one who knew Tom wanted to do that.
Tom says he's gonna win.
I know Tom rarely does that anymore.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still alone.
I don't think I'd enjoy doing that outside the winter.
The rumor spread quickly.
There's no way you're going out dressed like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we'll all die.
You're embarrassing.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that tomorrow.
It's not that weird, is it?
I didn't know I was in violation of any law.
Do you promise me you'll do that?
You should tell Tom he's probably not winning.
They say they're willing to help.
There's a chance it's real.
I know I did the right thing.

I thought you were gonna stay with Tom.
I don't think Tom's involved.

Tom said Mary thought she might want to do that tonight.
I thought Tom had already been compensated for that.

Tom said he thought I didn't look like I was enjoying myself.
There's no reason Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he'd try.

There's a chance that Tom was wrong.
I'm fat.

Let's go to the beach.

Tom and Mary told me they were terrified.

Do you plan to do that?

There's nothing to apologize for.
I'd rather go swimming.

Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
I didn't know you were gonna be nervous.
I know you don't like me, but we have to work together.
I know you should do that.
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday.
A true friend would have helped.
I know Tom will love it.
Tom told me he thought I should lose weight.
Tom said he'd rather do that next week.
I think Tom's prejudiced.
I thought it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure.
I haven't called back yet.
Tom said Mary didn't look much older than John.
Tom's probably a little younger than I am.
You're out of danger.
It's not worth fixing this camera.
I know that's not the truth.

I didn't know Tom had only one leg.
Hello again.
The show's on Wednesday.
I'm home right now.
I soon found out I wasn't talented enough.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't really Tom.
Go away and leave me alone!
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to do that.
It's not always easy to tell the difference between good and bad.
Tom's even lazyer than Mary.
That's not funny.
I don't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but at least he wanted to give it a shot.
I suspect Tom's already left for Australia.

What will the neighbors think?

Good night.
It's gonna be okay.

When was the last time you visited Boston?

The world is not as scary as you think.
I think Tom's deranged.
I know you don't want to do that, but you have to.
Let's hope that's enough time.

I'm so glad to see you.
I didn't think anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
Put your socks on fast.
Tom told everyone he was starving.

I know Tom's planning on doing that tomorrow.

It's not especially hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.

If you don't go, I won't either.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know Tom doesn't know I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I knew Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary he was glad that it had happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know you're not stupid.
He didn't show up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of the night.
I didn't think Tom was stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should do.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom's nuts.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom knew they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary hadn't asked him to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom's going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we could do that.

The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grew up in Boston.

I know Tom's a good writer.
They said they never want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
Well.
I know Tom's not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know that's gonna be hard to do.
How do you plan on doing that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you'd learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom's just as smart as Mary.
They wished they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom's planning to quit his job.
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad nobody's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give him.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm much taller than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French.
I know Tom would be quicker to do that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do so much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he didn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that on purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that the other night.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
I suspect Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I can do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
He avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary was looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Everyone likes Tom.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He hasn't got a cell phone.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom's involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are fine.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time that you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he was sleepy.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I pried off the lid.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anybody in Boston.
I've been on diet for over a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know Tom's a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather van.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom's throwing up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to be married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I assume Tom's still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom might be able to do that sometime today.
Did you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom's unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true that Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's not sure what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom probably wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll be there in time.
I think Tom and Mary will be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he wasn't planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he couldn't buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's upset.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he couldn't be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to pay attention to that.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom's alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun living in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we're rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom's a very good drummer.
We know you work for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that on his own anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeasing.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I don't think Tom did that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who should tell Mary that he has to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that will not happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he'd given Mary a book.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a crawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom is planning on doing that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you've quit smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes to do that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This isn't salt.
Has anyone seen Tom here?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was prepared to do that.
We're going to go to a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they were irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I think we have more important things to do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary he should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone please help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy going.
I think Tom's gonna be lonely.
It seems like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle in her new apartment.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you're gonna do that.
They swore they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised I did that, weren't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed.
They said they didn't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said she wouldn't mind if Mary did.
You shouldn't just assume Tom's guilty.
Watch out for yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that was Tom when he was thirteen.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
That's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I had to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you've lost your health that you realize its value.
That could've hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary was the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
He's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom has no prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I've left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I've promised Tom I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said doing that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broke up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog on some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says she and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there'll be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Do anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is unwilling to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said he thought Mary was amusing about what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're unseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom must be irritated.
How long has your head been hurt?
Thanks, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without a parole.
I assume the gun shot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I don't think Tom eats meat.
I hope we don't have any problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom's a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I don't think Tom's the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that's not very likely to happen.
They say drugs aren't safe.
I know it's highly unlikely that anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom probably thought Mary wouldn't cry.
This job is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is the haemophilia.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obligated to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary will get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't gonna do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom's conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they're going to quit doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom's a golfer, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in winter.
What else are you gonna do?
I think that Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was gonna be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
You're still not afraid, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it costs.
Tom said he was healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning to do that.
Don't take your gloves off.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't gonna do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said she and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom's not the one who should do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since I first met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Look at that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be handicapped.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever it was necessary.
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after the dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they weren't likely to win.
Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided to never do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I don't think Tom's made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said Mary knew she didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Tom said it was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would've loved the movie.
They told me they didn't really care what happened.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know Tom was willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you read yesterday in French?
I'm a damage doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with him.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he was trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the funniest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really intends to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you might walk home Mary.
Tom said he hoped Mary was trying to do that.
You like chocolate, don't you?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
Tom hasn't told me where he's planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom told me he had lost his textbook.
Nobody knew Tom was going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I might need to do that.
I'm fairly sure Tom doesn't have any sisters.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during shipping.
They said they might not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.

I know you did this.
I'm very worried about my future.
How could anyone do that to a child?
I know that Tom knows we don't have to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know why he has to do that by himself.
That's not exactly how it happened.
They told me they were certain.
Tom said he didn't think that doing that would be much fun.

I know Tom can do that better than Mary.
My heart is shaking.
Tom has decided he's not going to stay here.

Who did this?
I knew Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
They claimed they didn't cry.

What are we doing here?
I forgot to tell Tom I was going to do that.

You're not leaving Japan for good, are you?
I wonder if Tom's really going to do that today.
How did you know I was gonna say that?

I'm going to New York next week.
This is an unusually difficult language.

Last night, I was puking.
Everyone here except me has done that.
Tom's almost as tall as Mary is.

That's an interesting claim.
You weren't surprised I didn't have to do that, were you?
I'm familiar with this subject.

Tom said you speak French.
I should have gone to the dentist last week.
They told me they were shy.
I don't think Tom's adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said he hadn't seen Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I know you did that.
Tom told Mary I was broke.
I know Tom and Mary have been sick.
I don't understand why anyone would want to do that.
Tom said he was interested in learning how to do that.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope they can do that.
Tom said he jumped out of the way.
"With anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
Don't pretend you're sorry, I know you're not.
Tom told everyone he was disgusting to do that.
This box is pretty heavy!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone yesterday who knows Tom.
I know you can't get away with this.
When someone knocks on the door, my dog starts barking.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom might be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Do you think Tom's already retired?
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know that Tom used to live in Boston?
I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take a rainbow in case.
Tom promised he would tell us.
Tom said he thought there was no need to hurry.
Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks Mary won't be lonely.
Tom and Mary said they'd help.
Did the rainbow you found belong to Tom?
Tom should have done much better.
I know Tom's almost never home on Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know that Tom will like to do that by himself.
Tom said he'd be retired next October.
I didn't know Tom was playing the trumpet.
Do you think it'll rain this weekend?

I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was lonely.
I wonder if Tom's still busy.
What's the name of our CEO?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I was doing pretty well.
Tom admitted he was troubled.
No one could hear what Tom was saying.
Tom said he would visit Mary in Australia next summer.
They're well-being queens.
Not everyone's ready.
There will be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where will the meeting be held?
I think Tom's wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.
Tom says he hopes Mary knows he has to do that.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
That's not a game for kids.
I hope you'll wait for us.
Tom said he was hoping Mary would be here today.
Tom said Mary was worried.
Tom and Mary said they enjoyed teaching French.
Tom said he was really glad Mary did that.
I wonder if Tom found anything.
I'm from South America.
I would have done that a different way.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary's coming or not.
I doubt that Tom would have had the courage to do that.
Tom doesn't want to go to his company's Christmas do this year.
You're nothing but a student.
Tom said he would never allow Mary to do that.
Why do you think Tom likes baseball so much?
I'll call you later.
Many people think that's not gonna happen.
Tom knows he shouldn't eat peanuts.
Tom told me he was gonna try it again.
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Tom said he had confidence in Mary.
Tom thought he might not have to do that anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was gone by the time we got there.
I don't think Tom would let Mary do that on his own.
Don't study.
I thought you were still in Australia.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
I'm not sure Tom and Mary want to go there.
I don't think it'll take very long to do that for you.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I both stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't have to hurry.
I know you have more important things to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I haven't read all the books.
Tom should never have been set off.
Did you know that Tom isn't planning to attend today's meeting?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why he was fired.
Tom said Mary would probably have to do that.
This is the kind of music I like to listen to.
He crocheted himself a jumper.
I know Tom used to be good at doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary he didn't need to do that.
I knew Tom was afraid the police might arrest him.
I suspect Tom didn't visit Australia.
I thought it would take months.
They thought they could do that for me.
It's been ages since we last met.
I realize that Tom could be done by 2:30.
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a present.
Tom must have seen something.
I thought you said we weren't gonna be here.
They say they're not afraid to do that.
Mary became pregnant at the age of 14.
I think Tom has to go.

It's a deal.
I should have been able to do that for you.
I know I shouldn't have asked Tom to do that, but I did.
I wonder if Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
I'll check on Tom.
I hope you're good.
You don't think Tom suspects anything, do you?
They told me they'd help.
He's hard to please.
Tom and Mary said they were embarrassed.
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that himself.
Tom said he suspected Mary would do that.
Tom will be very suspicious if you do that.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that's true.
It's not urgent.
Tom knew he had to eventually tell Mary the truth.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like going to Australia.

I don't think we should do that until next month.

I'm dying of laughter.

They said they'd do that for free.

Tom said he really did that without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom's prepared to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a mile.
Tom said he probably won't do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom's a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they'd hope it'll happen soon.
Tom said he's not being used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By daybreak, the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom's expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they didn't want to do that.
The price of gas is so high that we cannot buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be discreet.
"Thank you." "For what?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me they were displeasing.
Tom and Mary say they have to do that.
Let's hope that never happens again.
I don't think that really happened.
Tom said Mary was arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting that he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a chess game.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you gonna be okay?
They told me they were famine.
I thought something was serious about Tom.
Tom said he wasn't sleepy yet.
Tom assumed everyone knew Mary was going to do that.
I know Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
They say they like studying French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was gonna stay up all night.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter's often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there were still a lot of things to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was glad that was going to happen.
You always doubt my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know Tom's not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I don't think Tom should agree to do that.
I don't think Tom's sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should have told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning on staying in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Tom wanted to do that too.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone's given up.
Let's get our photo taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'd probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know that Tom knows I had to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I wasn't very hungry.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I could borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom's not an angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give him something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he was willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom's still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows Mary's not planning to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone sing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not missing me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released in prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I'd do.
He didn't have to bring the rainbow.
Both Tom and Mary weren't at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I have to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him last afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired I can hardly walk.
They felt they had to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but don't speak.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's crushed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could've gotten home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unrepressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do yet.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew that Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would've gotten here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There is no doubt that Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I was unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I thought Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom's happy.
I'm baking fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll land in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were gonna fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he won't be allowed to do that.
They say they're not sure.
I know Tom didn't know he couldn't do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John's actually gonna do that.
They say they also have to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snooping.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
Business isn't a goodness.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom's as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought the prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he was hoping he could do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unfeared.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with the times.
Tom was hoping he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's kind of a cat.
Tom probably thought Mary would refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom refused to accept the bribe.
Tom said he thought that doing that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait till morning?
We'll land in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom's unprejudged.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be rude.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
He has to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This isn't a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had had more time.
I don't think you really have to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he wasn't sure Mary had to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought doing that would be fun.
I think you'll find out that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was quite genius.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you were there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that will happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me he thought Mary was being truthful.
It's pretty likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom's never gonna do that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they were doing just fine.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who should tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that it's not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom's a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistake.
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he'd be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts you'll be able to pass the examination.
Where's everybody?
How have you been?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not mandatory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your baggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he was glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not rain.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would've wanted.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he probably didn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a chance Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom's a second.
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan on doing that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he could.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the garment stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he'll die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you would tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it was a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary he thought he was doing it wrong, but he didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said Mary thought she might have to do that.
Tom said he would never try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom's given me a lot of things.
I know Tom's a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they're not planning on staying home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we should do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hoped you'd try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that tonight.
I don't think I know the man who plays the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary swore they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to know what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from the University of Kyoto.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have much fun doing that.
I don't think Tom does that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm gonna skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was scared.
Tom has already told me that he decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to lend me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea Mary didn't know what he was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know that Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car, neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted that what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would really do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's lived in this house a long time.
Tom refused to steal the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he's gonna do yet.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom's obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not gonna happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had recovered completely.
I didn't know you were planning on doing that by yourself.
I don't think there's a way out of here.
There's no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John was talking French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at that time.
Tom and Mary said they were ticklish.
Tom said he couldn't help weed the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I'd be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, what's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh vegetation is sold here.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's irritated.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was happy that had happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom's in Boston.
Tom refused to meet Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländers.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not yet thirty.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was worried.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked her to.
We can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's amusing.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm taller than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he probably didn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set his glass down.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I've bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom surely understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to do that.
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was gonna be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't gonna do that.
Tom said he probably didn't have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have gotten that job.
Tom told Mary he was his one and only.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're terrific.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary would not go to Australia unless he went with him.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I don't think Tom wins very often when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we've bought everything we need.
Tom said he probably didn't have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they were unfeared.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary probably wouldn't do that.
I thought you said we weren't gonna do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous to do that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We can't make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they shouldn't park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they would be willing to help us.
Tom told me he'd done that.
Tom's not the same as he was 30 years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she has to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he'd try something he'd never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he'd kissed Mary good night.
If you do that, I will too.
I think Tom is unplaceable.
They told me they were tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
Which book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they hope they can do that.
I know that Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom's ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was taller than his sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
I'm buying things that I know I'm not gonna use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me he wasn't gonna do that.
I know Tom's much stronger than I am.
It wasn't an easy decision.
I wonder if I can still do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
It's Tom's thirteenth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said he did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They were hoping they'd be able to win.
Tom said he was glad Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I don't think you should have bought that car.
Tom told Mary he wasn't willing to do that.
I should've known Tom was busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone yelling.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
Nobody asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.

Something's wrong.
Tom believes Mary's trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.

I don't think Tom's gonna be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know that Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary's been here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I've bought everything I need.
Tom said he had nothing to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom was gonna ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was Tom's first time?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we moved to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary was alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was chrombed.
Tom said he thought Mary had already done that.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom's still in love with his ex-wife.
I know that Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom rarely waits for anyone.
I just assumed everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried that by myself.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I had to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom's probably gonna have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of ignoring him.
I thought you wanted to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was gonna do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know that Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I'd like you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.

Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary has never done that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself.

I thought it'd clear up in the afternoon.

Tom says Mary is trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway.

He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it'll rain tomorrow.
I didn't know that Tom owned a gun.
I thought there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bicycle.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my desk.

You're not really planning to help Tom, are you?
Tom, it's not necessary to apologize.
I'm already late.
Tom knows he has a problem.

It won't be as hard to do as you think it will be.

Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.

Tom said he did that for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary's not sure whether John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary don't do that faster than I do.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
The way you plan to do that is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom's strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I seriously doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he was really glad he moved to Australia.
I know Tom's a forest Ranger.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they'd only talk to you.
French is his mother tongue.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that again.
They know they should do that today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hasn't asked Mary to do that yet.

I don't think doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he should do.

Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.

I think this is the first time Tom's done that.
Tom was hoping he wouldn't be punished.
I know that Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'm gonna like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you told him you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though she had asked her not to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom's probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.

Tom says the party's over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself.
Safety is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here.
Did you know I was going to be arrested?
He's a despicable human being.
Tom's already planning on doing that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost as tall as you are.
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I don't think Tom's ever done that.
I thought we could help out.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom's planning on doing that today.
You're the same age I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished to give Mary flowers.
They said they had an alibi.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good a driver as you say you are.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that.

What time is it now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.

I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French.

This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.

I thought you said no one was gonna be here.
Tom thinks Mary's pushy.
I'm skint.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said he assumed Mary would want to do that.
One can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember his name.
Dad works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him he had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I've used to staying up late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said he knew he might not be required to do that by himself.
Nobody told you about the meeting, didn't they?
I know this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here by now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.

Tom has no reason not to do that.
Mary told me she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you were jealous.
I think Tom and Mary both want something to eat.

I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.

What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary was gone.

I know that Tom knows that Mary rarely does that anymore.
You're brave than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me earlier, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said she was sure she could swim.
What's his problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I view everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you were going to be late.
Tom's delicious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid as it was yesterday.
If I had known how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom repaired his bicycle.
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than me.
Tom and Mary told me they were frustrated.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you've seen people do that.
It's obvious that Tom is waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.

Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary might help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to be having fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
I knew Tom was finished doing that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.

They'll be glad they didn't do that.

Tom is unwilling to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everyone agrees it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put on his clothes.

He's eating.
He's my life's love.
I think Tom's a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing for dinner.
It wasn't that hard to find a pair of shoes that fit.
I would never have let Tom do that.
I've promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a difficult day.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I can do that.
You're to blame.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know Tom would be faster than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart, Tom knew he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was gonna give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's wasting time.

If this is madness, there is a method in it.

They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he wouldn't do that unless I helped him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sincere.
He knows about things like that.

What's your pharmacy's name?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that until October.
What are you worried about, Tom?
Tom's a traveling salesman.
I suspect Tom's not in Boston anymore.
Tom's convinced he needs to do that.
This is the first time I've visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he'd rather not go to Australia with us.
Dinner's not ready yet.
I hope I can help you tomorrow.
Sure we could do that, but it would be really difficult to do.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom is someone I look up.

I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he couldn't do that today.
The fuse's blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in the public.
We should have planned this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they weren't gonna do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!
I think Tom's been to Boston at least once.
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they didn't like studying in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know that Tom is confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.

I met someone yesterday who knows that we did.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
These agenda items were taken for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I have to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.

Tom has no hat.
I don't think I could ever commit suicide.
What time is Tom picking you up?
I didn't know Tom was gonna be here.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to go.
I want someone to talk to.
I didn't know that Tom knew why I had to do that.
I think Tom still has a chance.
I'm married, you're married, let's get married!
It was clear that Tom was expecting you to do that.
We promise you we'll never do it again.
I wonder if Tom bought that house on Park Street he was looking at last week.
I don't think I impressed anyone.
Tom said he felt betrayed.
It is not necessary for us to attend this lecture.
Tom said Mary died.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary wants to do that.
I thought it was pretty clear.
I think I did that pretty well.
I'm learning Arabic.
Tom said he'd be thrilled to do that.
I wonder if Tom really needed to do that.
Tom should have been in Australia when he had the chance.
It's not a computer problem.
How could I have let that happen?
You didn't know if Tom and Mary were going to do that or not, did you?
Tom started laughing and everyone else started laughing, too.
If anyone can do that, you can.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom knows you're not ready.
How can you have a laptop and not a cell phone?
Tom said he thought he could do that today.
I know that Tom and Mary have never done that together.
This method has its pluss and minus.
I know that Tom used to be a preacher.
Tom said Mary kissed him.
They told us they wouldn't do that.
I knew something funny could happen.
I met a friend I hadn't seen for three years.
Sooner or later, I'll get around to do that.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Did you know Tom knew Mary?
I should have given Tom my old thrombone.
I thought Tom would tell you how to do that.
Tom said he shouldn't have done that by himself.
They said they'd laugh.
Tom said it was an accident.
Tom said he had no vices.
I thought Tom would be here by now.
I don't think I've seen you before.
I wrote him a letter.
I know Tom's curious.
Tom said Mary needed to do that.
I doubt we can prove that.
Tom assumed Mary would like the present he bought for her.
I don't think Tom wanted to say anything.
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom that would have ruined the surprise.
Tom told everyone that Mary was there.
I suspect Tom's worried about that.
I don't think you'll ever be able to do that.
That's not fair.
Tom said he agreed to do that.
Looks like you're not having a good time here.
