Two powerful women share their success secrets
What's in common with Barbara Corcoran and Laila Al?
At first sight, these women come from two completely different worlds.
The New York Real Estate Magnes Barbara Corcoran was able to convert the loan of a thousand dollars to a 5 billion-dollar real estate company before implementing its expertise on the telechron, taking part in the ABC's real life series "Shark Tank" investors' panel.
Lala Ali has been on his father's footsteps by becoming the most successful female boxer as a four-fold invincible champion before his residency added the roles of the television broadcaster, the author and the speaker.
Despite their unique career pathways (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women so that they would help talk to all hopeful businesses about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-speed goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them felt that society had made them stereotypically firm roles and expectations.
Consequently, they came out with the project The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a few things about it, but they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey there was not smooth for either one.
In high school and college, Corcoran was mainly awarded Ds and had already worked at 20 jobs when he was 23 years old.
Ali entered one of the most male areas, and in addition, he faced a trial trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was the icon of the world.
These two, softly speaking, pack through the knowledge acquired by difficulties.
Therefore, we sat down with these influential women to talk about crossing failures, success and trusting our guts in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have designed a habit of writing up things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at this list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course, my children inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish I could be a winner in everything I'm doing in life.
I understand that achieving my goals requires hard work, but I am ready to do so.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Lailala, my self-confidence is a key to exaggeration, but I will not take my inspiration from it.
Actually, the inspiration gives me a real curiosity.
What happens when I do it?
What's not gonna happen if I don't do it?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning, because I can't wait for what the day brings with me.
If I don't feel that way someday, I'm just pretending to feel it.
Then I'm gonna believe in my own darkness, and I'm gonna get inspiration again.
Talk about some obstacles to your career, which made you better in the long term.
Barbara Corcoran: It was the hardest thing for me when my business partner left me and married my secretary.
I finished my business a year later, but that year of my life - being a fifth wheel - was terrible because I had no confidence in myself to leave.
I felt undermined, no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
It's the hardest thing to believe in the moment you're hit by the retreat.
The year that took place on foot and business to start again from zero - this time without a partner - was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I would say that in my career it was the hardest time when I was fighting, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to give up the divorce.
I didn't separate myself from my husband, but also from that manager and the man who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do it without him.
So I began to worry about my career's future, and I had to find time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all these experiences in the boxing circle.
You can undoubtedly do it."
So I set up a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to achieve the right state of mind, because all of the others were pushed there.
I did what I had to do, faced with fear and found the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and to continue my career.
When did you feel that you really succeeded?
Laila Ali: I felt successful when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started fighting, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I didn't win the title of the championships on one, but on four occasions.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment I felt that I had succeeded was in my eleventh year of activity.
I finally had a profit.
I had earned some $42,000 profits I couldn't expect.
I went out right now and bought a new car for both mom and dad, and they never had a new car, and I let them deliver cars to Florida where they kept their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I earned it much more in the following years, but nothing has yet been able to provide the same feeling as the opportunity to give my parents something back and surprise them.
How could you keep yourself motivated for this 11-year period to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business according to profit because it was not my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I made myself a dream on the first day of becoming the New York Real Estate Queen.
And I saw myself as a pope in the spirit eyes, all kissing my ring and worshiping me.
I had such a little idea in my head.
So, when I kept working every day, every hour, I didn't mean to make money.
Finally, I made money by accident.
But all the money that came in, I immediately returned to business.
I don't even think I had any spoiling days where I would've thought, "Oh, God, we don't make money.
I was just convinced something was going to work.
The worst that could have happened would have been the loss of the company and the reproducing of the company.
So I would make a good tip, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that the great effort of many people who have succeeded is money.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone who has such great dreams, but who keeps the financial factor back?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I set up a business.
And that's why I found five different partners who were not even specialists in a broker, but in different neighbourhoods throughout the city who knew their streets and breaks.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a gift, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money.
Here's two things: gifts and money.
But if you're not together, nothing big will happen.
In the end, I - and my partners too - have gone very well in all these years together with those magnificent investors I would never have had, if I hadn't had the courage to find people who like to take a step.
It is always possible to obtain money if you believe you have a gift and feel your share of the world better than anyone else.
What are these two or three things you do every morning, which will help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overloaded, being a mother, a business woman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I've reached a point in my life where I really had to set up a routine in the morning.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Thanks for the resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
I often write down my goals for the next day, and when I wake up, I'll re-examine this list.
I'm a medic.
Sometimes I write in the diary.
I always drink coffee.
And I always do the first thing in the morning, because if I don't, I don't do it.
For me, this is the final priority.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then training, and putting my health first.
This makes everything simple.
I feel like I can conquer all the challenges that come on my way in the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm putting things in line with the importance.
I'm working on a list of my tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll set up what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I am trying to agree with the achievement of these most important things.
What are you doing to bring yourself to the right state of mind for a large meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I think I'm falling in front.
It's as weird as it is.
I mean, Lord, I'm failing.
I'm terrified, and it makes me harder.
I imagine anyone who's competing with me - I'm naturally very intimidating because I'm one of ten children and we never got enough attention from our parents.
I may be very competitive.
And I'll always be there too thoroughly prepared.
Excessive preparation will strengthen my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how contradictory we are in this regard.
We are two successful people, and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm a success.
I like to figure out what success is.
I can imagine it in the mind, I actually see it happen.
I see a round of boxing, a battle, a winner of the belt and a dressing room returning, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly, because this confidence is just due to preparation, because the fear in the head is that I don't go well or I don't say the right things or I don't have the necessary information.
This is where I'm getting ready for the game.
But I always enter the final result by visualizing it.
You both have been very successful in your career.
How are you going to give it to me?
Laila Ali: I am very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project, because I feel like this is a chance to do good.
Many women need inspiration, encouragement to strive for their dreams and goals.
We all have a champion.
It is actually about keeping in mind and having the tools you need, surrounded by the right people, with people who have managed to achieve things that you are trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I'm doing very well is inspiration for people.
That's why I was very excited when I was asked to cooperate with Maxx You Project.
I am trying to ignite the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start with their dreams, but they tend to mislead at some point.
So we try to help them focus on their purpose.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as the elevator call, is everything you need to build a company.
What advice would you give to women who want to make progress in the main areas of men?
Laila Ali: I work in one of the most male-centered areas, which is a boxing.
Coming after your father, who was the worldly icon and the best of all time, was quite disgusting.
For me, it was actually the core of finding its talent, courage, strength in itself.
The first thing I had to believe in myself was that I could step into the boxing circle and be successful.
At that moment, no one else except me and me had been involved in any restriction except those I had put myself in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having a attitude like me - "New York Real Estate Queen" - and crossing the finish line is hugely long.
And in this intermediate phase, which is every day in your career, a lot of talents are needed.
In order to require these gifts, there is no need to operate the real estate broker.
I am sure that in the area of Laila it was also necessary to decide which are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, which you can put in, and not how hard you are ready to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these attempts a little more supportive so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here's my three priorities."
If they leave with three main priorities, that things really work out, I'll go home and smile in bed tonight.
What's on your nightclub now?
Laila Ali: Too much collar.
Journals, books, little prayer angel, my journal.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightclub has a little green-circling alarm clock because I tried to break my habit every morning to watch the phone first thing.
That's why I got it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone's still on my nightclub.
What book do you read now?
Barbara Corcoran: Eighth or nineth time, "How to win friends and influence people."
It keeps me in the right direction.
I think it's still the best book that's written in this area, no matter what your dreams are, dreams can't be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to communicate in the same way as in the past today.
I like to read it from time to time.
It'll help me get back to the right road.
Laila Ali: I'm studying at the Nutrition School, which is why I read the book "Niceless Diet".
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our body.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice to cope with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore pessimists.
They meet in all kinds of different shapes.
You need to remove them from your mind vocabulary.
Stay away from the squirrels.
They're sucking you out of energy.
I'm dealing with squirrels as thieves.
They're coming at night, they're drinking your wallet and leaving.
In any team situation, the Pessimists will destroy the team faster than you can look at the eyes because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad.
They're pulling good people together into a hole.
I can avoid excellently all the negative people themselves in the 50 km radius, because my goal is to be positive and take from life everything that gives, and accept everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute on such people?
Laila Ali: It must be consistent.
We'll start on many occasions with certainty that we're taking this path now.
Let's do this, this and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they get over the last hill.
So I think it's necessary to stay on course.
If you feel passion for something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do a hard job that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: To ensure continuity, there's a lot of work to do.
Do you know what it takes to do?
Finish things.
If you start something, stop it.
Many are good beginners, but not very good graduates.
In Latvia the most non-citizens live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga, unresidents living in Latvia 125 344, in Daugavpils 14 266 and Liepājas 11 909.
Outside the big town, Latvian citizens live most in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia without Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, there were 392 816 people who were not nationalized in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to in Facebook: "The citation is a bad reason".
Therefore, I will not look back and try not to remind you of what has been done in the history of rearing human nature and what results have been achieved.
I do not assess whether these tests can be considered successful or failed.
I am also avoiding excessive source references, although I rely on the thought of my most important teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere if I only remember where exactly.
The most spectacular momentum in the current Estonia is the rehabilitation of the Estonian Republic citizen - a perfect person.
We don't raise him like we raise a child... in a good faith that he will become a person.
We raise him as the dominant class imagines it - what one person must be that he can live in Estonia and make a public voice.
The censity is perfect.
Although the local dominant class changed partly a year ago, some methods of rearing are as scary as those of the previous dominant class, now the poored nobles - their brutality will not fall to the least of the past.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a brand for the new era of fine-tuning.
0,5 promilli compulsory for Heads of State
The dominant class includes not only those politicians who get paid for their work from the country, but also those self-conscious people who do their policy on a voluntary basis (list: deliberately): write opinions using Mihkel Mut's image, stalking in Facebook, when fearful people live around them in Estonia, pivoting, boikotizing, juggleting, sabotage.
They agree to be only in echo chamber (the English expression of people living in a room with only their suitable opinions, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but it is not possible in the conflict in Estonia.
There are still some co-roads who think or do something that is unbearable to the people of the house.
And there's a word war open, and the sparkling canoe is raising.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how many people can drink with whom to sleep, give more children how to work, get a lot of pay when to rest, think of what to eat, how to resent when to be sick, how to die.
In very important places.
If their public speeches are confronted with something other than what they said themselves, they have angered, insulted, insulted, in the hystery.
The fact that in many European countries people drive a "full head" car, and that is allowed by law, their opinion will not be twisted.
Null tolerance is the only tolerance allowed in each field, but there is no care behind zero tolerance, but no sink.
Classic shark and racism - only like me fit.
Holy politicians can only open their mouth but never open their hearts.
They believe that every "measure" they make society better is working, working and worth trying.
Fortunately, we have a sufficient scale of map forces under glorious attention of cravings, with spiritual trees, who jump through every window without knowing any pain.
So it seems to us that if a smart farmer opens his mouth, and he is emotionally beaten in the mansion that makes sense.
Some words that surely send us to the mansionhouse are gay, refugees, women, violence, work, etc.
If you believe in everything that selfish officials, activists and politicians (these are only a small part of all groups, but they are able to rob you so that the entire society is complaining), the citizen is not only disgusting, lame and unpleasant, but also brain-free, without brain.
But let us not believe, do not make you tolerate, do not forbid you to drink.
In any case, the Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the country allows.
In any case, the Estonian man will tolerate more than he will be forced to tolerate.
The Estonian man does not change his behaviour two months before the elections to turn his back on the popularity diet and not only in his mouth, but also to expose what discomforts his brain fat kilograms quickly.
Whoever does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be reared.
I think it's possible to teach people.
Drink reasonablely, love your family, be busy, polite, charming companion not only to friends but to society as a whole.
To teach you, you don't have to punish, limit, prohibit, force, call, put a corner, throw it in the media bubble, with rotten eggs.
The teacher must be an example.
A smoking politician is talking about tobacco harm?
A free-time cop makes me a fine for over speeding me?
And then my colleague, with his head in the yomm, will miss...
I have such a slight idea that maybe we should try to rear up the dominant class.
Tell them not to drink secretly.
If you drink, drink publicly: in the place of the raven, in the eyes of the whole people.
To blow the speed only publicly - the rulers' cars, including private cars, be it all red.
If you rule, rule as ye rule yourselves.
Maybe it's enough to be ashamed if words and actions don't come together.
Or we can find out that we want them to rule us the fastest.
Because all of us, the Estonians, are what we don't want to be at all.
Where to run from yourself?
According to the former prosecutors, the leaking of Trump transkriptes is probably a federal crime.
The person who leaked the transkriptes between President Trump and the leaders of foreign countries to the press likely committed a crime, claimed the former prosecutors on Thursday when the lawyers asked the defendant to find out.
"Unauthorised disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former Columbia District Attorney General Joe diGenova Fox News.
These different acts, which include the disclosure of the notes of the discussions between the President and the leaders of foreign countries and their transkriptes, pose a serious threat to national security.
The Washington Post reported on the basis of leaked documents on Thursday new details on the intense speeches of Trump at the end of January with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first place, Trump ordered the Mexican Head of State to terminate the public declaration that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, transkriptes included notes suggesting that they were classified by the Head of the National Security Council.
The Post said that they had reached the complete transkriptes that were "combined by White House employees" and based on the White House records.
"There is a federal law provision that makes such classified information about leakage to an unauthorized person, a federal crime," said former New York State Attorney Doug Burns at the phone interview.
Although some of the details of these calls came to the public already in February, the disclosure of transkriptes indicates a much greater blow to the White House, who is trying to reduce leaks.
The report was published randomly at a time when the Trump Administration's management figures were preparing for the public to be vigorously involved on Friday to show their commitment to the extraction of classified information leaks.
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of the National Intelligence and Security Centre, William Evanina, is expected to be invoked in the head of the Ministry of Justice.
It's not clear whether the Ministry of Justice is investigating the leakage of the Post.
In order to take responsibility for it, Burns said that "secure elements must be clearly proven".
He said, "that's the subject, there may be brutality", referring to the investigation and the decision of the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, not to prosecute.
These considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the event of a secrecy, prosecutors will examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in a way that negatively affects the interests of the United States of America.
"If everything can be proven, people may undoubtedly be in a criminally undefensive situation," said Burns.
"No doubt."
When you talk about the transkriptes of Trumpi's phone calls, DiGenova, who was the prosecutor of spying cases, said that such documents are "normally classified as a secret and higher."
The claim that these leaks threaten the U.S. government's ability to pursue foreign policy is that DiGenova asked the D.A. to invite a federal panel of criminal jury to find leaks.
He also said that to obtain the records of the The Washington Post reporters and editors' phone calls, there should be a court order - that is something the reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
The Utah Republic Senator Mike Lee said on Thursday at Capitol Hill that there should be criminal proceedings to leak classified information.
"We need to find the person who leaked them - he must be punished and he must be fired," said Lee Fox News, "America's News HQ."
"This is unacceptable, and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, said that this leak was a "criminal, very serious federal crime".
"This act should not only involve dismissal, but also criminal proceedings, given that classified information is included," he said.
Fox News was told that, at this stage, the Ministry of Justice could give a Friday notice rather an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve, not explain certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticised and publicly expelled his anger on the prosecutor, claiming that the latter has not made enough effort to find leakages.
"I want the Attorney General to be much more harsh about leaks coming from security agencies," said Trump in roseia on 25 July.
The sessions itself admitted last week to Fox News Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the efforts made to investigate the leakages that have been repeatedly impeded to the President since his inauguration.
"I was not satisfied with previous criminal leaks and investigations," said Sessions.
Even some people who have a critical view of the President have spoken against leaks, saying that such a course is detrimental to foreign policy efforts.
"The leakage of the transscript between the President and the head of the foreign country is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous," David Frum wrote on Thursday in Atlantic.
"It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can respond confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the Senate Security Committee's head Democrat, also told The Daily Beasti that the leak is "absolutely" worrying and the Congress should examine it.
10 sneaky advertising tricks making the appearance of food more attractive
As many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses other ingredients that deceive people, for example, glue or ice cream instead of milk.
The Top Trending of Youtube channel makes an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
If someone opens a popcorn bag in the ad, or takes out a hamburger, a lot of fun steam.
In fact, the take is longer and during this period, hot food does not evaporate because steam comes from a large amount of water that, for example, does not exist in bakery products.
Therefore, cotton balloons that are liquefied in water are placed in the pack or food, with the ability to suck into and keep their share of water.
In the vicinity of the heat, they thrive much longer than the burger or popcorn, and the product becomes freshly manufactured.
Potato pumper is a great auxiliary to photographers because it will not melt with light or heat or significantly alter consistency as many other foods.
For example, the creamy cake may be a potato pump instead of filling or ice-cold ice cream.
Some colours and decorative elements, and the consumer has been deceived again.
The adhesive replaces milk.
It is not easy to photograph milk either, because it may not look so white on the photo.
The foods served with milk are also rapidly diluted inside it.
As, for example, morning flakes or mysles must look crisps and tastes inside the milk, the glue is used instead of milk, which does not pass through any of the pearls.
If restaurants can work hard to make the meat, that the result is juice and quite ripe, it will not be done by advertising.
However, the meat presented in the advertisement looks particularly attractive, as if it came directly from the grill.
Often, however, it is chewed on a ready pan or made in a furnace, and stripes embryoing on the meat with a shoe shoe.
It is as difficult to work with the carpet as ice cream, as it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical to the appearance of foam cream - a beard-shaving wax.
Therefore, it can be advertised on cake or berries or inside a milk cocktail.
Even the top of the fruits sold in the store may have a thin layer of wax that makes their appearance brighter.
However, it is not enough for the photograph, and the deodorant is sprayed on it to add light on the fruit.
The boxes are also not photographic, as they become more fluid or emit water, for example.
Here, however, we need help with wax with bright colors and more persistent textures that allow us to make a tempting self - sauce.
The wax is also likely to be used on pictures where the melting chocolate flows on the top of the cake or ice cream.
If you notice in the advertisement an ideal cut-through cake where the bisquevide and fill-in ratio is perfect, there are probably some extra layers or pieces of cardboard.
That's because when you cut the cake, you can disperse the filler and break the picture.
If after cutting the cake in the boxes and spray them with a filler, it leaves a much more beautiful look visually.
The clip and button needles are also used inside the burger to make sure that all the ingredients there are precisely fixed so that they can stay still.
That's why a burger doesn't look like advertising on the table.
Papered chicken full-toped.
Advertising looks furious, juice and fullman, but it may not even be ready to cook.
In order to add a complete impression, the chicken is filled with paper, if necessary sliced with the potatoes mentioned above and then sprayed on the chicken with the colour of brown.
In particular, the pancakes are poured in American advertising with a foam syrup, because this picture is a big pancake in people.
In fact, the cakes quickly absorb syrup into themselves and the flowing syrup quickly disappears from the photographer's eyes.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a sofa cleaning device that helps to avoid rapid absorption.
Often it does not help, and it is therefore the aid of golden brown engine oil, which is plucked on warm pancakes and presented as a syrup.
Former soldier was convicted of the murder of a suspicious pensioner in sexual abuse.
For at least 17 years, the former soldier was convicted for the murder of a man who he suspected of being abused by a familiar woman.
In June, Richard Cassidy (70) was sentenced to the Supreme Court of Glasgow for the murder of David Farish (75) in his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire is in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called the murder "particularly brutal" because the victim's body had 14 skull wounds.
Consultant Defence Advisor Brian McConnachie said that the killing was caused by "a momentary madness", but he described the circumstances as "unusual".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said he went home to Farish and "friend" with him in hope of hearing a confession, not with a plan to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy showed signs of intention on the day of the attack, and showed a report on social work, which revealed that the defendant had undergone specialist training in the army on how to integrate into groups by friendship.
Farish had not been charged.
The court reported that after the murder Cassidy contacted the police himself and gave up himself.
McConnachie announced that most people have a hard understanding that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said, "He hasn't had any problems before this incident.
He lived in full life until this mad moment in February 2016.'
Cassidy's health is supposed to be poor and he's been caught under arrest with a heart attack and stroke.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what he was allegedly told about Farish when he was imprisoned with a minimum of 17 years of life.
The Scottish police described the case as "a particularly degrading murder in his own home of a man of a poor old man."
Detective David Pinkney said, "Although this punishment does not turn out to be his cruel act, I hope it will provide David's family with some kind of solution."

It is worth knowing how to calculate the amount of sugar in the milk product?
"On the basis of the European Union food labelling standards, the quantity of carbohydrates and sugars which are not equal to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar, can be removed on the packaging," Valio confirmed Krista Kalbin, marketing director of Estonia.
In fact, in milk products there are three types of sugar: lactose in milk, natural milk sugar, glucose in fruit and fructose and added sugar or sucrose in milk.
However, if you bear in mind a few simple basic facts, Kalbin said that the calculation of the quantity of added sugar in the product should not produce difficulties.
Firstly, it must be made clear whether it is a milk or acidified milk product.
The usual milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk sugar, i.e. lactose per 100 gram of product.
In acidified dairy products, yogurt or kefiribacters have consumed part of lactose during the oxygenation process and have therefore been acidified on dairy products for lactose at an average of 3,5g/100g of the product.
"For the calculation of the quantity of added sugar, lactose must first be calculated from the quantity of sugars," said Kalbin.
It is now necessary to calculate fraction and glucose from berries and fruits from the quantity of sugars.
"In general, in the milk product flavoured with fructose and glucose, there are approximately 0.3 grams of fruit in normal 3-4% and, in particular, in products with a fruit content of approximately 15%, up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams," said Kalbin.
According to her, this simple calculation shows that the sugar added may be less than twice lower than the percentage of sugar indicated on the packaging.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different because the sugar content depends on production technology.
Comparison of the most favourable spa packages: out of the nightclub tickets to the sauna rituals
The consumer service of the postman compared the more favourable packages offered by the spa to one person for one night on 11-12 August.
"Spain hotels are at different levels and service choices, so one comparison only on the basis of the price is very difficult", said the OÜ Spa Tours sales manager Mario Sau.
Compared to spa accommodation facilities, the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and the choices are available for a more demanding customer and for a less modest holidayer.
For example, if a passenger alone can spend 51 euros in a single room in the water centre house in Freska Spa with buffet evening meals and breakfast, and with unlimited use of the water park, the gym and the saunas, one person will have a package of 287 euros when visiting the mansion in Muhumaa.
It contains accommodation in the Double Deluxe category room, breakfast restaurant in Alexander's winter garden and "Cororor and moisture" half-day spa package.
By selecting and comparing the different packages, it should be taken into account that the most favourable price should be allowed to leave with a friend or a partner, because in two rooms staying more favourable than having a private room.
However, if there is a desire to rest alone, two-local rooms will be offered to the visitor in accordance with the specific individual vacancies and the extra fee.
If, in general, an uncooperative passenger needs to pay just a €20 premium for staying in a double room alone, there are also more favourable options to make compromises possible.
For example, Fra Mare Thalasso Spas located in Haapsalus pays a package in a single room of 86 euros, but if you wish, you will also offer a more favourable opportunity to stay in a two-digit room, provided that someone else is previously stayed in the room shortages.
In this case, the price of the package will be EUR 58.
It is worth being flexible to get the most advantageous deal.
The prices of the packages are dynamic, perhaps depending on the weekly and fulfillment.
"For the most favourable package, prices may vary from 112 to 248 euros," explained the sales and marketing director of the V SpaHotel, Triinu Steel, located in Tartu.
He also drew attention to the fact that their hotels have a variable price, depending on performance, and added that the customer generally receives the most favourable price, booking directly from their website or asking for the offer itself.
Since the summer period is the fastest for the spas, it is worth planning the holiday in time to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, at the time of comparing the packages, both Pärnu Hedon Spas and Strand Spa have only been selected in the conference hotel and only suites have been sold in the Lahemaa.
You don't have to find a long way to spend a relaxing holiday: one or more spas will soon be found in every city of Estonia.
It is therefore worth examining before buying the package, and at the same time there is no major event in the vicinity, because it raises prices immediately.
For example, until August 11-13, the events of the White Lady will be held in Haapsalus.
At this time Haapsalus is a great deal of tourists, demand for accommodations, and we are in charge of great events at this time.
"We do not have accommodation at the time with the preferential or favourable packages," commented Irene Field, the director of the spa hotel.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia immediately made a turnover of EUR 100 million
Agritera, a Chinese owner of agricultural production, which only started operations last year, reached nearly EUR 100 million.
The profit was earned by almost EUR 2 million, the Business Day writes.
The company’s Annual Report shows that the sales revenues of Agritera OÜ, which were involved in the purchase and wholesale of agricultural products, amounted to EUR 100.6 million in 2016.
The profits were made EUR 1.91 million.
A year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
In the company, the average number of three people worked in the soil, and there were no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, the average gross fee of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest for a whole year, so you don't need to rest.
Of course, it was my fault that this vacation was not resting.
I guess I was also somewhat necessary, but I think I was the only one who thought he was irreplaced.
It's your fault that my chest was sliced by a stupid commitment.
The quote at the beginning of this column is great in order to fully meet the truth.
So it was - the new agency that I started working in March of the same year, but something in this work was so much better for me to recover in three months to a full new life, and I rested.
It's summer, it's vacation time.
It's time to make a new year's promise, look at what's happened in life, and what direction is this whole thing going to be?
"It's Christmas for this and a year's shift." Now a decent citizen calls badly.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas doesn't fit to think about life and set goals.
All right, all I'm saying is for myself. I can't make any changes during the weekend.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, in Christmastime, there is happiness and joy in the warehouse: I like the knowledge of the beginning of the light race, I like Christmas gains, and also Jesus was a very sympathetic attitude, a revolutionary man.
Nevertheless, I am mostly very tired during Christmas and sometimes also stressed - even because of this darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of work living a life without a vacation, maybe more than doing a fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm always resting.
Mostly, I've run like a squirrel on a bike, gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little higher load at work ...
Considering the constant societal pressure in the heart of unconditional joy and peace, the difficulties of Christmas times are obvious.
But despair and a tired person can't make good decisions, but they've long been able to improve their plan.
Such things have to be done more or less with clear heads.
A tired person may throw out an empty and sound promise, which is about as helpful as the future foundation stores buy a lot of lottery tickets.
The promise, which is meant to change something, should be thought slowly through, it should grow, it should be a plan.
The plan, so unlike the promise, also contains the goal of action and does not go broken after a few tiny relapses.
That's why I'm saying that the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to rest calmly and discuss why this fatigue is so big (if it is).
If you don't commit yourself to rattle off the table during the holiday, like the calf, enough for a couple of weeks to find a hook in your life that deserves to be straightened and figure out how it can be done.
I think it's important to live as much as possible, so I don't need a vacation to rest on a regular basis, not once a year.
So the holiday would be an additional laugh, not a box stop for survival, during which you will be loaded as much as you will ever be able to endure the next year.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time next morning, then get some sleep in the evening.
I believe that if every tenth Postman reader listened to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be considerably better.
I'm going to follow my advice.
We're already on a Thursday working week, but not what we expect.
Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have their own unidentified desired Thursday work week.
But not as they expect, Business Day writes.
It has been created by a modern workspace planning, or an open office.
According to Harvard Business Review, employees will need nearly 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full day a week.
However, if four working days and three holidays are considered under the Thursday working week, this forced solution is worse than that.
1.5 hours of work taken with the family and instead of a reconstruction period spent with horses or holidays, the focusing difficulties, the mixing of work, increasing irritation and anxiety, and the disappearance of jobs.
The third festival day of the week is sent by a strong wind.
That's how the night-page photographer left a cavalry in trouble trying to fly in the wind.
Because of the windy weather, many festival visitors also admit that their mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built his daughter a 51 million dollars theme park
One of the fathers in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabilityd daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on his family vacation when his 12 - year - old daughter Morgan approached other kids playing water.
He tried to be friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they're freaked out because they don't know how to treat people with disabilities -- Morgan has a cognitive understanding of five years and a certain form of autism.
The incident left to haunt him.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to the mouth, and he is undoubtedly willing to hug.
But there have been many times where we have not been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his wife Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter, somewhere where he would feel comfortable and others would also feel good in dealing with him.
"We came to the conclusion that there is no such an inclusive place," Hartman says.
He therefore decided to build it itself in 2007.
The former real estate developer sold its homebuilding companies in 2005 to set up the Gordon Hartman Family Foundation - a non-profit association that helps people with disabilities.
Then he started creating the first "the world's first most accessible theme park".
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything that can play with both special needs and no special needs," Hartman says.
He invited doctors, therapists, parents, and other people with disabilities and disabilities to consult on the facility.
They were set up a ten-hectare abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
The park named Morgan's Wonderland paid $34 million (pound 26 million) and was opened in 2010.
Attractions include a fully accessible spectacle, adventure playing field and mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with specially designed wheelchair wagons that move up and down next to the animals.
Hartman, however, admits that Morgan was afraid of driving at the beginning.
"When we opened, he didn't dare go on it.
He didn't understand why it was going around and why the animals were moving up and down," says Hartman.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
"Always he was just standing close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he loves driving it.
Getting away from something that frightened him meant a lot to him.
When playing, the little things that have been accomplished make a big difference."
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has visited over a million people in 67 countries and all 50 American states.
A third of the staff is disabled and entry is free of charge for all who have a condition.
"I thought Morgan was one of the happy ones because he has a lot of things he needs.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," Hartman says.
"We open every year, knowing that we will remain at least a million dollars (£750 000) in losses, and we must earn it back with the help of collectors and partners."
This year, the theme park was expanded by opening a fully accessible water park in Morgan's Inspiration Island.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set aside a water park," Hartman says.
In some islands, warm water has been used to help people with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorised wheelchairs are available that operate with pressure pressure, not battery.
It's also possible to ride a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of 17 million dollars (pound 13 million).
" Yesterday, a man came to me inspiration Island and just kept me out of hand," Hartman says.
"He pointed to his son, who has serious special needs, and started crying.
He said his son hadn't been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three of the four visitors in each park have no trees, and the park has the effect he hoped.
"This will help people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl without special needs, and they started playing together.
It was really awesome."
Hartman has no intention of opening more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by post and by e-mail from people who would like to go to a park in his neighborhood.
Instead, he focuses on providing educational facilities to young people with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organisations trying to build something similar elsewhere in Morgan's Wonderland, and we will continue to cooperate with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to play the theme park - Morgan is now a kind of celebrity there.
"If he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he'll be able to handle it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, who's 23 now, can do things better.
"He now speaks more and most of his physical problems have resolved with a number of operations.
We're so proud that he's reached this far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play the most chimney and sand, without wondering how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows that the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed life," Hartman says.
"He doesn't understand how he's handled things in his life has made him a real source of inspiration."
Head coach of the U18 group Vaido Rego: Play-off game may be decided by one or two
In the Estonian U18-class basketball convenience, the Estonian EMI B division was defeated in the quarterfinal of Poland 68:63, according to head coach Vaido Rego, a real play-off meeting.
The game was creepy.
Both teams had done their homework, the points have come hard.
The game comes by a fact with better nerves.
Play-off could be a one-to-two whiskey game," discussed Rego.
Yes, but the coach is still looking for what to fix.
She's always giving me a nurse.
Some of our mistakes were unjustified, the opponent received mild freelances and lived on them.
That's what we've done before -- if you're going to protect aggressively, there's a risk to exaggerate.
Let's make our conclusions," said Rego.
He used nine players today, and Robin Kivi, who left behind because of some injuries, was still on the ping.
These decisions are taking place running.
The stone brought the morning training and the pre-game warmth, but it was still not ready at a hundred percent," explained the instructor.
Tomorrow at 6:15 meets the UK in the Estonian semifinal, who defeated Bulgaria today 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise its country's U18 age class for the next summer of EM's A division.
Video: Vassiljev created a new club for another penalty
The Pia stayed in the game at the homefield for nine minutes against Wroclawi Slaski, but he was able to delay 20 minutes later.
Vassiljevi was a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the season for Piasti.
Four minutes before the normal time was completed, half-defense and punishment passed.
The match ended with 1:1 fig.
In Pia, two points have been gathered in four rounds and is located in the league table at the last, or 15.
How do you keep sex excited if you're trying to have a baby?
It is therefore very important to keep the cherry ripping even if you are trying to create a new life.
The first woman advises how to do sex doesn't seem annoying.
Don't take it as an obligation.
This could happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes pregnancy may take years.
The command to have sex takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they can't enjoy "normal" sex at the end of the cycle if they know that there's no positive result.
This creates tensions in relation, which in turn leads to a reduction in sex and less sex, of course, means even more opportunity not to become pregnant.
But men feel that they have to be able to "maintain" when they're required.
If you know your fruitful days in advance, it can help you plan something romantic with your dearest.
Let's have a special dinner or just spend time together - enjoy each other!
Take a fruitful period into account.
From a reproduction point of view, there is no point in having sex when the ovulation has taken place, but in order for your relationship to be delicious, try to have sex in days that are not fruitful because of the pleasure.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy would take place more certain than she can get an orgasm, don't forget it!
Remember, each couple is different.
Everyone's gonna be able to handle the baby's stress differently.
Some men want to be aware of the woman's cycle, others prefer not to know that they do not feel pressure on "requirement."
No one knows better than you did, how you're best suited.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that the higher success is for couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can keep that density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you as a couple best.
IAAF warns that fraud is being watched sharply at London World Championships
On Friday, the World Championships of the Slight Power will begin in London, and sportsmen will be in connection with doping channels more than ever.
These World Championships are the first to be watched by a new body, Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and counterfeiting of results.
"It is not possible to rule out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
We can say, however, that we have the best practice and the best anti-doping programme that can be at all on the basis of information and data collection, and we see the result after the event," said David Howman, the AIU representative.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete with about 190 Russian athletes who have missed drogs as neutral athletes.
Follow-up: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team at the homefield
Levadia has put himself in a difficult position, because in the previous round the strangers were surprisingly lost to the future of Viljandi, and the table leader Flora used the opportunity offered, slipping away seven points.
On the back, the same stick as Levadia has reached Nurse Rock.
Paide, who confined during the summer transition window, continues to miss the captain and the mid-outer Andre Frolov.
In the last seven games, only two fig points have been picked, the eighth table is on the table - the Tartu Tammekast is four points down and the future is four points ahead.
In Levadiale, Paide lost Paide in the first game between 0:7 and 2:5.
"My clock died, but I didn't," the actress Raivo E. Tamme shined in the face of Ironman 70.3 in the finish of a wide smile.
True, during the whole half-long triaton, the smile didn't even leave Raivo behind.
And more, running about 21,1 kilometres, he got into a conversation: "I was talking to a man during the run, and one man ran by and wondered, "Lord, you're still able to talk!"
At the runway, Raivo, who had a division of energy to talk even, went over a few times on a quick call.
Coach's recommendation.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that the mountain should walk, that there is no point in pushing to run, because here are such risings and there is no particular difference in time whether you run or do the quick walk," says an actor that took the triatleet instructor’s advice to hear.
At the same time, he was able to breathe the time of walking, and after crossing the finish line, he was able to share an interview without breathing to the left and right.
It's like there's no one behind the back of a nine-mile swim, 90 kilometers of bicycle rides and 21,1 kilometers of run.
"I think my training is also the kind that I can enjoy this competition," admits he started training in January, and today he lost 16 kilograms of his weight in Raivo's satisfaction.
And as far as the interviews are concerned, it was my wish that I could do my interviews after the final interviews.
After every competition, I've been able to interview and I was hoping it would be great to cope after Otepää Ironmani.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn't on the ground after Ironman. On the contrary, Raivo's final line was offered a whole different picture: his hands were victorious to the sky and his true victory in the face.
There was also reason: Raivol took 1,9 kilometres to swim 46 minutes and 24 seconds, 90 kilometres for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21,1 kilometres for 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart has now been given to triatlon," confirms Raivo, who already called at finiś, that he gave a finger to sport, and it took the ring in the back.
I already registered on August 20, Gran Fondole - 230 miles from Tallinn to Tartu with a bike!
So tomorrow's workout again!
Disney's long-term advisor and manager Marty Sklar died when he was 83 years old.
Sklar, who died in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood of Los Angeles on 27 July, maintained contacts with the company after retirement in 2009, which was exactly scheduled for Disneyland's opening to the 54th anniversary.
Last year, he became the only member of Shanghai Disney on the opening day of China (so the company invites his employees) who have participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before he died, he attended Disney's fans' meeting in D23, sharing memoirs about Disneyland.
His death was reported by Disney Company, not to mention the cause.
She was 83 years old.
The post of Sklar as editor of the Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after the U.C.L.A. in 1956, to work in this advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's main shadow author in writing advertising materials, dedications, souvenir leaders, speeches, loosungs, presentations and short films, such as a copy that helped the company to accept the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"They were quite headlined times for a person who was near only his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years of college graduating," Sklar wrote in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite Walt Disney's trust in Sklari's writings, he appointed Sklari in the 1964 New York World Chair Ford's pavilion, where Disney Company was designing exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote Walt Disney a story of Ford's pavilion for Magic Skyway, where he could have seen animatronic dinosaurs and cave names, which was their main link with large corporate sponsors.
It was the beginning of Sklar's second view in the company.
He was increasingly associated with Walt Disney's successor, who died at the end of 1966 for a while before Walt Disney World was opened in 1971 and Epcot in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar became rewritten in the burning world when they told him that the managers of the company had not prepared a public speech, although "it wasn't a secret that Walt was dying", as he writes in his autobiography.
According to Sklar, he felt annoying that he had to write a statement on which Roy Disney would sign, but he realized that the incomplete planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company's leaders.
"In fact, they were all scared to death," Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Jersey, New Brunswick.
His father Leon was a teacher and mother, a girl named Lilyn Fuchs, worked at Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach California when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had several temporary jobs, for example, worked in Douglas Aircraft, as an ice cream squad drive-in as a hamburger restaurant as well as as as as a postal transporter.
But in May 1955, when his third year in U.C.L.A. was ending, Sklar received a message to call Disney's marketing and advertising manager E. Cardon Walker.
At that time, Sklar was a new editor of the student newspaper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to the newspaper The Disneyland News for a job interview for the creator and editor.
Walker said the theme park would be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
But Sklar had to prove to Walt Disney that he knows what he's doing.
"I had worked there for two weeks, and I had to present Walt Disney a page concept," he recalled at the Disney Avenue web site in the pocket broadcast.
"If Walt hadn't liked it, he would have thrown me out of the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked on a professional level."
Sklar formed Walt Disney (and some other people) lessons at one time as a manifest of "Mike's Ten Command", or the theme park board.
The commands include, for example, the following.
Try to "behave in visitors' shoes" to experience the attraction like them.
There's only one story at a time for each of the tractions.
Bob Rogers, the topical entertainment expert, called Sklar's time as a "borrower's student" - the role Miki-Hiir played in Disney's "Fantasia" (1940) - because he had mediated Disney's philosophy to three designers' generations.
The Sklarist leaves her husband, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard and four grandchildren.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
He regularly wore three laped Miki-Hirre watches (which showed him the time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and Miki-Hire gold rings.
And he never forgot something Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the childhood area of the California Adventure Park, Sklar reminded the planners that they would add to the activities that parents and children could jointly do, as Walt Disney had requested.
"I remembered everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt had the habit of taking his daughters to drive to Diane i and Sharont Griffith Park with carousel," he said to The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and daddy had to sit on the parkping and eat peanuts and popcorn until the kids drove alone."
Police took over 200 people to the station during the week.
In total, more than 20 crimes were registered in Pärnu during the festival days.
There is a reason to link about half of them to the musical party; alongside the use of violence, a large number of drug possessions were registered and two drinking managements were recorded.
A hundred of the offences initiated were mainly related to the use or possession of minors or prohibited substances consumed by alcohol.
There was a letter of thieving and a violation of public order.
For various reasons, regulars brought over 200 people to the police station.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and mostly the cause of delivery to the police station was alcoholic beverages.
The bubble had more than half of the minors brought to the station.
Kainenema was also taken by half a hundred people, perhaps as much as last year.
The above figures are expected in view of the great crowd, as stated by Andres Simmer, head of Pärnu Police Department.
As in the previous years, we had been thoroughly prepared for this weekend.
We brought back additional forces from other prefectures, police police departments and emergency police forces to ensure that we are ready to react quickly.
Most of the situations were solved by a word and sufficient communication of regularists with citizens.
"Of course, there were so many bad things left behind because the police were in the city to see and feel enough in our opinion," said Siimeri.
His opinion was extremely positive that the young people who were drinking alcohol were less visible and that the youths proved to be able to celebrate.
He commended the top-level security team of the security company who took care of security in the festival.
I thank all the festival visitors who held up and celebrated safely.
"At the same time, thanks to the local residents who contributed to the successful event of the big festival with their understanding attitude," said the police leader.
In Pärnu's police station, owners are waiting for the items found in the city and festival area during the weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, the director of Pärnu's service who was responsible for the return of the findings at the festival, there were fewer items lost this year than the bull.
At the festival police station, the owners were returned on the run from half of the findings.
The most lost bank cards, ID documents, mobile phones and keys were three days.
"Now there are 13 other mobile phones at the station, three wallets, laptop, nuts and several car keys", listed Pärna.
The 101-year-old man jumped off the plane.
The veteran of World War II, Verdun Hayes, recently received a military reward to celebrate the parachute hypnotized by his world record.
In particular, the man performed a rape at age 101 and 38, making it the oldest parachute jumper in the world.
The business group urges the government to agree on the transitional terms of Brexit
One of the largest groups of business lobbyists in Britain urges the government to stop dancing around the Brexit area.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) asked the government to go out with a "transition contract" to make progress with Brexit smooth.
It is hoped that the government would re-establish the "Brexit salmon" bridge between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, business is facing a "short-term chaotic cliff fluctuation".
They criticised the government for the involvement of the "transition in all kinds of speculative disputes".
In recent weeks, members of the government have given controversial views on how long the transition period is going to last and what it will bring with it.
In the IoD report, the silence of the Brexit gap - the options for the transition - says: " Instead of a far-reaching approach to the problem, the government must re-engage this issue with a strategic debate.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economic scientist and a group of Economists for Brexit, described this week's concern about "cliff-serving" Brexit as "the talk of panic scientists" that reminds Y2K's computer programming error of fear in the exchange of the millennium.
Earl General Philip Hammond warned in June: "There are a large number of business investments that are delayed until companies see more clearly what is the likely result of these discussions."
Allie Renison, head of IoD EU and trade policy, said: "The Chancellor has the right to worry about delaying business investments.
This is one of the most frequent changes that need to be dealt with in relation to Brexit, alongside the EU relocation of operations.
The latter applies in particular to IoD members located in Northern Ireland who are currently considering a joint placement or relocation."
IoD offers a number of options, including the following: extension of Article 50 Agreement from March 2019
Accession of the European Economic Area
Conciliation to remain in the government of EU legislation longer
Establishment of a Transitional Customs Agreement similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "IoD offered in connection with the transition of these opportunities, hoping that it would be sparkling an appropriate debate on how best to complete Brex.
Priority of interim arrangements and thereby mitigating risks to exit from the EU means that short-term katotic cliff fluctuations do not decrease future opportunities."

The Russian railway is exploring the possibility to run the Berlin-Peterbur train line through Kaliningrad, announced Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad, the Director of the Kaliningrad railway.
Travel monitoring says that from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to refute the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we're offering another route to Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterbur.
Technical opportunities for this are available in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock," said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also pointed out that there are already Russian trains that can change track width and continue to move on the European track width.
Golomolzin believes that this direction is prominent, because today the inhabitants of St. Petersburg and the whole of Russia in the northwest must travel through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible variant, the route will be discussed through Latvia, confirmed the Latvian Delfile on the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzceļš) pressman Māris Ozols, who said that there is no specific decision at present, but the option is discussed.
The Latvian railway, together with the partners, including the Russian railway, is looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in the service of passenger traffic, so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistan's prices in India can't find asylum
70 years after the biggest population migration in the history of two countries has begun, prices are still moving from Pakistan to India.
There are already tens of thousands of people who are not even legally entitled to work in India at the borders of the two countries.
Thus, many do not have any choice but illegally bend near temporary habitats in stone fractures - on the one hand, the Indian authorities are monitoring the movements of the aliens on the other hand very sharply.
Most of the arrivals from Pakistan cannot wait for such an reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
That's where we worked on the fields, we were farmers.
Here, however, we are forced to serve as ours to break stones," said 81-year-old Jogdas.
For us, the division is not over.
Prices are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an old man living in the field camp near the town of Jodhpur.
After India’s independence, over 15 million people lost their home under the British colonial power in 1947.
The separation caused a monthly wave of violence that lost lives by at least a million people because of religious anger.
In the midst of the blood chaos, Hinds and Sikhs were fleeing from Pakistan, but the Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite migration, prices are still one of the more numerous minority groups in Pakistan.
In different estimates, they account for around 1.6% of the 200-million population in the country.
Many of them complain about discrimination and fear of kidnapping, rape and forced lives.
"Retreat started soon after the resignation", said Jogdas, whose family moved only a few months before the two countries were breaking up to escape from the drought to the current Pakistani regions.
It wasn't the day we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live my prices in the midst of my brothers.
The National Government of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mod has said that it wishes to make it easier to find asylum in India for religious reasons.
Last year, the government started to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship in their place of residence, and the whole business was previously carried out through the central government.
The prices relocated from Pakistan to India will be open after seven years of residence in the country to obtain an opportunity to obtain an emergency citizenship.
Due to bureaucratic delays, however, this process is often much more time-consuming.
Khanaramji, 64 years old, left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian citizenship in 2005.
However, many have said that they have abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not expected to live a good life in India.
The government does not provide any support.
We're like cattle without the owner.
We're just trying to survive on our own," said Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism of authorities.
Those who do not have nationality must suffer from harassment of intelligence agencies.
They're always treated as suspects and Pakistan's agents," he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who was committed to helping prices in Jodhpur from Pakistan, had made great expectations for Mod in 2014, but has now had to be disappointed.
During the Mod government, tensions between India and Pakistan have grown and that is why the migrates suffer the most.
"These lives become hell," said Sodhal.
For many, however, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji, with two adult sons, fled to India two years ago, because he had started to get murder threats from his neighbors in Pakistan.
"To save our lives, we had to escape to India," said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from the present areas of India, but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country broke.
My grandfather moved the other way after work.
But he told us we'd move to India at the right time because he knew that the future could become a threat to the Hindu.
I think we've been doing pretty well.
We've done well with our work and our work," says Andres Simon, the head of police in Pärnu, how the first two days of the Week have evolved for them.
Simer says that still today there are patrol police and high-speed agents on the streets, and they also communicate with people - perhaps they have questions and want to know how to become a high-speed agent.
In two days, the police have been forced to deal with some fights and drugs.
"There have also been a few large quantities of drug treatments, but we'll summarise when Weekend is over," says Simer.
There have been about a hundred people in Pärnu's police station over two days.
Fortunately, it was not necessary for the police to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Simer says that when the sky comes sharp and horizontally to rain, they don't have much work.
One of the Haapsalu police field leaders has ever said that rain is like an extra patrol.
Pärnu's police have also done a station in the Weeken, where you can take the things you found, and you can ask for your missing things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary widgets that the good people delivered to the inventory point.
Look at the video Andres told the Simmer Evening page.
A number of Emmy's nominations from the scener and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for the home in Hollywood Hills West, whose roots reach the atomic time.
In the modern style of the mid-century of this century, the building was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and called it the original owners of Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter of nuclear weapons.
The 255 square metres house on the front of a restricted entrance route with gates has wide glass slices that open to the garden, terrace and the inner courtyard.
In the living and dining room, there are floor coverings of the cork, the camel and the portable panels that open the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house in Kinnistu, where the view opens up to the giant fishing trip and the sleeping veranda.
There is also a bathroom and an additional storage room in a separate building.
Albert Wohlstetter was a powerful nuclear strategy during the cold war.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of the intel on incidents prior to Pearl Harbor's attack was also quoted by the investigative committee on 11 September.
Wohlsters have advised the Presidential Administrations of both Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.
They received the President's Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is most well-known for his work in telegraphs in the name of the "Chire Hospital" and "In the name of the Law, a research unit for sexual crimes".
Real estate agents were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez from Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew a perfect image of itself above the United States.
Pilot took a passenger plane to a cyclic state-wide airplane over the United States and even managed to have some fun on the route.
In the real time of the aircraft, the data indicated that it was not just a straight line or a curve, but a series of routes, which formed the image of a plane.
According to Flightradar 24, Flightradar Flight BOE004 left Seattle from Boeing Field Airport at local time about 15.40 on Wednesday.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the direction of the east of Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before changing the course steadily and flew southwest.
In view of the map, the strange route of the plane represents a two-engine passenger plane.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the 18-hour "resistance test" of the aircraft.
" Instead of flying with any pattern, the test team released its imagination, travelling on a route, from which 22 state to 787-8 contours were formed," said the Boeing Company representative of the portal RT.com.
"Dreamliner's nose refers to the Puget Sound region where Boeing Commercial Airplanes is home.
The wings range from North Michigan to the border of Canada to South Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing's long-distance landing aircraft 787-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009.
The plane accommodates up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometres.
Since the pilot used the radar as a personal jaw, the flight on the website was of utmost interest among the aircraft trackers.
Some suspected it was a test flight, others once again suggested that this could be a strange coincidence.
Multifilms affecting the dressing style of Estonian children
If children in Europe and America are often shaped by the children of royal families or fames, Estonian parents choose their clothes on the basis of what is happening on the quinolina.
The British little Prince Georgi is becoming a mother, the Duchess Cahterine, a real mould.
Like his mother, the prince can fire a real purchasing in people with his clothes, which has even received a separate concept of Prince George's effect.
A few weeks ago, the last such adventure took place at a visit to the royal family in Poland, where George wore ten euros of the Spanish brand in Tizza, a blue-red stripe shirt, which the mad parents bought out of the brand's e-shop in 24 hours.
They probably didn't have much amongst them, because our parents are supposed to be completely cold by the children of the kings.
The Commercial Manager Anna Ansmitt acknowledges that the children of the stars and foreign fashions in general do not affect the purchases of our parents to their muds.
In Estonia, the purchase of child affairs is the largest indicative of films, cartoons and Youtube channels.
This is how the most popular products of the last few years are fingerguards, cartoons with "Frozen" characters, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peeling penguins and so on."
At the same time, he confirms that in Estonia, if you wish, your children can be dressed like the princess of Europe.
The Centre is not recommended for the Savi Island Preparation Association
The leaders of the Environmental Regions overseas Estonia have made a call to the public and political partners, which is invited to vote in favour of the Environment, not of the Electoral Unions.
In particular, this message is intended for those who are considering the Electoral Union of the Edgar Savi Island and the Central Region.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think about Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing I've ever seen is an eyewave.
A girl's blue when she was younger.
Later, fat black waveline in his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, whose effect was devastating when he looked up the thick lipstick, bringing the hearing to the immortal phrase: "We were in this marriage three, so it was a little too crowded."
The big and wet eyes surrounded by his choking, pale in the face with a thick black line left the impression of the wounded animal.
That's the effect he was trying to achieve.
But Princess Diana never wore much makeup outside the public, at least not according to modern standards.
It wasn't just that he needed it - he was beautiful, of course - but he saw an annoying commitment in it, something related to work rather than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could have wore thick makeup layers.
Once he arrived at Conde Nast, Vogue's publishers' office, wearing a thick, almost orange shaving cream layer.
He apologized for saying that his skin must shine from the sun, because if he went out "normally", he'd take pictures of him and then put all the charges that he would look like "damaged", "sick" and "tired".
That's why Diana visited solarium three times a week using a machine in his home.
Today, such a course would be bad for health reasons, but for Diana, it was a useful goal - that allowed him to show the world his sunset, although his inner body filled with black clouds and lightning.
One of the greatest mistakes in the royal family was likely to think that if they approve of him as a husband of Charles, they will have a beautiful family memory of a small sugar wax in their brains.
However, the reality was the opposite.
He may not have been the best in school, but if it was about the creation of an image, he was even a five-year-old student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and make-up was that they could be used to convey mood or hours.
Otherwise, they didn't give him any interest.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was his youngest child's godmother - remembers that the makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I remember only this," he said, "How much relieved he felt when we went to rest together and he didn't have to makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves the look of a woman, but when looking back to Diana's lifecycle, it is clear that she used it as a powerful tool for relations.
The moments when he felt the most free was his own, the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, he and his two young sons in the park of Thorpe in the Loggers Leap attraction he was swept through and laughed with his heart, scattered under the eyes of the eye like any other mother who spends the day with the children.
Four months after he and Charles were reported to leave, he finally looked troublingly worryless and "normal".
Or in later years, by shouting out of the training room, hair set back, shaped legs in bicycle pants, faces of training, health and vitality exploding from each of his poor.
To the end of his life, when he began to pay for his independence, and his confidence grew, we saw more and more like that of Diana.
He tied himself to Halo Trust and walked through Angola minefield in January 1997.
At that time, at the age of 35, the hair is soft and natural, the face is almost entirely make-free, he probably looked more beautiful than ever, reminding this bright and hopeful young girl who smiled at a fifteen-year-old engagement photograph.
Diana was just getting to her best years.
In the early days, young Diana Spencer had a dream-looking Raffael nature.
But it didn't take long until the "principalisation" process started, which was primarily controlled by the press and palace to make a young lady refined from Diana who would be worth his new position.
Partly, it included Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist, whom Lord Snowdon used often in photographic sessions, handwork.
Howard met the fearful Diana for the first time at the Kensington City Hall of Snowdon to record the official engagement picture for Vogue magazine.
At that point, at the end of the 1980s, Diana was just an empty mouthpiece.
His finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's shaving cream with a Sheer Genius tone of Honey Touch and Max Factor's chest stick tone of Frosted Coral.
On the eyebrows, he carried a table color with a white bum effect on Elizabeth Arden Rice and Timberland and the eyebrow.
Elizabeth Arden's blue pendant shower and blue contour pencil improved its appearance.
And we know all this because Howard created a face scheme for him.
"Diana's eyes are so admirable in color that I wanted to emphasise their astonishing blueness," he later wrote.
But the final result is not particularly attractive for a young girl - she looks like a 18-year-old who's getting 50.
His eyebrows are too oppressive and too much boring brown in the eyes.
But the most stunning one here is the unfamiliar eyewave on the inside of the eyebrow in the blue tone of this twisted Princess Disney.
Fantasy for a fantasy bride.
Well, then, there's no wonder why Diana is looking at us a little bit insecure.
One source of Diana's push was that he never knew where the public person ends and begins with a private.
It was the beginning of this process.
The person who probably most influenced Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today’s makeup world.
The artist, who is currently Chanel's ambassador, is still one of the magic icons of the world.
"Diana was an incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
Men loved him.
He was sexy without trying to do it."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Vogue's voice chief Anna Harvey asked her to make Diana a makeup before the December photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, the most expensive photographer in a magazine.
The team was also part of a hairdresser Sam McKnight.
This was when Diana and Charles were the greatest in marriage, and the division began in the name of public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," Greenwell said.
"When we got there, Diana just stood there beautifully, was warm and friendly and extremely excited to be the front of Vogue."
This cover picture - Diana's simple black sweater, chin on his hands, his blue eyes are bright, his nails elegant French manicure, hair cut short - was fractured.
It radiated positive, individuality and elegantity.
Above all, it was modern, giving forward the early nineties clanized minimalist aesthetics and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, who stood up to "dose horribilis", as the queen later called it.
"Diana was very stressless about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," said Greenwell.
During time, he taught Diana himself to make a makeup - cream, grinding cream, hidden sticks to raise eyes, ripsmetuš - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging him to take good care of himself and follow the mantra "inner beauty".
Diana "made everything moderately," says Greenwell.
He slept enough and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for the skin with a fresh look.
The princess preferred Guerlain's juice cream, Clarins' lipsticks and Clinique's Wild Rose's cheeks.
But the greatest favor that Mary did to Diana was to take her out of a blue wave of eye.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on the pendant line that was melted, so that all the edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he used just to produce cream and a little sunblood to highlight Diana’s healthy shine.
"Dianal used to call me and invite me to discuss the products I liked to do," Greenwell said to me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; the opportunity to take a few moments for himself."
His favorite was a luxury mark in Clarins.
Diana allegedly used day- and night cream for their sensitive skin and cleaning milk and tooneers with these Alpine herbs.
He also attended the beauty hall of Janet Filderman, Central London.
Diana had a famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had roses, moderate chest rash, which is often due to stress.
In order to mitigate it, he used natural relieved oils, including kibuvitsa oil.
"Diana had an amazing bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance that he wasn't very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey reminds me: "One time when the newspapers wrote that he had been on the nose at the beauty surgery, he turned to me and said, "Fuckfully, if I had let my nose operate, do you think I would have chosen this?"
When Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight's advice began to reach out, Diana felt more and more confident about her new look.
One of his most memorable public interventions in the Serpentine gallery in London in 1994, where he was wearing a famous "management suit", an exemplary of Christina Stambolian with naked shoulders - shows that the signing style of his life began to develop.
Diana is simultaneously sexy and dynamic, his short hair in sharp contrast with a very appealing black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - adorable, but modest, black eyewave highlighting his eyes' blueness.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he was wearing a shiny red candle, quite likely Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some sense.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure in the dismantling of the childhood fund in the Royal Teaching College.
The princess was a benchmark for health and self-confidence.
And finally, he had complete control.
In suffocated and shaped, his makeup without mistake, he will give you exactly what he wants to think about: here is a woman who finally seems to have self-esteem and purpose in life, and who has finally found his place after 36.
It's really a pity that he couldn't prove it to himself.
South Japan is preparing for the taifuun Noru arrival
A large part of the southern Japan, including the areas that were devastated last month by rainbows, made up even more rain on Friday than the strongest storm in the world one of these days, moved closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorology Office, strong winds and a lot of rainfalls in the south of the southern island of Kyushu and about 1350 km from Tokyo are likely to rain up to 800 mm.
The representative of the Meteorology Agency said that Noru, which marks some kind of deer in Korean, will then probably turn north and rain through Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit last month by rainbows and floods that killed 36 people and left four missing, are likely to be saved from the worst.
"This is extremely slowly moving storm," he added, noting that there is a greater flood risk, because in one area it rains a lot over time.
The novel, which was at one point in the category 5 taifun and is an ordinaryly long-term storm, was first formed two weeks ago and swirled by the bike along the northern Pacific, before he headed to the northwest, targeting Japan and weakening his approach.
The representative added that, depending on the change in course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then along the island of Honshu in Japan, but it is still difficult to identify a longer-term journey.
There are places in the countryside where, if necessary, normal vehicles are not easily accessible to the best will.
There's the solution to the ATV.
The ATVs that are in use in the military field gave an overview of the Defense Home!
There is nothing new about the use of such lightweight and high-powered vehicles in military structures.
The need for them was raised in the course of World War II, but more attention was given to them a decade later.
Simplity and Strength
As early as 1956, Willys rolled out of the factories under the mechanical noise called M-274 from a vehicle designed for evacuation of wounded persons during the end of World War II.
Further development is somewhat strange to say about mechanical mule.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Platform with wheels, seats and wheels: all, luxury.
It's as if the league designers had taken the drawings from the engineer's desk too fast and started production fast.
However, in the war, the comfort is much more inferior.
In this category there was no opponent of the mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam.
A mild, less than five hundred kilograms of machine was able to touch them in places where Willyse Jeep, who received mythologically supertransmitting, had to show surrendered brake lights.
Vehicles with a load of approximately 500 kilograms were largely used for transport, both for the transport of munition and for the transport of viable power.
On the other hand, lighter, unresistant tankguns were also installed with the mule.
The driver was able to move the steering system forward in the last emergency and let it be so low that the vehicle was able to be driven in the stomach while lying.
The museums were produced until 1970, together with 11 240, and were in use in the army until 1980, when they exchanged a race against the HMMWVs.
The following two decades had a marginal meaning in the ATV military circles.
They came back to the picture after the dust twins fell in New York, and the US soldiers found themselves mading on Iraq and Afghanistan's desert landscapes.
Just there was the knowledge and understanding that there was a need to fill a gap between the Humwee and the Footwear.
Since the ATV does not generally provide a significant protection, they are not the best choice to perform the battle missions.
However, fast and light machines are suitable to perform special tasks.
Intelligence and rescue operations, for example.
There are now thousands of ATVs and UTVs in the American Army.
Most of them, such as XUV550dk purchased to the Defence Union, are essentially similar to those in civil traffic but complemented in line with the needs of the army.
The names of the trade marks that have received the trade marks on the back of the chamberflazi have been represented, such as the models of the manufacturer of Kawasak Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and the constantly expanding selection of the manufacturer of the leading militia-ATVs.
In 2013, Polaris concluded a five-year contract with the US Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year agreement on MV850s produced on the basis of one-local Polaris Sportsman, having both infrared and black-out lights and innovative beekeeping tyres, which also ensures mobility after 50-caliber weapons hit.
Before MV850 came into the market, Polaris was able to deliver vehicles MV700 and MV800 to the military.
In the case of MV700, they have been made for civil use in Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, a two-part fuel tank for the crossing of larger distances, a reinforced framework and base, and some military equipment, which does not have more than that for farmers or hunters in the same forest.
In the same way as the John Deere M-Gators successfully used in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is equipped with weapons firearms, baggage trucks and some other elements that are useless in the ranch, but in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kilos can carry almost its weight, namely, 570 kilograms of goods.
The engine’s power is also sufficient for the transport of lighter trailers and tyre parts.
In the rear-section box with variable shapes, the sides of which can be removed, the baggage of point A(B) which is larger than the size of this small, but less than the insect.
Later, M-Gatori supplemented versions A1, which are 20 horsepowers more powerful than the original 20-horse M-Gator, and subsequently reinforced A2, which are even better for the transport and hiking of difficulties, and A3, which combine A1 and A2 positive properties.
The M-Gators were actually received in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where the medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the burden of soldiers moving on their own legs by carrying goods that would otherwise have had to be loaded.
If most of the ATVs in force structures are modifications to vehicles used for civil use, there are also some exceptions.
These are the most outstanding war raids made in Phoenix International, which have been successfully used throughout the world in all kinds of battle, intelligence and rescue missions.
The manufacturer argues that they have been introduced for the first time ten years ago and that they have overcome the narrowing points for special operations, which are characterised by conventional ATVs and those which have been modified by the army, both in terms of steering, resilience and safety.
Being built and externally similar to the usual ATV, Prowler is totally different from its design and capacity.
He is faster, more durable, stable and can both carry and bear greater difficulties than other similar vehicles.
For example, if a normal ATV driver has to keep the vehicle steady with his body position and use both hands for manoeuvring, speeding and braking, the driving of Prowler is more like driving the car.
At the end, however, it doesn't matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or any other ATV or UTV concepts and the area of use are similar.
And it is clear that in circumstances where the cost of protection is widely tried to reduce the stock and in place of a wide range of conventional wars, a small-scale, target-oriented sushi is being carried out, lightweight and fast small vehicles joined the army in order to remain in service.
Delicate data of vulnerable children were published as a result of the department’s prosperity
As a result of an aggravating breach of the information, the mother of a child was wrongly sent to the mother of children under care, including information on whether they were sexually active.
The mother was sent with an e-mail table containing the names, dates, locations, and specific concerns and points of attention for all children under the care of the large service provider in Victoria.
The e-mail revealed every child's place of residence.
The list shows that a 13-year-old boy has been released against bail, and in his case sexual behaviour is manifested that a 15-year-old girl with problems with self-injury, abuse and expelling of certain substances is "boy-friend outside" and "no return tonight" and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with "self-care" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night exchange supervisor.
The document contains notes on the time when one of the children is expected to come home or whether they can contact the staff for reconciliation.
Many details have been reported worryingly for some children.
As regards the 15-year-old boy, caution has been written: "If staff contacts you to obtain permission to search the room and/or to review the laptop/USB device due to a doubt of inappropriate sexual material, this authorisation must be granted."
The document also states that a 17-year-old girl who receives only three months after 18 and is released from the care agency is at the risk of attempting suicide that staff must call the emergency line immediately in case of his escape.
For a 16-year-old parole-free boy, it was noted that he was outside and "informed with the staff later to get after him."
Although only the name of the accommodation unit where the children are kept and not their addresses are mentioned in the list, the details are sufficient to find them.
The 2015 data leakage came out when the mother and Fairfax Media shared their experiences in communication with the Ministry of Health and Services and with the protection of children four years ago from taking care of her daughter.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
A heartbreaking decision to transfer his daughter to child protection was taken after a violent incident at home. This case is one of the increasing number of family violence complaints parents make against their children.
For example, his daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home, moved hundreds of miles from home to home and to the home where she seemed to succeed, but then moved back without informing her parents, and also accepted and facilitated the relationship between her daughter and her parent husband.
The first relationship with these boyfriends, the 17-year-old, with whom the care authorities allowed a woman to stay at a local hotel regularly during that time of 15-year-old daughters, ended when a few days after the juvenile was submitted to the young man because of his relationship with the child in sexual relations.
"Why did he get out of the system in a worse situation than entering it?" Mother asks.
"And does this happen to all the children under care?"
It strongly supports the establishment of an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children within the first weeks of taking care of them before they are moved to their homes.
This would allow them to understand better how children communicate with others and what risks and needs they face, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need to place children in home care, inter alia, to better support their parents.
Certainly targeted aid packages financed by USD 62 million over four years are designed to help move children from care to better order situations.
In addition, a $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was made public last October, allows professional care providers to offer at least 28 children to help them get out of care or to avoid getting into it.
According to the department's representative, the information file was not formally notified when it happened, although the mother claims that the two department staff were informed within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"All alleged private data leaks are taken very seriously, and we work to ensure that it has no negative effect on young people concerned."
In July last year, Jenny Mikako, the minister of families and children, ordered an independent examination of the sample of private child protection officers during the five-year period.
The Department agreed with the seven recommendations submitted and has subsequently updated the Child Protection Guidelines to ensure that staff understand clearly its roles and privacy activities, have changed IT systems to prohibit automatic unbundling of certain personal data, and have officially reviewed the functions of the department’s privacy.
The commonwealth Bank of Australia is accused of extensive infringements of money laundering
On Thursday, the Australian Government charged the state's largest mortgage to the lender of Commonwealth Bank in widespread violations of the rules against money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Financial Intelligence Agency, AUSTRAC, announced that they have initiated a civil punishment procedure in the Federal Court of CommBank due to the 'fatal and systematic non-conformity' in Australia's largest case of similar nature and in the first case where a large bank is accused.
"CommBank's behaviour in this matter has failed to protect the Australian society against serious and lasting financial crime," said AUSTRAC.
The Commonwealth Bank said in his statement that they would investigate the charges more closely and respond to "when the time is right".
AUSTRAC reported that the largest borrower in Australia did not report "on the right time or at all" any suspicious circumstances, "on the total amount of transactions involving more than 77 million Australian dollars (61 million US dollars).
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing act, in particular with regard to the so-called ‘intelligent deposit machines’.
The previous largest case of this type was previously related to the most popular bets intermediary in Australia, Tabcorp Holdings, who had only 108 alleged infringements.
Tabcorp paid a fine of $45 million in Australia and is the biggest civil punishment in Australia’s corporate history.
The representative of AUSTRAC refused to comment on the possible punishment of CommBank or whether there could be other banks in the fire line of the Agency.
The maximum penalty in case of a transgression of the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is USD 18 million for infringements.
Intelligent deposit machines are a certain type of banking machines that receive both cash and cheque contributions and facilitate anonymous cash contributions.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank's IC machines has increased significantly since they were introduced in May 2012.
The cash contributions amounted to USD 5.8 billion in the six months preceding June 2016 compared to USD 89 million in the first six months after CommBank took up the automates.
AUSTRAC claims in the case-law documents that cash contributions were made under fake names, so that the income was received to the syndicates importing drugs.
"Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspect money laundering or "smurfing" on Commbank's accounts, CommBank did not begin to monitor its customers to make money laundering and terrorist financing difficult and manage," the court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank's accounts were also used to "purchase." This is a money laundering form that includes transfers between countries without actually crossing international borders.
Nordea and DNB will become a reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltian Entities as a financial group bearing the name of Luminor will only occur in the last quarter of this year, the Business Day writes.
Opening doors in the common legal body has been increasingly delayed.
After disclosure of the merger plans in the summer of the soil, banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, the DNB communication manager said that the case would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Inspection gave Luminor additional instructions to fulfil the regional importance of the joint bank.
Trump called it "Narkourka", angering the state's politicians.
"The President is wrong," said the Republican governor of New Hampshire Chris Sununu.
It is disappointing that his misdescription of the epidemic ignores everything that the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, the Democrat of New Hampshire, referred to the comments as "transparent" and said on Twitter that his state is no different from any other that fights against the abuse of widespread opioids.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as the Democrat, agreed.
"It is completely unacceptable that the President speaks about NH in this way," he wrote on Twitter.
This is the entirely wrong image of NH and epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs, including heroin and fentanyl - is the most lethal drug epidemic in the history of America.
According to the data analysed by The New York Times, the overdose killed more people than weapons or car accidents in 2016, an estimated 59 000 people - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, more than 97 million people had recipe for painkillers in the United States, according to the Agency for Disposal and Mental Health.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not appointed by the doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard and its inhabitants have raised the problem several times during the 2016 campaign to the presidential candidates.
New Hampshire was estimated to have been 470 overdose deaths in 2016 compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, these were data from the Ministry of Health and Services of New Hampshire 163.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in the e-mail as "the worst health crisis the state has ever faced."
He said that the government has doubled the resources dedicated to preventive work, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the State has also spent millions of dollars in children's prevention programmes, law enforcement in order to stop drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making naloxone more available for the treatment of overdose.
Call for drivers in connection with the rape of the girl in Witton
The police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the 14-year-old girl's rape investigation.
A teenager was attacked in Birmingham in Witton on 26 July at about 02:00 (BST).
Before that attack, he was raped at the Witton Station.
With regard to the first case, one man has been charged.
The British Transport Police wants to talk to two drivers as part of the investigation.
The police say the first car is a bright sedan.
Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We want to know what was said during this conversation. In addition, the leader may know important details that would help us in the investigation."
The other driver, described as the red VW Sharan, probably took the victim home after the second time he was raped.

Why do dogs suck on the lawn?
Sometimes they think that the dog eats medicine if he doesn't feel well and wants to throw up.
In fact, most of the dogs that eat the medicine are completely healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who chew on the lawn do it due to some disease.
One reason why a dog can suddenly start eating grass may be a nutrient-free table.
Dogs with worms may also be more interested in chewing the grass.
Thus, if a dog who has not chewed the lawn before has suddenly developed by an appetite lawn and often eats it, it is worth checking to a doctor in every case, for example, in order to quickly track possible gastrointestinal problems.
It is worth mentioning that the dog can eat the lawn also because he likes the taste or is simply boring.
If the health problem is excluded, it should be established that the family’s favorite is still sufficiently developing and moody.
Out of the West, squirrel clouds come to Estonia.
In Northern Estonia, many have already heard of noise and seen individual signs.
This afternoon, the weather service also alerted me.
Today, mostly in Northern Estonia, there are several sides of the spark.
Scythes move fast from west to east.
"The outbreaks of the front wind range up to 15 inland islands and coasts in 18 m/s, but the lightning may be accompanied by stronger winds", stands on the weather service website.
However, the larger storm storm in south-eastern Finland and Russia from St Petersburg on the east side.
Fortunately, the winds in Estonia are blowing from the west and the southeast, so there is at least no danger of turning larger storms on Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone is on the guest role in the second season of our life.
On Thursday, the leading producer Dan Fogelman announced in the Television Critics Association press in the framework of the Forum relating to the series that the NBC’s popular drama series will take up Sylvester Stallone in the second season.
As an actor, Kevin (Justin Hartley) plays as a guest in films that take place at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big star," said Fogelman.
At the end of the last season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in the film of Ron Howard, who was briefly strayed through the series.
During this season, we will see how the character participates in the project and also warms up relations with his ex, played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
Fogelman says that Stallone plays "the film Kevin is involved in, the isofiguuri."
"Our life" Milo Ventimiglia, who plays a series of pictures in the past, Hartley's father, played a coincidence in the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa" Stallone's son.
Fogelman said that Ventimiglia's still prosperous friendship with Stallone was probably what helped the show to attract a big star as a guest actress.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I believe it will be really exciting," said Fogelman.
"Our life" will return to television screens on 26 September.
In the United States, two employees of elite universities were arrested after national hunting.
The 42-year-old professor of Northwestern Wyndham Lathem gave himself up to the police himself in California after the police had been looking for him.
The 56-year-old Oxford University employee, Andrew Warren, received the police in San Fransisco.
The man is suspected of brutal stabbing a 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of the month.
A few days later, suspects made a great donation to a library in cash under the name of the dead.
Latham sent a video to friends and family members of a Chicago police officer, which says the biggest mistake of life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police won't publish it.
According to the police, it was a cruel murder and his body had changed because of wounds.
Warren had recently arrived from Britain to Chicago, but researchers have not yet established whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Before the arrest, both suspects escaped the state.
Elise Christie's talking about how he got over Sochi's horror and cybershit to skat again in the name of gold.
Compared to the poor young woman who recently weighed to say goodbye to the swimming adon, the 26 - year - old Christie has changed to the unknown.
The wicked insults swept his legs, especially because he had been frustrated at school in West Lothian when he was a child.
At present, he is packing up his confidence and believes that the trial can come back to the beginning, bringing at least one gold in Pyeongchang.
"No doubt I want to go out as an Olympic winner," he says, fearlessly, to specify the purpose.
"I know I'm both physically and mentally at the right point to do it."
One day he dreamed of a marshmallow until the aesthetic elements began to reduce this interest.
"I was a very skilled jumper, but I had difficulty in seeking the object of art," he said laughing.
"I wasn't very good in elegantity, in regularity.
It was a reasonable choice, because shortfalling is best suited to my personality."
A woman walks around the globe: my daily budget is $5!
By honoring the truth, I have also had this experience, truely for 40 days, where I decided to live the life of the southern France to just be free and live the day at once.
He was stayed in a tent, a forest, a small town station, etc.
The other week, I joined one of the French "home", 44-year-old man was...
Oh, don't think about some faggot tendencies or other: We just stayed in the same park in Mentone and became friends, even though he was 15 years older than me, he was a good companion.
Turns out he's a good family, Paris, former French Navy officer.
It doesn't consume, it doesn't do, it's a good person, it's intelligent, it's a pleasant communicationer, it's a life.
In one word, I joined him and followed three weeks together, from the city to the city and about 5€ daily food money.
The money came, so much to live.
During evenings, the man taught how to offer help in the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants and farms on the road.
We did exactly so much work that it would be for the next 2-3 days, and then...
At some point, I got a fever, and I decided I couldn't...
I took a flight to Helsinki, from home.
And, by the way, I'm still sorry.
I think those 40 days were the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man was burned alive, who stole three musical capabilities from the mosque, mediated by the Hungarian news agency MTI.
The 30-year-old thief sneaked out from the mosque of the city of Bekah near Jakarta on August 1st, but the shriver noticed him and yelling, "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they immediately came after the thief.
That's where the motorcycle escaped and even floated across the river.
Recovery lasted a few kilometres, and then one of the chasing officers hit the back of the rock that was thrown into the head, causing a serious injury.
Assaulted chasing crowd caught the thief and beat him through.
One of the chasing officers chopped over the thief with gasoline and set him on fire.
The innocent died in the burn wounds at the scene.
The body was shipped to the East Jakarta police hospital.
The police took hold of both the dead motorcycle and the stolen sound reinforcements.
At the local press, reports appeared initially, as if it were not a thief, but a electric repairer who wanted to get the sound powered.
But the police twisted these claims decisively.
The owners of the deceased reported not to make a statement about what happened.
According to the Dpa, the German news agency considers this to be the reason why the Indonesians do not particularly trust police or judiciary.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic state in the world.
Of 255 million inhabitants, Muslims are 87.2%.
Australian cuisine: fingerlaughter to school garden.
The modern Australian kitchen has inherited fingernails and canoe meat from the aborigins of the farm.
The British roots have also had a great deal of influence on the table - for example, the Vegems, the dark brown salt beer butter cream, which is sprayed with bread or cream, reminds the British Marmite.
The meat pie, or the meat pie, which is offered by bouquet potatoes and sauce, is also derived from the British.
The BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, are also from the UK, which are baked by Australians on the barbecue, but rather by the British in the oven.
One of the local desserts is the beseetor of Pavlova, although it is also called their inventory by the New Sealanders.
The sweetest is also adorned with coconuts and oat beads with crude Anzac cookies and cococonut-cheese-cooked kex rods of lamington.
Honey Joys, or honey beans, are called honey-maize flakes.

In the autumn of this year, Stephanie celebrates his 77th birthday.
His father was a state official, and his mother Mary loved very much food.
Stephanie studied the library at the university, and as young people in Australia were customary, he also went to discover Europe after studies.
In France, Stephanie’s food love was just invasion and development.
In London, however, he met his first husband, the roots of Jamaica, Monty, with whom they returned to Australia, opened a simple place for the Jamaican House in Melbourne in 1964.
Ten years later the marriage broke down and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976, he already opened a restaurant for a slightly wealthier people at Stephanie's Restaurant, which was one of the most expensive restaurants in Melbourne for the next 21 years.
The restaurant is still mentioned as the first fine dining place in Melbourne, which really could value the fresh raw material and offered seasonal food - the fact that seems to be aabitsy at the end of the century, but it has not yet been.
After the restoration of the restaurant in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cocaine books, they have appeared 15 from his feathers.
Although there are more productive food writers in Estonia, no book has been simply a recipe.
For Australian homecake, the various Stephanie Alexander cook books have been unreplaceable.
For his life, the lady has a fifth cocaine book, a superficial "The Cook's Companion" (The Cook's Companion), which is now at least half a million Australian homes.
The book first appeared in 1996, the supplemented edition in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my book cloth, this 2004 edition takes quite a lot of space, because the imposing book contains about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
But the latest option is even more volatile.

This is a real cocaine bibl where, in addition to prescriptions, different raw materials are purchased and stored, food preparation technologies are presented and recommendations are made for the purchase of kitchen supplies.
Food products are in alphabetical order, and there are also many cross-references in the work - obviously, the library education of the food writer did not run down the side.
Stephanie himself stresses that this book changed his life and gave a new direction to future activities.
As a result of the popularity of the book, he has something to give people, led to the next large kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances are comparable to school gardens.
The fourth Estonian person received a heart in Finland.
The post-operative period has been expected to take place together with the Finnish medics who took part in the surgery in the North Estonia Regional Hospital (PERH).
"It's hard to say how long the patient could have been able to live without a new heart," said Põder.
According to doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for up to eight years.
The man himself will recover and will not be ready to discuss this matter.
He was diagnosed for the first two years ago, and the disease had reached the final stage, and heart failure was caused by ischemic disease.
"For this sick, transplantation was the only option," added Taal.
According to Cardiocurgical Surgery, the patient no longer has any battery or lead along the heart pump after transplantation.
He only has a scar and immunity depressing grass.
The patient can do sports and generally live on like a normal person," he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
The drum added that it would take three to six months to complete recovery.
According to both doctors, the patient should be closely monitored for the treatment of medicinal products, while there are side effects.
In addition, the patient should be inspected in order to avoid a donor organ rejection.
The most dangerous is the first year, but ISHLT, according to International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50% of patients live over ten years.
In Helsinki, it stated that the results have been better, and for the longest time, they have lived with the heart transplanted for 25 years.
The cardiocircumference explained that because of the disease, the patient’s blood circulation was poor, a heart pump was put on him a year ago, which helped to revive the operation.
When his pulmonary artery pressure fell, he became a suitable candidate for transplantation.
The transfer operation is not considered to be a very difficult surgery in the opinion of the Taali: the right timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump, and then to get the heart when you put a new heart in," he said.
In addition, the cardiocyrrhoea led to a complex part of the surgery that was removed from the outer bloodstream.
Rather, he said that heart transplantation may be considered branchal because it is the least needed by Estonians.
Renal, liver and lung transplants are much more done.
Well, the rare cut still has an enthusiasm, but we've been practicing this job for many years.
Self-performing and getting to know your nervous system is one of the arts at the office," added Taal.
The body needs four more people.
The patient’s heart was reported to be hearted because any other patient living in a country of Scandia transplant in the Community was inadequate.
Scandiatransplant is a organisation of organ exchanges with members of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
The list of heart transplantation is now four more people in Estonia.
"They are still read in patients," stressed by Põder.
The longest time, Taal says the heart is expected by large men with a 0-positive blood group.
"In Finland there's a queue for about six months," he said.
There is a share of conditions to get a heart.
"The heart of a woman is generally not suitable for a man, the heart of a large person is small and so on," listed a cardiocrurg.
How to Financing Business Vehicles?
In the changed consumption community, the financing opportunities for companies have been expanded - in addition to the usual lease, companies are increasingly using full-service lease or, on the other hand, a more non-binding long-term car rental.
The leasing and leasing of vehicles are two clearly different financial transactions, which include different obligations and expectations, but which often cause confusing.
According to the International Car Hire Company AVIS Villi Translation, the Estonian sales and marketing manager shows that companies are increasingly moving towards full service leasing and that more and more and more will be used for long-term rental.
The translation highlighted the main questions to which it is possible to choose an appropriate way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long do you use the vehicle?
The highest difference between car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"It is preferable for a longer-term vehicle if the company has a plan to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period," explained Tõld, adding that it is worth determining if it is intended to have a vehicle, full-time lease or long-term lease, if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, i.e. a daily car, but leaving maintenance obligations for the service provider and n-nothing the property.
"The leasing period is considerably shorter than the leasing period, but many major car rental companies also offer a long-term car rental where car rental is carried out without complex contracts and free-response", Tuld introduced various car rental options.
Who's gonna be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the conventional lease, the renter will be owned by the car.
"In the case of full leasing, it is possible to continue on the same or better terms as leasing, receiving an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company," he said, emphasising that since the consumption community is increasingly moving to service-centric consumption, the vehicle has an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of full-service lease, there is a possibility of buying a car on the basis of wishes and agreed conditions.
However, there is no possibility and is only paid for the period of use.
Car leasing is usually carried out in the car companies' offices and car rental from the rental office of the rental companies.
However, car companies are primarily engaged in the sale of vehicles, but they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
But the rental companies have cars with their sole purpose to rent them out.
The translation said that the reasons for the use of the rental service are different - many companies rent professional vehicles, in addition, the service is convenient to use in command or on vacation or if their own car is in repair.
"Ametic vehicles are increasingly transferred to a full service lease, which provides customer with transparency of costs, timely savings in the purchase, use and recovery process and greater comfort", presented the growing leasing trends of sales and marketing managers.
Every year, more and more companies use full-time lease for their car parks, optimizing their costs and focusing on their main business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
If the car leased is compulsory in case of cash and road insurance, the rental car is mostly covered with basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether, for example, to be included in emergency insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "If, however, the normal lease is compared to full-service lease, the customer will receive more at an equivalent hot level, since, in addition to the vehicle and insurance, heated also covers regular car maintenance, day-to-day aid, tyre change and other agreed services", the Tõld explained.
"If any new vehicle can be taken into the ordinary lease, in the case of full-time lease, the service provider will help to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes account of the functions of use," he compared, highlighting that the full-service lease will certainly help to optimise the costs of the company's car parks.
"But the choice of passenger vehicles depends on the car rental park of the service provider - different rental companies offer both small and economic vehicles in their own vehicle parks for use in urban transport and luxury until now for business meetings", said Tõld.
Of course, during a narrow lease period, the car you want has already been rented, but the booking of the desired vehicle will help you to book early.
By choosing between leasing or leasing, firstly, its objectives should be made clear - for the long term the desire to use the vehicle and the long-term plans for the car.
Certainly, it is also worth a careful look at the different conditions and obligations of the services.
At the last press conference, Mr Olga Ivanova, member of the Confederation of the Edgar Savi saare Election Union, said that the Savisaare electoral union offers the Environment in autumn elections in Tallinn a whole competition.
But how likely is Edgar Savisaar working with Urmas Sõõrumaa Electoral Union "This Tallinn"?
The U.S. Marine Veteran was ordered to remove from the mailbox a envelope of the American flag.
The dispute between the Veteran of the United States of America and the Florida Homeowners Union is at the heart of a postbox covered by the American flag.
Erus U.S. Navy Officer John Ackert says that last week he received a letter from the Alliance of the Tallahassee Southwood residents, asking him to remove or face punishment in a envelope of a state flag on the mailbox.
He told the toilet that he wasn't going to give up without a fight and has made an appeal.
"I'm going to be honest about this as a temptation," said Ackert.
And I think people should fight any form of temptation, especially that.
Ackert said that, according to the Union of owners, his postbox is not in line with Southwood's aesthetic values.
John Ackert, the United States Marine Veteran, said that he was told to remove his mailbox in a envelope covering his American flag.
Because of the approach of the end of the holiday season, we ask you to remove from the mailbox in the envelope of the American flag," sent a letter.
Beauty may be outside 30 days before and shall be withdrawn not later than 15 days.
He said he's been out in the envelope for four years.
It got there 30 days after he moved into the house.
The messages to the Southwood Housing Community were not answered immediately on Thursday morning.
Some neighbors of Ackert told the WCTV that the letter was a little harsh, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Union's owners.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why shouldn't you be patriotical in your country?
Mike Patel said, "It's a veteran who served our country.
It's just a flag mailbox.
I don't think that's right.
The house belongs to him, at least it can be allowed.
The letter of the Householders Union says that Ackert has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he will have a fine.
He hasn't received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam's "repentance" for the German kidnapping.
Vietnam said on Thursday that he regretted the kidnapping of Vietnam's intelligence service, which is a former Vietnamese oil company, who is being sought in the home country because of his acquisitions.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was captured from Berlin, which left 48 hours to leave the country on Wednesday.
Thanh faces prosecution of death in the event of a convict.
He was looking for acyl from Germany, but his application was not yet to be processed when the Vietnam authorities demanded his extradition.
The representative of the Foreign Ministry of Vietnam, Le Thi Thu Hang, told the reporters that these comments were "very regrettable" and Thanh himself gave up on 31 July to the police in Vietnam himself.
"Vietnam always thinks it's important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without falling into details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after the original accusation of unfair management in the State PetroVietnam subsidiaries of PetroVietnam, which brought about USD 150 million losses.
Vietnam's police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, a police investigation was initiated to investigate his alleged participation in the real estate development project.
Thanh was Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed in the government to several senior posts, including the southern Chairman of Hau Giang Province in Mekong Delta.
He was elected in May 2016 to the National Assembly, but was released from the overwhelming legislative body of the Communists prior to the month following its first meeting.
He was also thrown out of the Communist Party.
The Ambassador of Vietnam, Germany, was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, and it was informed that Germany would require Thanh to be returned in order to ensure that the procedures for asyl and extradition can be implemented correctly.
The bus driver saved eight puppies from the side of the road without knowing that dogs actually have a owner.
"Where am I putting these eight puppies, I would have been thrown out of the apartment with a woman with dogs," joked by the bus driver Oleg, who saved the dog puppies who screwed around on the road without surveillance, giving them over to the asylum employee.
Soon, however, the owner of dogs in the asylum, for whom the puppies were taken away from his home, was unreasonable.
The Harjumaa bus driver Oleg said that he's been a bus driver since the early 1990s, but this case has never occurred before in his career."I drove on the bus number 146 to my usual route.
Near the Harju-Rist, I noticed there was something small running around the road.
I thought it was a spoon, but it turns out it was four puppies," remembered the bus driver.
At the moment, the heart went nuts, and he stopped the passengers full of the bus to pick up the puppies.
"The damage began, the cars would've drove over them, and the dogs would've knocked off," said Oleg.
He added that passengers were reasonable and that soft dog children also enjoyed them.
At the beginning, the puppies were a little scared, but then they got fun.
The puppies on board, the bus driver went to a new circle because the schedule needed to be followed.
On the way back to the puppies' inventory, he saw four other little dogs there.
It was a German lamb dog with puppies.
They were so straightforward and immediately saw that they were taken care of.
Dogs were beautiful, amazing.
The first idea was, of course, that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason," said the bus driver that he decided to pick up the puppies on the bus for that reason.
"I also picked up those four puppies and called the police," said Oleg.
The Corrakois contacted the Tallinn animal shelter, the employee of which came to the puppies after the Baltic Station.
But didn't the bus driver have any temptation to take the hairballs?
That's the idea.
One dog boy was so beautiful and calm.
He sat pretty like a grown dog," said Oleg.
But where do I put those eight puppies?
She would have thrown me out of the apartment with dogs.
We still have a little child.
Early to take a dog," he added.
Eve Tobias, the head of Tallinn's animal asylum, confirmed that there were indeed eight dogs of German sheep dogs of two and a half months of age.
But already on the same day, the owner came to pick up the puppy family.
"We didn't even shape these puppies in, and we gave them back," he noted.
"The owner of the dogs wasn't very upset, but he said they had the only house in sight, and the bus driver could have come to see if the puppies belonged to them," said Tobias.
However, the head of asylum added that it is good that the bus driver picked up the bums on the road, and that was why no accident happened.
In fact, it was very good for the bus driver to react!
Jordan's court forced three U.S. military soldiers to kill lifetime sentences
The Jordan Military Appeal Tribunal has sentenced the Jordanian soldier last year for the release of three US military trainers in life.
Last month, Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayha was appointed by the military tribunal at the entrance to the South Jordan airport for killing Americans with a hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened a fire on the American caravan, claiming he was afraid of the base attack.
After the security camera video published the decision showed that he continued shooting even when two Americans were shadowed and dragged with their hands to stop the shooting.
The news site of Hala Akhbar, related to the Jordanian army, announced on Thursday that the military appeal court, with five judges, confirmed the sentence of Al-Tuwayha.
James Harrison spends about $300 000 a year to keep his body in the game form.
Every NFL player depends on his body to earn his living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest a lot of money in the maintenance and restoration of the body in order to remain in the top form.
Jeremy Fowler from the ESPN.com portal examined further how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their careers.
However, none of the cases is as extreme as the 39-year-old James Harrison, the player of the back line of Pittsburgh Steelers for the 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends $300 in the middle of a year on needle therapy, massage therapy, kiropractices and pumps.
Most of the costs are related to travel across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to count on such things," said Harrison.
"If compared the sums earned with my expenses, payments are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at Steelers, estimated the annual amount of care for his body for $200.
30-year-old Mitchell has tested the relaxation of the body (in English "body tempering"), described by Fowler as "55 kilos of metal used as a massage roll".
"Besides rolling on it, it's rolling on you," said Mitchell.
"If you have a tense place in your leg and they're going to move this thing around, it's sometimes painful.
But when you get up, the tension's almost gone.
It just kicks out the tension."
They're ready to make extra effort, but the former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 per year to recover.
Cofield, who played for 10 seasons in New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he didn't spend more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more," said Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably say at least twice more.
I was in the first eight years of my career with very good health.
To the end, maybe it would have helped with more procedures."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old guard line player, expressed his readiness to follow his veterans with Steelers teammates.
"If you pay 100 000 dollars and earn more than three million, this decision is quite simple," said Shazier.
As regards the long-term career, investing players in recovery is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play longer than 30 years of life, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to direct his costs to another.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Festival Baltic's boss Gunnar Viese tells the Evening Page that the festival was received from Finland in early years, and its owners went to enlarge by looking at the beach strip on the Riga side, but Pärnus stopped on the way back, and so was the festival sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have targeted 25,000 visitors a day, but the chicks will only be counted when they pass the festival.
Preparation for this year's party started in September.
"We had information from the city that the last place starts building, there comes a hotel," tells Gunnar, what a change was to face this year.
Now, there's no clue in there, but I guess if the clue didn't go down this year, it'll be next.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime," he explains why the festival has moved this year.
They're having a festival schedule over a year.
People work between a thousand and a half thousand in the Week, police officers, management teams, volunteers, traders, security teams, and so on.
The hardest thing Viese said was to perform the Weeken to get a duot The Chainsmokers.
The men are now an unquestionable premier of the pop music world.
Why the Chainsmokers was difficult to get to the Week was and how Gunnar commented that two artists canceled their performances, see the video.
In answer to Ansip, we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
Vice-President of the European Commission, Andrus Ansip, in the interview with Chronics, told him that he was sad to look at Estonia's everyday policy because the Government of Jüri Rathas has turned on the head of the simple and predictable tax system.
In the magazine Chronics, you used the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia’s success and what I can be proud of.
I am delighted that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team and with the months that have been read, many of which have been expected in Estonia for over ten years," wrote Ratas today in social media.
According to the Charter, these are decisions, for example, to increase income tax reforms for people, to ensure the ageing pension reform, to balance the development of Estonia, to increase agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and, of course, to provide health reforms available and high quality medical assistance.
"I wish you a good holiday!" wrote the wheel in turning to Ansip.
Winters in Pärnu Week: a drunken man climbed into an alien car
Last night, at three o'clock, the police got a bit of a challenge.
In fact, one of Audi's owners announced that in the tank near Port Artur, some stranger man climbed into his car and fell asleep.
A patrol responding to the event found a man who was frightened when the regularists arrived.
In particular, the man was tired of his journey for a moment and found a place in the back seat of a stranger's car.
"The man began to return to his way of home after the regular guards' wake," says the West Prefecture in Facebook.

The stupidest questions to ask the bartender.
Huffington Post is interchanging the bartenders' ears with questions that they prefer not to hear.
What drink do you best do?
Indeed, there are more ingredients in some drinks than the other, but the same skills and flexibilities are needed to produce them.
Bar servicers often interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fast to prepare now?", which signals to them that the client has anything he drinks, make it difficult for a bartender or not.
What kind of drink do you like to do the most?
This issue is interpreted in the same way as what cocktail would be the easiest thing to get from the bar right now.
It's not about the bar servicer to say, it's the client who makes his own decisions according to the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, the bartenders would ask if there are some special offers at this point.
What's good for you?
Perhaps behind this question is a soft desire to know if the bar is different from any other offer, but it could be asked differently.
Also, the bar can't imagine what the client would prefer.
Can I have a drink that isn't very sweet?
Here, in the same way as the previous rule, the bar is not familiar with your taste and preferences, and for one, it may not be sweet for others.
But he's ready to listen to what flavors he recommends could contain.
Does that drink cause me headache/pomell?
The bartender is not a medic or a predictor to allow it to the client, with his heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad so much that package trips are not only expensive but sold out, regardless of price.
Even cheap flight tickets and last-minute tickets should not be expected, it is wise to think more about the next year's travel plans.
The man hostaged the model with a plan to sell him in the darkwater.
The Polish citizen took hostage in Italy to the UK model.
The man had a 20-year-old woman scheduled to auction in a dark web, which is a encrypted internet, announced Guardian.
According to the police, the woman was attracted to Milan by July 11 with a promise that she would get a job at the photo session.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
Supposedly, the prisoners tried to sell a woman in the darkwater for 230 000 pounds and submitted a ransom claim to his model agency.
However, on 17 July, the woman in jail took her to the British Consulate.
The police confirm that the suspect Polish citizen, Lukasz Herba, lives in Britain.
According to Corriere della Sera, a man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a little child and didn't want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such experiments attract people.
It would be very good if we were to stop thinking and draw conclusions.
It is obvious that the recommendation for a friend to study the background of those who wish to be friends to spend a little more time.
In general, however, everyone could have a strategy that he shares on himself in social media.
At national level, however, it is necessary to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats posed in social media.
The lifetime of the werewolves created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but certainly not by the real devils.
You still have to go to the woods for whatever reason.
But if it's cool between the skin, it's time to make a hot tea drink.
There are enough resources in the forest to do that.
Defense Home! It's a little overview.
We are talking about tea because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which is to some extent stimulating, but is not best for our health.
The use of herbs in free nature must always be prepared for testing because both the prescriptions and the flavors are different.
Some plants don't need a boiling long, it's just enough for hot water to float; others, however, must be left for hours.
Of course, you must also be careful to ensure that water and plants are clean enough.
A great deal also depends on the season and place of collection.
Let us now take a closer look at how to make some simple tea drinks and what impact they may have on us.
Pine octopus
Pine occults can drink quietly around the year.
If it's good to drink 2 litres of water a day, then it's good to do it well to also satisfy the need for vitamin C and add some additional energy.
As with all plants, it is possible to obtain useful elements from pineapples using alternative methods, for example by crushing - the oaks do not need to cook long, enough to get hot water up and not pull for a few hours.
For half a litre of water, 0,4 litres of occals need to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a beverage of approximately 25 mg vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, i.e. about 20 kcal sugar.
Citrus and honey can always be added to the flavor of pineapples.
And when the drink became ugly, it can be diluted with water like syrup.
Cooking of hexadecakes works the same way, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
Raspberry beverage is great and helps with a lot of problems, from rheumatoid to rheumatoid artery.
The barrel helps to overcome fatigue, has a pain-resistant effect and helps in the event of cold-freezing diseases as a relief of cough and as a lowering of fever.
Consequently, it would not be worth drinking more than half a litre a day.
The barber drink also sweats, so in winter it should be found a more calm moment to enjoy it.
To make a drink in winter, take fresh raspberries, during summertime use leaves, vegetables or berries.
For half a litre of drink, a small boiling boiling boiling oxygen is needed, which should be boiled until the water acquires a red tone.
You can also make a image of the barber shops.
To that end, crush the sleeves and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Longer and more thorough treatment will also make the drink stronger.
The finished can be added to pine occults as a flavour.
Blackberries
The black nut is a hip spoon that looks like a black-burned piece on the tree.
It is mostly found in sauce, but also elsewhere.
The fungi is very widely used as a hot drink, a light, instead of a fig, etc.
A thousand can be well washed, too.
Black nuts are a kind of super drink that can be used to treat a lot of diseases, even cancer, to increase tone, to reduce stress, to prolong lifetime.
Seed contains a number of unique compounds and a lot of vitamin B as well as antioxidants and a little minerals and proteins.
Tea made from seed may drink every day, there is no risk of overdose.
It is sufficient to make a drink about 3 x 3 cm piece of fungal, which is to be boiled in 2-3 litres of water for 5 to 15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth largest island of Vorms in the context of the small island cruise, where he met local authorities and residents to discuss the topical topics of island life.
The round trip to the island of Vorms began from the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Rata was greeting Tanel Viks of Vorms and Ivo Sarapuu, President of the municipal council.
The first visit was the historic Church of St. Olavi and the surrounding cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its ring and sandstone crosses.
A visit to Vorms Children's Gardens-Priority School was followed, where Director Age Hälvin spoke to the Prime Minister about the living conditions of the school and the teaching arrangements that are part of the school's students in disciplinary education.
Before the afternoon, the Prime Minister had a new and modern joint operational service building opened in 2015, which also had a meeting with the island people.
The debate addressed important issues for the population, such as the development of shipping and airlines between small islands and the continent.
The country has undertaken to ensure a regular transport connection in small islands with permanent housing, but for example, traffic increasing during the summer period makes the important journeys of local residents more difficult.
These are the places where the State will be able to take into account local wishes and needs in the early and planning process," said the Prime Minister.
In addition, issues relating to the construction of ports of small ships, education of interest, the safety of the island and the rescuing capacity were discussed.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of the prime minister's small island round trip, to explore the environment of the islands and to discuss the issues that are expected to be resolved by local residents and government leaders.
In July, he has visited the islands of Ratas Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsand, and Manilaidu, during August, Naissaart, Prague and Aegna.
For the first time, the Environment will take elections without a political founder and an ideological cornerstone.
So far, we said the Center and we thought about Savisaar or otherwise.
Now, the Center needs to find a way without him.
In this respect, they also need to be lamented between the colorful of the party, the expectations of the criminal and embarrassing past, the Savi Island party supporters and the electorate.
The leaving of the Savior will put the Central Era the most complex situation in the ideological plan.
Based on the current policy practice and ideology, the old rhino can be sure to play over them.
A number of cards that used to work as drummers may not be realised this time.
The Population Card for the Centre is not working because Savisaar can always be allowed more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian map is difficult due to the state of the Central Region as well as because we also see here the so-called Savinova Electoral Alliance pushing the bottom of the gas.
The Patient Card is already in the pocket of Savi Island due to the ongoing trial.
For the centre district, there's also lost a map of the People's Front and the poor insults.
The first of these is that the coalition partners in the government are impeding its undeveloped and the second more powerful play.
However, one card may be of even greater weight.
All the last elections have confirmed that the political parties that can formulate and implement the main conflict of elections are successful.
The main conflict has always been twisted around Savi Island.
If some political parties have the idea of blowing into a well-functioning confrontation, there is another trumpet missing from the Middle East card package.
So what's left for the Center?
The strong party gear and the considerable resources they have left.
The tape cuts will also be sufficient before the elections.
Most of the taxpayer’s self-reklamings made with money from four years ago are now hopefully repaid to the tallinians.
Tallinn city media is still in place, but there has been fewer cultivation of political geriljaajakirjas.
In addition, the political party has audio magnets.
Their role will be to bring out the came of the Canastans this time, because the image of the EPP is not sufficient to motivate the electorate considerably.
In the ideal plan, the Jüri Ratas must find its way because the journey ended with savisaarlus this week.
In Australia's waters, 3 US Marines disappeared in an accident.
The U.S. Navy and the Navy stopped searching, reported Camp Butler at the Navy Station in Japan, in principle confirming that the military will no longer hope to find the missing people alive.
An accident happened with a Marine Aeroplane Osprey MV-22, which took off USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom were able to find and save.
The crashed plane took part last month in the joint exercises of the United States and Australia in the Queensland State in Shoalwater Bay.
Australian Minister of Defence Marise Payne said that the Saturday incident took place near the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
The woman found an alien wedding ring in the washing machine. Who could this belong to?
"I began to get the laundry out of the machine when the light washing machine washes in my eye between the rubber tile," says the woman how she found an alien wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay attention to the light at the door of the washing machine at the first pace.
I put the machine on again.
"On the side of two little children, this dirty laundry is going to happen right now," she's a woman.
When I had a second washing and I started to take out the laundry, the light washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washer washing off my eye and I found this ring there.
A golden wedding ring has been marked by the name of a married man named Tom 14 years ago.
Because in a family, someone named a man or a woman who could be married to some Tom, I don't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin examined the parent's child that he may have found a ring in his yard, put it in his pocket, and the ring has been entered through that washing machine, but the child confirmed that he hadn't brought the ring home.
Karin has lived in the apartment of Madala Street in Tallinn with his companion.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine comes from that time.
But if the ring was supposed to have anything to do with the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm demanded, and I can't understand the way the ring landed in the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the lifetime is fast enough for two little children, you forgot to find a home closet at first.
"On the last time there have been posts searching for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was the last time to look for the owner of his own ring", Karin refers to a case circulating in social media where the wedding ring found in Tallinn on the Puhangu street has been found happily by the owner of the last week.
"While the Facebook finds and searches for different things, then I thought first there to try luck," says Karin, whose post has already been divided by nearly 4,000 people.
"Post has received any feedback and not all are not good," she is thrilled, referring to the first comments she was recommended to take her husband to the lizard.
Then it felt like we needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the greatest cheater he's ever heard of.
Honestly, it made me worry at first, but later on, when the comments came, that maybe I myself had a ring with the owner, it already made me laugh.
The commentators also suggested that the ring may have reached the woman in the pocket of clothes in the second round.
"Well, last time somewhere six months ago, some other rounds of pants were bought for work that flew into a washing machine without further investigation, but does she really?" she talk about herself.
All right, but we agreed with our life mate that now, for principle, we have to find the ring's owner.
Whatever the reason that this ring disappears.
Divorce, family line or whatever.
I think it's the only right thing to do, because if I ever lose a wedding ring, I know that I would be grateful to a person who would try to find me and return valuable assets.
Karin has also referred to the family status office to obtain assistance from it in finding the owner.
However, I received an answer that in Estonia at this date and the name of the Lord has not been married.
One ring has found the owner.
Recently, the married ring found in Pelguranna, Pelguranna, found in Tallinn, reached the owner’s hand happily on 21 July, and the graveling promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I spent the morning with dogs, and I noticed the rest behind 53 houses, inside the intruded track, a gold ring," Gerli says that the graveling allowed to assume that it belongs to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (picture) on his Facebook page and in the group "Marked in Tallinn", sharing information with the city and the Nordic prefecture.
In two weeks, the police contacted Gerli and announced that the ring carrier was identified.
"I got contact with the daughter of the owner, and on Monday night, she went into the possession of her daughter." The ring was lost because the old lady had injured her hand and put her finger on the other finger where it had slipped off.
"He lost it the same day in the morning I walked with my dog," says Gerli.
Although the media has been focused mainly on Pärnu and the Weeken there, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
There are loyal fans at the Intsikurmu festival in Põlvamaa.
One of them writes on Twitter, for example, "I sold the Week ticket so I could go to Incikurmu."
And why not.
In addition to domestic artists, there are performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere.
The festival in the magical forest is also surprising the artists present there because of the charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn't see how beautiful Estonia is this morning on Twitter.
But the visitors have not had goats in sharing the cool things.
To participate in Incikurmu's festival magic, see also the galleries!
In the Estonian U18 group, the half-final recognised the best of Britain and the A division could not be accessed
The first quarter of which the British won with five points (18:23), many baskets were thrown.
During the second quarter, the difference increased further and rested in the nine-point progress of guests (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third column, but with only one point.
The Estonians’ loss was eight points before the last ten minutes (46:54).
During the fourth quarter, the Estonian game was completely broken and, ultimately, the loss had to be accepted by numbers 61:75.
The loss broke the Estonian hopes of reaching the A division, because there are only two of the best conveniences.
In the third place game tomorrow, Estonia will respond with the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.
Police are searching for Estonia's mail card
Europol is hunting the Tallinn Night Club stabster.
The Russian citizen Ernest Gammer, who stabbed a stranger in the Night Club in Tallinn in 2010 and caused serious health damage, has received a list of the most wanted people in Europe.
The Australian Leagues stand on the crossroads
Professional sport stands on the crossroads in Australia: some areas have travelled on a corporate road so far that they are too business-oriented to classify sports;
others return to the world of amateurs, which is too sporty to consider it business.
This confusion is demonstrated by Cricket Australia (CA)’s painful delays in reaching a pay agreement with players, the Australian Rabbi Union (ARU) indefinitely deployment of the team, the uprising of the Australian Football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the difficulties with ragbile in the assembly of the independent Commission to function and the unacceptable attempts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be a flag of social justice among the people.
The investor banker and Chairman of the Australian Sports Committee John Wylie have attempted to actively guide the Olympicsport on the same path as professional leagues, putting leading positions on businessmen with no basic experience in sports.
The digging of Rio Tinto, which has a reputation for the use of the trade unions' tactics, was seen in the problems of collina CA in reaching an agreement with the Australian Cricket Players Union (ACA).
David Peever, Chairman of the CA, is the former Managing Director of Rio Tinto Australia, and he hired the CA to assist the Rio Tinto leader and advisor for his salary negotiations.
But it would be wrong to think that the elite men whose approach is unfaithful in dealing with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever, for example, was a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
However, strict negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have made the impression that Australia’s summer favourite route now belongs to more business than sport.
On the contrary, ARU's incompetent leader, NAB's former CEO Cameron Clyne's inability to pick up the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed too back to this root.
The people of the Ragbile Union now prefer to stadium downtown to watch the game between the amateur teams, at the same time robbing a beer and making a hot dog.
The Ragbite congratulates that they have the most corporately qualified and versatile management in Australia, but too many failures to meet the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much of sport to be business.
Both the Ragbilique and the football have problems with leadership, as stakeholders demand more power.
Both too Presidents, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been sufficient to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Cangaroo, led a successful IT company, but was completely away from the game for 20 years.
This became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
Too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one who has participated in the last three years in ragbique in any way, except as a passive fan, could be involved in the Commission's work.
Pendel, however, moved too far to the business side, and too many fans have been looking for a savior since then, someone who has a prominent history in sports.
Managing Director of the Westfield Foreign Investments Lowy's real FFA Chairman from his father Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
The A-Liiga clubs want to be better represented in the Board of Governors Congress.
Their owners lose money, but they believe they're as dignified as Manchester United.
Ironically, the Chancellor of Sports and Business Ethics sends FIFA ambassadors to end the sports civil war.
AFL has its own links with Rio Tinto recently retired President Mike Fitzpatricku and former Commissioner Chris Lynchi of AFL, through the finance manager of the mining donor.
Too proud of the role of the national leader in promoting gender equality, domestic and refugees' activities and gay rights.
Some candles could suggest that it is done by hiding government funds.
Richard Goyder, the AFL president, said Fitzpatricku, "the AFL is more than business, given how it helps all these communities."
Goyder is soon the Executive Director of Wesfarmers and the First Chairman of AFL, who has not played the game at the elite level.
Former President of Wesfarmers, Bob Every, is an active chairman of Cricket Australia.
It is often a priority for the appointment of the members of the Board of Directors of Professional Sports to be a priority of independence to competency.
In the ash of recruitment, they have forgotten something that could be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not used to the critical monitoring activities of media intensive and sometimes personal levels.
Something that works in a corporate world may not be transferred to the sports sector.
Flynn submitted a report on the disclosure of the corrected information indicating additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served shortly as President Trumpi's National Security Advisor, presented a report on the publication of improved federal financial information on Thursday, containing new details of Flynn's contracts regarding the transfer of Trump to the Presidential Office, the Iranian businessman and the information disregard of the company's mother company working for Trumpi's campaign.
In a letter that sent information with the corrections, Flynn noted that its initial disclosure reports were submitted in urgent circumstances without the usual consultation and review of the White House’s lawyers and the Government’s ethics agency.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive any attention given to others because he was no longer a worker of the White House at that time.
Flynn gave up his post only 24 days after his appointment in the middle of the hearing that he had provided Vice-President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties to the Russian ambassador in the United States.
Flynn also received criticism for external payments made to him during the private sector work after the resignation of the Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
Flynn announced in the previous information published to the investigators of the Chamber that in 2015 the entities related to Russia received fees and payments of approximately $68 000.
In addition to the income related to Russia, the information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least USD 5000 for consultancy services in the case of a project for the construction of nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was already publicised before, but it was not known that it was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at that time with the Cambridge Analytica British mother - or the Donald Trump campaign hired a data record company.
Cambridge's one of the main donors is the risk fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential conservative financial supporter.
Washington Post announced in February that Flynn was hired as a SCL Group advisor.
According to his role, Flynn was intended to help the American subsidiary of SCL to win new public contracts with the United States.
At the same time, SCL hired a former colleague of Flynn from the National Intelligence Director of the Office as a driver for the pursuit of the award of public contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation or actual work from the SCL, as claimed by the person who was informed of his activities.
With the new information, Flynn received about $28,000 in connection with the transfer of Trump to the presidential office.
The largest available source of income is 140 000 dollars for Flynn's work as a consultant and consultant of NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis. This company is run by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press announced on Thursday night the NJK's statement that "advocates Flynn NJK Holdings with regard to the interest of investment in the securities of the company".
NJK finances a technology company called GreenZone Systems with Flynn's vice-chairman.
GreenZone is headed by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner in Flynn Intel, a company currently investigating as a result of its role in lobbying on behalf of a company in the Netherlands related to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the Head Democrat in the Committee on Monitoring and Government Reform, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
In Flynn's previous security check, Kian told military investigators that he had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, Flynn didn't tell the same detective anything about such contacts.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Flynn was still conducting security checks at that time.
The main speaker was lived on stage in Augustibluul, the singer was taken to Tallinn with ambulance.
Ivan reached the end of the set when he was injured.
Indrek Ditmann tells life24.
"The plan was delayed, but the festival goes on," he says and adds: "The public has been informed, of course, they also saw everything on the stage."
At the moment, Ivan is on the way to Tallinn with an ambulance, and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope the best," says Ditmann to the end.
The headmaster told Western life that the damage to health occurred during Denisenko’s occurrence.
First, the man stopped singing, then he started to pass the play, and the man fell on the back of the stage.
The stage came to the conference by Jan New Field, who asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / Augustibluus
Ivan Denisenko or Ivan Blues is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural artist.
Ivan's musicians started in parallel with art studies in the Ukrainian National Academy of Arts and Architecturals.
The University was immediately fascinated by his incredibly deep bass and was invited to sing a nationwide known folk-choir Golden Gate.
He was friends with the people who introduced him to the bluffs and later became his bandmates.
The first concert of a band named Ivan Blues & Friends took place in the Rag-Time Bar of Kiev on 31 December 2007.
From there, the band has acted regularly, presenting in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes the book in the backlog
"A Helping Hand" is the first book of Michaels, the former editor of BBC and the mother of two children.
It took three years to finish the book, and it is dedicated to his Phillipian assistants Maricon Espiritule and Ginalyn Narag, who helps to cook food and to keep a son, a four-year-old Joseph, and a daughter, a eight-year-old Florence.
Assistants described as "family members" helped test the recipes while writing the book. This is the first book in Singapore, which is published in both English and backlog languages.
The "A Helping Hand" is available in bookstores everywhere in Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in migrant centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought his colleague had received abdominal virus.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminofene to reduce his fever.
During the rest of the day, he was kept interviewed, punctured, sorted and studied.
No tests showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood why.
For the last two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjögren’s syndrome.
The medicine reduces the ability of the immune system to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissues, as if it were an intruder organism that sows from this case of chaos in both the glands that produce tears and saliva as well as some joints.
Every week's etanercept injections had been helpful by reducing his joint pain.
But he knew that because of this medicine, he was quite helpless in the event of a severe infection.
When the acetaminophen began to work, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the trauma scene decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, as doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and he'll be released home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he took the course of infections to which people who gave etanercept are susceptible.
That list was long.
The viruses cannot be treated until diagnosed, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One bacteria that attacks people with immune insufficiency is a listing bacteria with food.
It is often found in pasteurised milk and cheeses, causing terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that he did not experience.
Leegion business disease is another infection that is common among the users of this medicine but has no cough or shortness of air.
Even more common bacteria Staphylococcus aureus may cause joint infections, but, again, he had no joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to start extensive antibiotic therapy that would cover all these risks.
When meeting the patient, however, it did not seem that he could be inflicted in the hands of a serious infection.
The doctors at the trauma scene had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay the administration of antibiotics and simply monitor and wait for, but if the patient had had one of the infections he had read about, even a few hours of postponeation could have ended with death.
The fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin was even more complicated, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
It created a risk and a benefit for the relationship.
Usually a low contribution decision, whether to start antibiotic therapy or not, will change if its consequences are so dangerous.
He asked my colleague, the other resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell my colleague that he was planning antibiotic therapy, he just asked me to review the patient and give his advice.
The colleague met the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he would be practically defenseless in the event of an infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has experienced penicillin allergy, Girard should be allowed to test him to check if he is tolerant of a medicine that is not a penicillin, but a relative close to it.
Girard asked for a test dose.
If she had had a serious reaction to the medicine, she would have had a rash or had a lower blood pressure.
No one ever happened.
Therefore, he was given a complete dose.
A few hours later, Girard received a call.
The patient’s body temperature had increased to 39 degrees.
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face shined from thin sweat and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked to give another dose of Tylenol, and when he came to the patient for the last time, he fell too deep.
The fever was relapsed.
The sweaty rubber and the pink cheeks were lost.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for the night, he first visited this patient.
He had also received five other patients, but for this patient, Girard was worried at home the most after his daily team was transferred.
During the hours he didn't see him, his blood body had grown in the lab.
It was too early to tell me exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that this is a bacteria that is strong enough to allow Petri to grow quickly and that it is not a Staphylococcus aureus or a legion disease.
The list of other options was long, and none of them actually saw fit.
It took two more days to finally identify the bacteria.
It was a listing bacteria.
Girard, as did all the others who took care of the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, there are pictures of your head's diseases.
For Girard, listerosis was a disease derived from unpasterated milk and soft cheeses, causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked on this unusual infection even further through material and found that although people with normal immune systems may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient colleague.
In pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and injured immune system, the infection can be released outside the gastrointestinal tractor, sometimes without the usual symptoms, and into the bloodstream.
It could spread across the body like a fire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, may end in patients with this type of infection in up to 30% of the fatalities.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, listerosis can be as lethal.
Early antibiotic treatment can save life.
If it's a food-transmitting disease, what kind of food did you wear that bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasterated milk or soft cheese on the trip, the Internet search identified this summer in Scotland a list of assaults related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate a little smoked salmon.
The one where they picked up the bacteria was a secret.
When the doctor team had found out what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised him to take it easy until the end of the summer, but by now he feels pretty well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised to preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When Cronost’s malware was first advertised in Russian underground forums in 2014, the $7,000 price questioned for it suggested that the sale of malware is a profitable business.
The Cronost was advertised as a hacker tool that can obtain data, including usernames and passwords, the PIN codes of cash machines and personal information that is useful in breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins were held at Las Vegas Airport after a week of security conferences at Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community responded to the arrest of its estimated star with breast-feeding and skepticism.
Some have warned that the requirements for Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers - researchers looking for software weak spots to identify and solve problems, not crimes or chaos sowing - and law enforcement bodies.
Others were hesitant to believe that Hutchins could have created such software for attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter, and no one has a model of Kronos, which is apparently odd when he was the author of malware.
Although the exact details of Hutchins Kronos' malware linking are not clear, security researchers often ignored legal problems in search of vulnerable locations from the computer code.
In recent years, major engineering companies have put out "deficiencies' money" to formalise the process of informing researchers of problems and compensating their work.
At the Defcon Conference, in the absence of restrictions on security experts from all over the world, there has also been a tense relationship with law enforcement bodies.
In 2002, for example, the FBI arrested a Russian crypt expert in Las Vegas hotel room after publishing software that might have undermined the security of certain types of e-books.
The Digital Rights Organisation Electronic Frontier Foundation said in his statement that he was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and will examine it further.
WannaCry's lunatics disarmed computers working on Microsoft Windows's older versions.
After spreading, encrypted software computers and locked users' files, folders and disks.
When the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The robbers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the address of the bitcoin.
Hutchins became a random hero.
At the interview to The Guardian in May, Hutchins said that he registered a web domain after discovering that a malignant software was trying to connect with it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he triggered the so-called kill switch, which stopped the spread of the software.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a researcher in Kryptos Logic, a cybersecurity company in Los Angeles, said in an interview that he did not go to college and has learned to write his own software.
The company did not comment.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through the MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and received a special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry.
Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, the owner of New York Jets as ambassador in Britain.
Johnson was the biggest financial supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign and was appointed in November as the financial leader of his inauguration committee.
The long-term Republic donor Johnson also helped collect money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He was formerly the financial leader of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson's grandfather set the foundation for a company producing medical supplies in Johnson & Johnson.
Previously, Matthew Barzun was an ambassador to the United States of America.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned from his position in January of that year before trump was appointed.
The Belgian officials already knew about the contamination of eggs in June
"We already knew about possible problems with insect poison fipronil at the beginning of June," said Katrien Stragier, the mediator of the Belgian Food Safety Agency, in the opinion of the VRT TV channel.
We immediately started the investigation and also talked to the prosecutor because it might have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have questions about health and we are trying to answer them," added Stagier.
The news agency AFP has attempted to obtain information from the prosecutor in the past few days, but he has not said anything because the investigator refused to publish the information.
Chicken eggs have been withdrawn from the sale as a precautionary measure in Belgium until the results of the analyses are found.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from sales in the Netherlands and Germany.
German Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called upon the Dutch and Belgian officials to make an urgent distinction.
"Everybody has obviously polluted eggs with an offenced product," said Schmidt to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Agency (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to exist in Estonia.
"We have no Dutch eggs in Estonia", said VTA Press Officer Martin Altraja BNS.
He also added that there are no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia.
According to the Statistics Office, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands over the last 10 years.
The last time the eggs were imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil reached the channels due to the attempt of the Dutch Chickfriend to cure the affected chickens.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the pesticide-containing substance reached Chickfriendi through the Belgian company are still unauthorised.
Fipronil is moderately dangerous in larger quantities and may have a negative effect on humans, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid gland.
Is there a solution to avoid annoying robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
The Sports City Pizza Pub, located in Buffalo, New York, depends on the customer calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato feathers.
However, a large part of the time is automatic messages that are trying to push the fraud.
"It's about to get to the point that it doesn't allow other callers to get us," said a 24-year-old bar owner.
Help's on the way, even slowly.
Over the last year, the government's incentive to mobile phones has been accompanied by new tools to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to allow telephone companies to block more trash calls and hope to deceive fraud with large fines.
According to experts, these steps are not a final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and stateless non-speaking lists should protect people from unwanted calls from remote distributors.
However, fraudulents do not care if they violate the law.
Traitors reach people cheaply and easily using "automatic electors" that automatically make a lot of calls at the same time.
The Americans are estimated to have tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are fraudulent.
Pharmaceuticals, for example, send automated messages about the recipes.
But too often, the situation is as follows: you owe money to the tax administration; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; it is offered for free cruise!
In addition, smugglers use a complex technology that shows a local or important number on the phone as a caller, such as the tax administration.
The implementation of appropriate measures in the case of numbers intended for "insurance" would make fraud more difficult and would help consumers in the United States to keep millions of dollars together, as stated by the FCC Group of State Prosecutors.
Phone companies and independent applications can screen or block unwanted calls, compared to the databases of known problem numbers and analysing suspicious behaviour, such as the number calling many people in non-speaking lists.
Leaderless service providers also have tools that include incoming calls warnings such as "Reasonably fraud", but they are not available to customers on all phones or for many paid-paid cards.
From Verizon and Sprint, they can be ordered for an extra fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, screening junk calls for free.
The multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando Florida said that his AT&T application labels and blocks certain fraud calls on his mobile phone, but he has abandoned the phone lines.
"I rarely receive calls from numbers that I don't know," Vargas said.
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer home phones free of charge, but with restrictions.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional calls to be directed", which will lead the calls forward if they do not respond or are busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone service providers and is not working on older copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy widgets, some of them are rather grassy, which blocks phone calls.
Verizon also tests to display warnings on suspicious calls on home phone numbers.
Phone companies can already block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules for formalising such practice and allowing the blocking of other suspected calls in fraud.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that accepts calls for the fee, but never initiates any of them.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know they are not legal, e.g. 911 direction numbers.
These rules still need finishing.
Maureen Mahoney, a public-governant in a non-profit consumer Union, said that these developments are "realistic" but do not protect consumers from all unwanted speeches.
Firstly, non-speaking lists do not apply to certain types of calls, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, the FCC rules would cover only fake numbers.
Not all robot calls are designed to cheat.
The Consumers Union wishes that telephone companies make calls blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the longer term, the FCC industry will support its efforts to confirm that the caller is really who he claims to be.
Perhaps one day you can see a green bird on the smartphone screen when the caller is legal.
The U.S. Telecom from the lobby of telephone companies says that it may take several years to introduce it, but it would be a powerful tool against robot speakers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop following annoying calls for consumers who exchange the number.
If you register yourself now in a non-speak-list, but get yourself a new number later, the distributor may not know it and may be disturbing on the new line.
"Robot speakers don't disappear," said Aaron Foss from Nomorobos, a service for blocking calls for mobile and home phones.
"They're criminals and find a new way to pass through any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult for them as possible."
There are several logical steps that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yes, unfortunately, this is not practical for business calls lines, such as Sports City.
Stop unwanted calls.
Do not resist or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they may indicate you to someone who reacts and bury you in more speeches.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use calls blocking applications.
If you have concerns about privacy, check the application rules to see if it shares your call or contact information with distributors.
Do not provide phone calls with personal information such as a bank account or a social security number.
Rasmus Mägi: Preparation hasn't been exactly as I saw in the eyes of the spirit.
"Everything hasn't been exactly the way I saw it in the eyes of the spirit," he told the training of the mountain's MM.
Friday-Saturday, there are important moments that show how the body is exactly.
And the competition will show you what we're going to do here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both in this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run from everything.
There has been no special event on Sunday, after the 13.05 premiere of Estonia, since home championships.
In the last few weeks, training often hurts.
Freshness should have me and it might be very useful that the last week before MMi was a little easier.
On the physical side, the days left to the take-off go like this: last night the obstacle runner rested, today it takes a warming exercise.
In his spiritual preparation, he does not want to get very hard, but he says, "I don't have my routines in time.
There's a lot of silence and peace and no rock music I don't shoot on my ears.
I don't need to look at any motivating videos or self-help students, but to be here and at this moment to assess that the athletes around the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
It already in itself creates a speciality.
MM has, of course, been a year's top event for each mild-powered player, and the mountain has taken every previous launch, including competitions in the Thematic League, as a test -- tried some technical dynasty, compared to some competitors.
There is no longer a chance to experiment at the title competitions.
"Here's the goal is just to run quickly", says Mägi, but adds that if the premiere and potentially the half-final will succeed in saving a percentage or a few of the energy, they will certainly benefit in the next run.
The Finnishs had a dance party for their men.
When the first men's dance party was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers probably couldn't dream of taking an example from the small town of Estonia.
Today, however, the first dance of Finnish men is held in Western Finland.
"The representatives of the town of Lapua were so enthusiastic about the last man dance party in Rakvere, that you wanted to organise something similar," said Cairit Pihlak, Deputy Mayor Rakvere.
"This is what happens today in Finland at Lapua's baseballadion in the framework of the 100 festivals in Finland, 2 performances for the Man-Tance Festival, with 100 men from Virumaa," Pihlak said.
According to Pihlaku, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two towns of friendship.
It also celebrates the jubilee years of Estonia and the Republic of Finland.
Among the hundred dancers, Rakett 69 winners in Karl Reinkubja.
"I have the honour to be one of the hundred men who are presenting their participation in Finland for what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"Rakvere dancing men have set up all their joints in the process of preparing the Finnish men's dance to show a proper level at the bottom neighbours", commented also by a member of Rakvere's municipality, Ain Suurkaev.
The performance of Virumaa men has been made whole by the artistic leader of Tarvanpää, Tiiu Mürk, a well-known choir leader, Elo Üleoja.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian chore music.
The first Estonian men's dance party was held in 2006 and so far the last one in Rakvere.
In waiting for the final of the evening's disk emissions: does Gerd Kanter make the history of the MM?
The current MM is eighth for Kanter, none of his competitors in London has reached such a achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only disk emitter through history who has won the full set of medals ( gold, two silver and two bronzes) from MM.
Today (August 5, 2017), Kanter is 38 years old and 92 days old.
If an Estonian casts himself into a double world champion, he will become the oldest disk-shooter who has won the gold medal on the MM.
Pjotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days) is the same option as the Polish rapist.
More exciting facts:
The World Champion of Kettaheite has come more than one time by athletes in just two countries.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania has two.
The record of World Championships belongs to Virgilijus Alekna, which is issued in Helsinki (2005).
The lowest result with which the title has been won is 66.20 - it succeeded in Riede (In 1991).
The findings of the investigation show that cockroaches are also spreading seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroach seeds are spreading.
These insects are mainly known as breakers, which help to dismantle the decaying substances under the forest.
But thugs also help to spread their seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that cockroachs play an important role in the distribution of seeds to the monotropastrum of the forest.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophylls, therefore it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species becomes nutrients of mushrooms growing underground.
The plant stores small flavourless and pale white fruits on the forest base.
The fruits have very little taste or no flavor, and Japanese scientists found that birds and mammals are not interested as a source of food.
Only a handful of vertebrates consumed cereal meat and wooden brown Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruit.
Researchers checked the feces of the torches to determine whether these insects would help spread the seeds of the plant.
Researchers found that every fecal tomp emitted after eating the fruit had an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species has probably learned to exploit the ability to disseminate rosary seeds in evolution.
The crops of the plant hang near the ground, and they are ready at the same time as the cockroaches leave their rhino.
Researchers published their findings this week in Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"In view of the fact that around 4600 cockroaches have been identified so far, the distribution of seeds by rodents can be much wider and so far simply un documented mechanism, not just the unique skill of a certain species of plants to use browns," said co-professor of the University of Kumamoto, in the press release of Naoto Sugiura.
"It is hoped that the discoveries published encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to look for more examples of how tonic seeds are spreading."
The Princess of Cambridge's childhood should have had a "right to die"
According to his mother, a childhood friend with a fatal disease in Cambridge’s Duke should have been allowed to end his life.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duke's gaid group, begged after three years of fighting with a brain tumor that caused him a "extra pain, suffering, and loss of dignity" to allow him to die.
In the 34-year-old woman with cerebral paralysis, a brain tumor was diagnosed in 2014, but she suffered terriblely before she eventually died in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, Newbury, Berks, has been called upon to amend the law that would allow people with mentally competent disease to control their deaths.
He said his daughter's tormentful death caused him a serious trauma, and he wanted the law to allow him to set up a plan that would have allowed her daughter to die dignifiedly when her condition deteriorated.
Chinese internet sensors play a complex cat and mouse game
According to experts, there is a shift that could affect a large number of users from researchers to businesses that China is increasingly concerned about the power of the Internet.
"It seems that restrictions are becoming increasingly intense, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever before," said Emily Parker, who has written a book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are" on the Internet's influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the power of the internet in China.
According to experts, Chinese control has not yet been maximised and in many cases the cat and mouse game will continue.
One day after Apple's move last week, people began to spread in Chinese social media how to access the tools that are so simple that it can even be a technical stranger.
This covered the registration of a person's applications store in another country where the applications of the VPN are still available.
Nevertheless, the Thursday test shows that China wants to change the game for the benefit of a cat.
On Thursday, several Chinese Internet Service Providers said on their social media accounts, websites or e-mails that Chinese security officials test a new way to find online addresses for services hosting or using illegal content.
If they are found, the authorities request that online service providers require their customers to terminate such activities.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials shall interrupt their connection with minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not reply to a faxed request to comment on the matter.
Studies suggest that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPN and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
Although the blocking of foreign television and pornography blocks many people, they present only small challenges to the large community of online users in China.
The Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for the new online control elements over the years, but has also highlighted technology and the internet as critical factors in the future economic development of China.
Since cyberspace has started to play a key role in the whole part of China, government control elements have developed.
It is difficult to identify the scope of new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing to become a party to the Chinese government.
However, some frequent users have said that avoiding restrictions is becoming more and more difficult.
One student who studied in the United States and returned to China to spend summer holidays said that his local VPN is blocked.
According to her, she took this period away from some kind of social media of meditation, and she left a message to her friends in Facebook to explain why she was like falling underground.
A doctorate at a Chinese University of Environmental Engineering said that without Google Eastern, research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications that students do not always need an internet.
According to him, he has now found a new way to pass the Great Firewall, without revealing what it is.
According to Chinese online observers, some VPNs are still working and China would be able to do much more to intensify restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do this, it would have stopped the use of the VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a website created in 2015 that will help users in China to find a working VPN, a representative.
"If the government had sent out more cats, the mice would be much more complicated," said the representative who refused to name himself as a group's work because of sensitiveity in China.
"Well, they didn't do it because they had to leave people or businesses a little breathing space."
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current atmosphere is partly due to the immediate important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the 19th Congress of the party in the autumn.
Five years ago, VPN was hit by unpredictable interruptions before a similar meeting.
Like economic policy or external affairs, China is also a major part of a difficult and often lacking political process.
According to analysts, government ministries feel pressure from the party congress to show that they are effective and are able to interfere with the problem.
"This is definitely not the apocalypse of the VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the global technology department of the Eurasia Group.
"A more complex environment for accessors and new opportunities and approaches will simply allow China to switch out certain parts of the VPN use at the time and place selected in Beijing," he said.
The Chinese population learns to cope with these difficulties in the past.
Earlier this summer, the Chinese internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 are allowed to play a popular web game "Honor of Kings", allowing it to be done an hour a day for those who are younger than 12, and two hours for those who are 12 to 18 years old.
Therefore, Chinese young people have started to use the ancient solution - fake documents.
Is your "Honor of Kings" toy time restricted?
Are you interested in getting a document that shows that you are older than 18?" asked a recent advertisement in Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact us to obtain cheaply a document."
Estonian heavy horses will be evaluated tomorrow at the agricultural museum
On Saturday, August 5, the Estonian Agricultural Museum will take place the Day of the Estonian Heavy Safeguards.
Estonia’s heavy driver is one of the three Estonian horse rises next to the Estonian horse and tower horse.
The Dangerous Dangers Day will take place 23 times this year, and 17 heavy-vehicle threats will be present throughout Estonia for the annual event of the work horses.
On that day, young Estonian heavy horses, tattoos and wet horses are compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work carried out by the best breeders is recognised.
A total of more than 350 heavy horses in Estonia are the victims of the breed.
The maintenance of breeding and the use of horses is also presented in Ülenurm.
On the same day, you can visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, visit the EV100 cereal peenra and ruin farm and participate in the thematic workshops.
The activities are found by visitors of all ages.
Children are having exciting games, the opportunity to ride a pony or a horse, participate in the drawing competition and visit the Science Theatre of the Three Pigs.
There is also a souvenir where Estonian food and handicraft are offered.
Estonia's Dangerous Dangerous Dangers Day is jointly organised with the Estonian Hobuse Adults Society, the branches of Estonian heavy-vehicle breeders and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian Society of Tõulooma is supported by breeders.
The cat from the cancer cat, Genie, was called a cat of the year.
A rescued cat who was supported to his owner during bone cancer treatment was called a cat of the country's year.
Genie was recognized because he comforted his owner, Evie Henderson from Lincoln (11), during six chemistry sessions.
Evie was diagnosed in March 2016 and the Genie Society helped her to cope with several painful operations and long-term time in the hospital.
The cat recognized the cat charitable organization Cats Protection at the ceremony in London.

"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," Evie said.
"He came to my foot in my kips and sat next to my legs.
He sniffed the chip and then jumped on the couch to punch my knees with his hands on my knees.
When I was too sick to get friends to come or go out, and I had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me much happier, offering me great comfort."
According to Evie, he has a special connection with his pet, which was a huge support for him when he lost his hair because of the exhausting treatment.
"It really pissed me off because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie had the same hair and that I lost my hair and Genie's own, she kind of relaxed all this shock."
Evie's father Chris Henderson said that the cat has been a "great attention scatter" and described how Evie used to watch her favorite videos in the hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered him something to expect when he got home for a few valuable days."
11 years old said, "I miss him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said he misses me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him."
Report: Mueller summoned the jury's collection in Russia's investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that the Special Prosecutor of the Russian and Donald Trump presidential campaign on possible ties has summoned the jury's collection.
The report states that the jury's collection is a new and significant progress in the investigation of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller as regards whether Trump or his main advisors held secret advice with Moscow to promote the Presidential campaign of Republicans in 2016.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, the former FBI director, who is now in charge of this critical investigation, prosecutors of the former national security advisor Michael Flynn and Trump, as part of the investigation of Paul Manafort's former campaign leader, had been used by the jury collections.
One of the president's private lawyers John Dowd told NBC News he wasn't aware that Mueller started using all the jury.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since 1 June, because we'd like to get this thing together," he said.
"There is no reason for us to believe that President Trump is under investigation in the background of the all-convention news of the federal jury."
The NBC News has not confirmed the Journal data independently.
The use of all the jury is an ordinary part of a complex investigation, and it is not a tool intended only to listen to certificates, but also to obtain information and to obtain information from individuals or companies.
It's a powerful tool that the prosecutors can use to apply for prosecutions and prosecutions, and this may indicate that Mueller's work has not been done far.
Trump has denyed that he or any member of his team held a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied the role of playing Trumpi in a surprising victory last year in November.
The President's Special Adviser Ty Cobb said that he was not aware that Mr Mueller has started using the whole of the new jury.
"The hostile body is usually secret," said Cobb in the statement.
The White House is in favour of everything that will speed up his work fairly.
The White House is fully committed to co-operation with Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey has said three times that the President is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"A flying American" under the black sail
Of course, I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't be?
The Tibers visit the difference between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foiling" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Arrow to the market in 1952.
Technology was already in existence, but right now, I'm in front of the wind force.
Yes, it is, but still a sailboat.
What formula would that blow up with?
Let us, however, save ourselves from the formula (this is not difficult to find) and look at the "foiling" concept of a simple farmer.
Why keep the planes in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the plane continues at high speed, the wing under and above flowing air causes the difference in pressure due to the aerodynamic lifting force, at one point it exceeds the mass of the plane and lifts the entire machine.
The same process is essentially carried out in water.
The wing with the right shape generates lift forces on the high speed and, in turn, lifts the "twisted" base out of the water.
It's easy, right?
It's going to be difficult to get to the numbers.
The plane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 kilometres of hour to rise, the world record of sailboat speed is now "nice" 121.1 km/h.
But let us not go into high school physics!
Today I've come to see the "flying" catamaran called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is summarised in the headlines of the name North-American Catamaran Racing Association.
The FCS is an abbreviation of the Flight Control System.
This is a system that allows the team to set the base also in the middle of the "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sailboat in the feet.
As soon as the catamaraan is released from the cover, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday sailboat.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest were on board today.
Pipe and glasses didn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
It's Speed in Cuban.
"It's carbonity?" I ask the sailing.
Yeah, it's all carbonity.
"Then all the purse?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat," sounds a little bit of an answer.
170 kilos - the three of us on board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm comparing everything from the laundry seed to the cars for the evening, and I can't even get around here -- NACRA F20 is like an inappropriate boob for the street ride.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Equipped for one specific objective - to travel well-goodly quickly under controlled conditions.
The person who loves hobby sailor would also cool the number of security equipment that must be put on before going to the sea.
Waterproof suit, buckets, special-resistant beans, sailboats, arms, special lifeguard, helmet.
In battle equipment, it feels like the oxygen balloon in addition to and as well as the sea could also go to the Mars' colonisation.
"Well, there's a great chance to go around?" I ask a funny voice.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still sonning the surface.
Okay, that's not gonna be a joke.
I'm gonna fix the seat belt.
It also emphasises the importance that Nacra F20 FCS needs aid boats and, at least, two crew members to get to the sea.
Maximum three, so there's not much room to play.
It's about to start with why it's not a Sunday cruise.
Leiil Forest stories " Blog Archive " Earth and road repairs
For once, all the work on earth will remain in my mind, whether in the woods or in the field.
Machinery and quality of work have improved significantly and everything will take place more quickly than at their own time.
Currently, mostly land healing objects are reconstructed, searching for errors and congestions, and improving them.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which have not been taken into account decades ago.
Construction materials are renewed, for example, for the construction of trups instead of previous iron concrete tubes, and for couplings in addition to stones, the so-called geotextile.
Priorly, mouths and trups were secured with poured concrete plates (MP, VKP) and rotters.
In order to protect the environment, sediments for natural streams or rivers shall be digested before the entry of drying waters (ground underground drenes, craws) are removed from the residues of agricultural fertilisers and toxins.
The bottom of the new sediment basins or stitches is often planted or grown from the seeds that flew there.
The wolves have a quality to filtrate toxic substances from water.
The twin on the picture was digged last year and this week a well was built from the concrete rings to take firewater.
And so that some machine doesn't crash into the wings, the large stone noises on the edge of the place were, yes.
There is also an improvement in the forest roads next to the cleaning of the field grains in the surroundings.
The intersection between forests on the picture should be part of the unleashing road, which will also be available for additional roast coats.
There will be a state forest on the right, which will be reconstructed immediately from the top of the slope to the right and which will soon be ready.
There's a private forest.
The vallatee is moving on, and there is also going to be a modernisation of the agricultural grains and roads, and the correction of the drying errors that have become apparent.
