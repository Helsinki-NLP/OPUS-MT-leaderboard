Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, President Vladimir Putin accused Kiova of denying direct political discussions with the Separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
The leadership of Kiev at this moment does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of his country, Putin said the news office Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-spirited separatists, which are said to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops away from their moments where Putin said that the Ukrainian troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of the military fighters is to push away these armed forces and their armed forces so that they can't shoot people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Firehouse.
I was surprised that the people came from the beginning of the night.
There were visitors in two days expected, Promotor Tom Kangas says.
The Hiphop Festival of the wall was organised for the third time.
Next year, again.
We're still going to be hiphop festivals, which means there's no poppi, Kangas will convince you.

In the future, individuals shall apply for authorisation from the Police Government to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called explosives source.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitrathane, nitrogen acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the concentrations are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is in cleansing and washing agents, but the concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, precursors obtained before the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioliiga: Super Rahem glorious - Mario stayed in shadow - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he was considered a hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when the stronger Liverpool on Mario Balotelli arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first presentation was promising: experienced English journalists saw an Italian 24-year-old work on the field at a very different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way away from his top-line.
The Italian lost three high-quality sites and fed only half of its sixteen feeds to his own team.
The pool collectors that have already taken the player's favorite will continue to expect a better one.
Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona, traveling to Luis Suarez as a second attacker next to Daniel Sturrridge.
Instead of Balotell, the team was staring at the top of the middle field diamond, Raheem Sterling, who pushed the 3-0 win along the important opening painting of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just shining.
The Englishman is 20 cent shorter than the fish in water between the opponent's lines.
The feature is not common to a player, who runs the grass at its best about 34 kilometers an hour.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for the development of Sterling.
The Northern Irishman, after the match, explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a Northwestern-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-With-N.

The Rovaniemi women's balloon league team, Woman Volley, confronted the lion climber of Vampula Sporters at the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned five to one of the stretched matches for the winning of 3-2.
The last round WoVo lost between 15 and 11.
The neighbor was a step ahead of us all the time.
The fight was good, but in defense and passport, Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo Coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's six was so brutal that the 190-center American sentiment Jennifer Keddy was stuck on his back.
As a center, Sara Niemi played.
In spite of his thumb horse, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed Johanna Pekkarisen with WoVon's most fierce combination.
Jenna Keskmäki, who started the hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 lot.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian passport and libero Hillaelina Spider, which WoVo roamed as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next week when the HPK of Hämeenlinna comes to the training camp in Rovaniem.
The team meets on Saturday at the "kappis" at 18 a.m. in the official training game.

Lidl's insane figures in Finland
The net sales of Finland's shops grew by almost 25 per cent during the financial year ending at the end of February to almost EUR 1.2 billion.
The company published its results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that the last accounting year paid taxes to Finland almost EUR 14 million.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovary cancer is more likely to be killed due to late diagnosis and difficulty in access to treatment in rarely populated areas.
Angelina Jolie and his brother James have published a video for honor to his mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers examined the patient data of more than 1100 Australian women who received ovarian diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis.
From Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in fewly populated and distant areas died by 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
CHARACTERISTICS: New medicines may slow down the lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status had an impact on the possibility of survival.
In older women and with cancer, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in rarely populated and distant areas died by 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside towns have a less probability to cope with ovarian hives, but Jordan considers it possible to cause delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"Gynecological oncology specialists are doing this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," says Jordan.
While remote treatments are becoming generalised and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can handle patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients with distant home care.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the percentage of long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of their geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a family mother in Gold Coasti, Elisha Neavella, a malignant ovarian cancer was observed.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the stationary formation of sparkling activities in the Friendship Park, which is next to the hotel Northhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its nearby environment would be placed at the service point of Osviit to be publicly visited.
The draft opinions are requested from the Environment Committee and from the Lapland Living Centre.
With a change in position design, the city wants to enable the tourism-related motorcycles to continue in the area.
It is intended to form a park area that includes the existing Park of Friendship and the region between it and the river.
During the period from 15 November to 30 April, no more than 200 engine beams shall be placed on the site.
In addition, tanking points may be invested in a specified part of the area.
The new park area is also allowed to operate.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies for motorcycles during winter time.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the contract is in force until spring 2018.
Kelkaparking and change in the form have also led to intense opposition.
Neighbourhood residents have been in their heels as well as in their concern for emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and no observations have been made beyond the guidelines.
The renovated equipment is even lower than the old.
The park as a parking lot also supports the fact that if the place of departure would be moved further, the safari customers of the hotel should be transported to the safari destinations on buses estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of friendship park and the surroundings are also sufficiently widespread, better than the locations presented for replacement departures, such as the east side of the bridges of the Ounas River.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, for example in the future, because activities can expand, for example, in the Ounaspavilion region.
Strengthening parking is part of the urban strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, that the city aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business by providing sufficiently high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable places.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the point of departure of motor driving in the central sub-general, which has not yet received legal power.
The decline in ownerial dwellings is displayed in garden stores
The reduction in the number of housing owners, in particular in the group under 35 years of age, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, when young consumers today reach their age for the "primary target group". Financial Times reported the study of the United Kingdom Trade Association for Gardens (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, only 55% of the money used by residential owners is spent on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in very urban dwellings with no gardens, and the size of the garden is reduced, when the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking lot, and these factors also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about GBP 5 billion per year.
In the area of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and the least money is spent on garden products per household in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the United Kingdom Gardens Association (RHS), the increase in housing rental or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The leading garden counselling of the RHS Guy Barter says that "for example, plants grown in transferable farming facilities are particularly popular among dwelling rental agents, because such cultivation can be included in change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flowering period of resale in the garden sector, as the ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the end of the 80s to half of the 90s.
The report also predicts that this year, due to better weather conditions, trade is rigorous after last year's March and April weather.
Turkey is interviewing the United States diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on the American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulenti, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The Intercept of the German Der Spiegel magazine and website The Intercept have written that Edward Snowden's former analyst of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveals that Turkey was the main spy destination of the US and the UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the report, saying that all large countries have spyed on each other.
The previous report on the spying of the main German intelligence service in Ankara led to a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.

Commander Mallorcan Magaluf, accused of corruption.
The public prosecutor of Mallorca submitted evidence of blackmail by the police and the Calvià City Government at the State Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Calvià's chief of police on the Mallorca holiday island has been arrested as a result of the corruption charges of the traders and bar owners of the known Magalufi region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was imprisoned after several movements of the Punta Ballena street were prosecuted against him. The Punta Ballena street is located most of the Magalufi bars and night clubs.
According to Mallorca Diario, the online newspaper, which was published, showed evidence of the blackmail of the police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interrogated by a judge with Navarro.
The ABC of all countries wrote about the neutrality of the hated authorities of the nightclub owners, which significantly undermined their business.
"The issue is no longer money, but the survival," said a motion owner to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in many countries this summer in the magazine titles, when you spread online the YouTube video, where a 18-year-old British holidaykeeper had sex with 24 men called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to control the humiliated and uncontrolled use of Magalufi lobbyers by reducing the number of notorious, alcoholic pub crawls involved.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the footwear video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the pub crawl organiser, Carnage, were assigned to pay the fines of EUR 55 000 together.
Above all, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists has also been recommended by the so-called balconing practice, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol use when people have jumped from the balcony to another or balcony to the hotel pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of the children of Israel in the Gaza Strip returned to school Monday after spending the summer in bombing shields, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the 50 - day wars of Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed in the recurrence of battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the bombing of rockets in the southern Israeli communities, but the traces of battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod, the south, Pashosh day home, workers removed the fragments from the walls and slipped before the children arrived after the rocket hit into the daycare.
"We are a little scared, but we are also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts called Saad, Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area urgently need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, feels like getting back to school for a long time.
"We've had difficult times when we didn't go from home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbuts, near the Gaza border, offering its support.
Before last week's fire break, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saji had stayed indoors or left their homes farther from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the community of Nahal Oz located near the front of Gaza are suspected of return after the death of a four-year-old son in the community of the Palestinian grenade.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be ensured".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the existing ceasefire last Tuesday.
The fire strike immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as the Hamas demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt from the blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaways.
Israel wants to take away the weapons of Hamas and restore the body of the two armed Israeli soldiers who fell in war.
In Egypt, the beginning of a new round of indirect negotiations is expected later this month.
Palestinian and UN estimates that over 2 100 Palestinians died in war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, which says at least half of the dead were soldiers, although he had no evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the side of Israel, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other gaza soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and granates in the cities of Israel mostly in the south.
On the other hand, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated at 250 000 people fled to over 100 UN schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and battles continued, school authorities moved the beginning of the school last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old living in a school in Gaza.
According to the generally used meter, the prices of apartments have risen most for seven years in the winter months in Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings in Australia’s capital dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August, revealed RP data on Monday.
As a result, during the summer, July and August, the increase in prices was 4.2 per cent, or more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but has not increased evenly throughout the country.
According to the RP Data Research Director, Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelate, Brisbane and Darwin is next to the strongest; the average price increase is from 5 to 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia increases the number of dwellings in sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In the light of the increase in sales of apartments to be auctioned, the overall strong sales pace and the still low interest rates, it is likely that the price of dwellings will continue to increase over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mäntta
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences this summer in Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have been visited at the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been pop art classical works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntin's artistic weeks once again told me that he had made a visitor record on Monday, when 14,500 visitors had visited this summer.
These figures have not been used to.
The people have sneaked out of doors and windows," says the director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors this year will be approaching hundreds of thousands in Serlachius museums.
There have been some 40 000 visitors in previous years.
There are about 11 000 residents in Mänttä-Vilppula in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
The museum director Sivonen reminds me that the new museums are always opening phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue long over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Museum of Art.
The police are investigating four stolen days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night in the Northlankadu, the business property was broken by breaking the window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Deep River Street had stolen fuel from a truck tank.

On Sunday night on the Tikkapuron road, the business property was breached.
The police dog got a copy and a 20 Paltamo man was found hiding under the woods in the woods.
On Monday, the police picked up another man from Paltamo who was also suspected of being committed to the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of a ten grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge to a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his open-second and another man and shot a shotgun to export drugs to his suspect dwellingholder, a 34-year-old kayan woman.
The defendant disputed the prosecution and claimed that he was with another man as a shooter.
The case came to the police when the police police stopped a passenger car with a group burning the clothes used for bloodwork.
In addition to the burned garments, a cut shotgun was found in the car.
The court of the Cainu will give a judgment in the case later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Air Science Institute, the same warm August is repeated on average once in 10 years.
The statistics show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
Most of the country’s deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the pearls of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the gauge was 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in a seven - year - old family of migrants from Jamaica in Dudley in the United Kingdom in Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on his father's imaginary discussion and which has been developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The sound is a mix of reggae and rapping in the upbeat tattoo.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he has much thought about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His face was never seen, just the voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub and discussed, for example, the form of beer or the beauty of cricket feed.
I never talked to him about that kind of stuff.
Most of my life he was to me the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal feather in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are now better than at that time.
The melting houses are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoked, labyrinthful depths that spill flames, smoke and nodes, and bring back that to mind.
My father used to go to a bath and just lie down in a bath, and slowly he began to sing himself by washing away the dirt of the meadow from himself.
As I walked around the melting house, I realized that he had worked for years to get us a table of food, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me, never told me he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to repeat each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter of Billie with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that she lacked as a child.
Do you keep saying, "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why don't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, who he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
He's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one reason that led to my mother's death.
When I began to suffer from excessive overweight and diabetic symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may perhaps describe his change during career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics from his role as Othello, he has drowned into doing the theater.
The next shift was the comedian of the misunderstandings and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making a theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and the comets Henry has done all the time in his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was only 16 years old at the factory.
One dishwasher noticed him on the stage doing simulations and contacted the New Faces Competence Competition.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "How long was I the only black imitator and comic in the TV," she says.
Henry learned work.
I had to grow up in the light of the public, I had to learn to produce jokes from the slippers in 1975-1985, while living on the star and on the television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights for the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program, where people appeared as black makeups, so Henry ended up in a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I would never have participated in it, but I will not regret it.
Although my position was strange and devastating, I was able to work in huge events and learn how the audience was treated.
Yet the "British-Tv rewarded, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program" was also "sweetly parody of black people".
Henry worked in a second comedy series in the '80s, where both jokes were made and admired black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known as a cook of Gareth Blacklock in a comedy series of Chef!
After the next decade, Henry spent ads, documents, TV series and film parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just on your spot or on side tracks."
The next time, there was a documentary show on Radio 4 "What's So Great About...?"
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us properly at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears stockings and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme woke me up with fear.
All the persons we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Tell me.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You know, you know, you're dating words, and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 pieces of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost seemed like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your rope, do a little background research.
So the exercise process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
Obviously it was expected to fail, but that did not happen.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part in the Comedy of Mistakes.
All of a sudden, I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I remembered the idea: "Oh, you've changed."
One time the play had technical problems, and Henry felt clearly that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the proposal would be continued as soon as the problem was corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me spoiled the relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to teach the "Fences" screen.
Panic is a good thing. It makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well accepted, so it was like a sign of the gods; “This is what you must do.”
This is what Henry says with noise, of course.
So I decided to stay here.
I love this job sincerely.
I love rehearsal rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comic: the small humor sons are constantly interrupting our discussions when he switches from imitation to one.
The issue of a willingness is the arrest of the stand-up comics, since the immediate recognition of the unknown public seems to be dangerous.
If you keep yelling at it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it doesn't inspire me in the same way as before.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to a new stand-up tour.
I find real joy in sitting with a director who helps me to change the whole journey from the beginning, the middle and the end, and I do not think that I will ever give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The show keeps telling the story, and that's where I enjoy it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenia is preparing a register of officials to remove "gun workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of officials trying to remove "gun workers" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not sign up in the register during the next two weeks no longer receive any remuneration, were notified in the Government Communication.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid wages after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to dismantle public sector corruption after entering office in 2013.
According to the previous audit this year, at least a million dollars were spent monthly on the salaries and other economic abuses of ghost workers.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his office, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairob.
All officials shall report themselves to the register in the identification centres during the following weeks in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric format, was reported in the Government's communication.
According to the Communication, all those who fail to do so shall be removed from the salary lists.
"This measure makes significant sense to the public sector, as this defines how many people really work for their responsibilities, and thus cleansing wage lists at both levels of the government, and so solves the problem of "having workers", says Anne Waiguru, official of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Design.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Seinäjoki may remain a deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adapts its activities and expenditure to a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual period is about 9.4 million deficits.
The potential enhancement of the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and grant of assets, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
From the 10 million euros of investments, the quantum target is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed by the municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenue, the increase in unemployment and the 5% cut in the State shares will further weaken the prospects.
The aim of the economic campaign is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into a strategy target, says the President of the City Government, Kim Heinone.
The City Government returned the proposals made to prepare the management group.
The proposals of the City Government are based on the preparation of the budget at the Delegation's Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the draft budget moves to the city government and to the City Council through the boarding process.
Ten Turkish police arrested as suspects of "jun" against the government
All 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "prosecution against government", the local media sources tell us.
The police didn't comment immediately.
According to Hurryyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers among the arresters.
Some police officers were involved in last December's corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising a large criminal belt and monitoring the phones.
The President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the Prime Minister during that time) said that the police’s activities are part of the activities planned against him and the others in power of the Islamist Director Fethullah Gulleni.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the earth for future generations:
The first of September ceremony was not spent in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the immense Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexandra Pastukhov, who is the leading teacher at Slaviansk School where Yatsenyuki's daughter comes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children’s dressed shirts, balloons and the provision of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the twitting twit was unauthorized.
On Sunday evening, a disgraceful picture of the District Attorney of Democrats was sent from a confirmed Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry in Texas, in the midst of this hearing, of accusations of misuse of power.
The Tweet was removed later and followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
"I do not accept the tweet and I have removed it," said the later publication.
Perry's backup teams did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's not clear who published the picture.
The first twiit included a stunning picture of Travis' district attorney at Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced for a racing drink in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, which led to the large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times larger than allowed, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for showing her finger."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead to a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special attorney in San Antionio, appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal assistance team has asked the defendant to reject the accusations and said that the law on the basis of which the governor in Texas is accused of being the most inhabitant is unambiguous against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of state aid to the State’s public non-injurious unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
The decision of Perry received an official complaint by the Surveillance Group on the left.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After getting to the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the game by publishing a picture on Twitter on its own, flying on the lake, with the text "This is where South-Carolina come".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of the main buildings in London has warned that the south-east-east-England housing market has "burned" to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London’s dwellings have been troubled by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread loan coupon, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder of Berkeley and President of the high-level builder, said that "from the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the 2013 pie" and added that this has enabled the "standing operating environment".
During the recession in the London housing market, foreign investors went well by flock to the capital.
According to the country register, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose in the fifth year before, reaching a GBP 423 000 increase by the end of April.
However, the reinforced pound has made London's property a less attractive object in the last few months - part of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric of any "charter tax" before the general elections of May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage loan report, which reported more stringent lending orders, would lead to a lower market growth in terms of both the volume of real estate sales and the prices in the second half of the year.
The recent information of the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, which refers to cooling housing markets.
The Hamptons International real estate broker has calculated its 2015 forecasts of London's property prices, according to which prices are falling by three per cent, as the index of housing owners' views on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas in London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter ago, says WA Ellis, the real estate broker.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who raised income from the real estate sold to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-planned, right product in the best places has remained stable and therefore the sales have remained vigorous".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3 742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than the time before the economic crisis in 2007.
Yearly profits before taxes increased by 40% per year to GBP 380 million and turnover increased by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley told me that Berkeley's year's earnings correspond to the current expectations of the market.
The analysts agree that the profits before taxes are 450 million GBP throughout the year.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold GBP 23.96 evenly at the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have a hundred other stars of photos on the Internet was leaked by the Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's skinny pictures on the Internet.
The representative of the star of hunger confirmed that the pictures are real and condemned the hacker's "insult of smuggling privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images originally published on the 4chan page were apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. There are tens of other marshmen, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
We don't know how much of the pictures are real, although Scott Pilgrim against the World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at the pictures of me and my husband in private in our homes years ago, hopefully you have a good time," Winstead twiitta.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series nevertheless banned the authenticity of the images and tweeted them that "this so-called naked images of me are naked, you don't understand".
Let me finish this right at the beginning.
On Sunday, BuzzFeedin announced that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande forbade the authenticity of the pictures on the star.
The only thing we've ever seen is Howard Jacobson's thanks for the new novel that tells us about love and j.
They dissolved, it best pictured what happened, they gradually pulled out of each other than a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only occasionally he heard from a woman that was too serious, difficult, intensive, dissolved, and perhaps a little slimy.
That's when he twisted his hand.
He recognized the skull.
Yeah, he was slimy, like a silicon.
His last victim at the beginning had had been a relationship that had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have made his lonely boredom easier, and it might have brought his life even to some content.
Ailinn Solomons had unsustainable hair, and he was a delicately delicate beauty with a happy heart, a village in the north, which was still furry and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with an older travel partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt, aunt had inherited a house in a moist but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes bleed, all the bathrooms had spiders, and the ducks had left their tracks in the windows, keeping the entire place their own; in the garden, weeds grew, which reminded the giant cabbages.
The cabin was like the rain of children, at the same time threatening and spectacular, the garden full of secrets.
Published by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the terms of the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long hawk, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening scatteredly to the reception through which the whole country heard calm music and calming news, when Ailin's crossed the sun brown feet brought in the mind of Kevern, which had long ago been forgotten by the black performers, and which his father had often listened to in the cabin under.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive, and they were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually banned — they were no longer called.
They wanted to be forgotten, as did the word unholy.
The public opinion brought about what was not achieved by law and by the declaration: just as in the corner of literature, people chose to read hero memoirs, cooking books and romances, for music they favour ballades.
During today's wild day, Kevern began to play a figurative piano and sing serenad to Ailn's big legs with a arrogant voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of Fats Waller, Jazzpianist," Kevern told him, and he raised two fingers in nature before his mouth.
This is how his father had always done before the "j" letter had time to escape from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father told me he was playing the same game with his own father.
If you let the word begin with your mouth and didn't remember lifting two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a nickel.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even that.
He knew it was expected from him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of that.
Even Jazz was not actually declared forbidden, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to cleverness.
Its unforeseenness made people nervous.
And Jazz was the cleverness of the music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, the jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or forces either.
The famous society meant that each part of it was accepted thankful — thankful — that they had been saved like a happy store — the principle that each group had done natural things to it.
Based on their temperatures and physical characteristics, people with afro-carbic roots are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and run.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that each family had a mobile phone that was used to handle things.
Those left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When it was found in the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, when the grandparents had not fled vigorously in the fear that they would be accused of the blasting of flames and fearing that the flames would reach them next, they opened restaurants serving labneh-jogurts and burning water pipes, and continued to look into the earth as depressed and bored.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballades, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words of Kevern had never been dressed as music.
They expressed love through the music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big legs think.
My father never insulted anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound isolation of the magazines of giant cabbages.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"Dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn fell off his head as unbelievable, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailin's huge, crooked hairbeam.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say that once," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailin seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your nipple, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I think you're attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was completely different, because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm in which the cruelty of jokes can be ruled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his favorite eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and then poured down the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drinked.
The wine was made from the back, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shak like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is the thing that attracts me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessary cruel words and the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in a good northern archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been like life here.
The same huge, good sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, though after THE TIME, are even paleer and deviler than their smuggling and dispersive parents, traveled from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dares to oppose or torture them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
First, kissing had become the most common word of erotic encounters between men and women; then the antidote of unimportant loveballads pumping out the receiver — immerse first and attack.
Kevern thought that too was too much, because it was hostile to inspire himself.
The body language of Ailinn Solomons urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depths of Kevern’s grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling partner looked at Kevern’s way from the upstairs window — a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
I'm going out of the garden. He thought about it.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
A man who turned his back, despair, shameful, beaten, who had lost all the will of battle — why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he hadn't remembered that he had ever seen such things before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before just described the event, a smart and zealous 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the general opinion in Ofnow, carried out a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the countries where the reduction of violence, or the ending of violence, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to extract it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much has not yet been done," he wrote, "to be able to balance the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in the abandoned and outer corners, where, despite the church towers that go beyond the nests, human lempe has rarely been known in time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it creates.
The people are crying with the sentimental ballads, crawling stories about the controversial controversy and sworn in the name of the virtues of the marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps indefinitely taking both the country communities and the urban societies, and there is evidence of a new, more malicious conflict in homes, workplaces, streets and even play parks.
"You have to regret the tendency to dramatize," said his director after reading the whole report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sex and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this job.
We are servants of unprejudicial society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is fully acceptable and respectable in itself, it may sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church — and what you call cruel or malicious spirit — others usually call it natural energy and physical strength.
It's like yesterday, if it happened, the earth's fundamental vitality will be destroyed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while talking to Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingon-white LED light announced the instructions that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum answered quietly when it was certain that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will repeat the same mistakes that originally led to SILH, WHEN THE WORLD, WHEN WE WANTED.
This time, however, we do not leak our hatred and confidence in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid on his fingers.
This gesture meant infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you depict the deeds that our grandparents may have done or have not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they blew 'they anger and their confidence in others'.
In a position like you, it should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we do not talk about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about.
"If we are entirely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "No group of society can say that they have acted well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done, done, was good or bad.
It was that time.
We don't have to talk about it anymore – that's what we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make adjustments, were they appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what does the past exist for if it isn't learned --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," she said and expressed that Esmen was about to leave.
The next day, as usual, he was hit by a motorcycler driving on the sidewalk, described by the passers as "patient and rageful".
There's a lot of accidents going on.
The Lesotho Army denies its planned attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's military officials have refused to set up an attack to strike the government and said that they are acting against a police officer who was suspected to attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official dwelling and reigned government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The head of the state travelled to the neighbouring country in South Africa with his family, after telling us that he had been killed.
Major Ntle Ntoi, the army's representative, said that the army responded to this threat that came from "political fanatics", said the police tried to arm the fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after obtaining a number of intelligence data that some police forces are trying to arm young party fans when they are ready to cause problems," she told the Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, President of the South African Government, military activities appeared to be a revolutionary enterprise.
"Even though no body has claimed to have revoked the government by means of force, the Lesotho Defence Forces’ activities seem to be all the same as the signs of the revolutionary company," he says.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their archipelago on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading the government while Thabane is gone.
Thabane says that he believes he's under action because he's tried to fight corruption.
In Lesotho there have been tensions since June, when Thabane interrupted the parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements of the great coalition government.
He thus denys that he has reduced the power of the government, although otherwise claimed.
Trading: Microsoft will set up a data center for the new country
The company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Newland for a place where the company refuses to specify its location.
In the Microsoft Media Communication, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
For Microsoft, it's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the public, Oulua or Kajaan had been used to be the place of the centre.
Microsoft completes Oulu's office, which takes the job from about 500 people.
Overall, Microsoft has announced that he would resign up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft Communication Manager, says to STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The creation of the Data Centre to Newland was reported on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have several different device options to complain.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $ 350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules you should follow.
Always check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set camera description settings to match images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a setup to optimize the description conditions under water.
In addition – before you jump in the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras last only 5 feet, others up to 50-60 feet.
Explore both ordinary and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to compact the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to harness, which means taking multiple images at the same time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly decreasing.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures of a swimming pool, a lake or a sea.
In this way you will also get more colors; the more you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important advice in describing the land, but even more important underwater because the light conditions are low.
It is very important when you have an action camera: these devices often have a solid lens with a wide angle, i.e. the camera must be close to the target to fill the entire image frame.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates despite the growing democratic reform of 2017 elections.
The decision is likely to allow the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong after the activists started to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress to give communists practically the power to expel all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still disgusting," says the President of the democratic party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are working with an autonomous regime.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, Li Fei, defended the government of China, saying that the general candidate to be a leader in Hong Kong would be too "caotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised its residents to be able to choose their own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to China's leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through the appointment committee managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "lov and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In Hong Kong, during the summer preceding the decision, some of the largest and most remarkable protests in the region were organised for years.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to prevent the business of a block of business if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine general voting rights.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of the supporters of the Occupy Central Movement met in the rain before the main buildings in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organisers of the movement reported that the movement would move to a new era of civil discourse and would create protest waves in the next few weeks.
However, they did not apparently tell the details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In the communication published on the network, the organisers said that the business "to keep the Occupy Central lessons as a last way only to be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that the last opportunity for dialogue has been drawn and the take-up of the centre will take place today.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday, security operations were tight near the government main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, there is a feeling that many people are slowly losing their power in their city.
The wave of the people who arrived from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the increasing pressure in Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its manifestations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions — the world of business.
"The Protest they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it takes," says Regina Ip, the legislator, who has long criticised the business.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is about to smuggle away from us.
This kind of image would be bad for investing.

Your prom tradition in the United States is hitting the UK universities: to new students with private broadcasts
We are excited to respond to our demand by setting up the first UK luxurious travel form for students today.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure that the customer arrives as much as possible.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security perspective.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in extremely loaded cars.
When this is combined with many of the VIF characteristics (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transport to the university as possible.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has only been set up, but added that "the students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 pounds of academic fees.
Students today are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and wishes. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, a national student organization criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Vice-President Megan Dun, this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the majority of students.

Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin was faint on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the body of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his sysimus U.S. match and backed up the second half of the time with his static solutions.
But Salin gave all the honor to the susifans, and he did it with style:
I was going to fainte in that field at the end, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, my fog, nothing could do.
The noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine surfaces in fast pace, ball ribbons, discs and hammers wherever it was.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode like that, that everything worked out.
It's just that there's just someplace, right now, in an insanely important place, Sasu sparkled.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others got caught up in the case.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team cheerleader and a lifemaker, so it is no wonder that his example raised the whole team into a flight that was too much for the big and hard-core Ukraine five.
Finland in the MM races after 32 years of break: The last one remembered a brutal jury game
Heik Montonen (also) was the main coach of Finland at the MM tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's FBG team played the last time in the MM final tournament.

Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday's day: it was in the early stage a hot fight against France.
"In the balls of that match, the judge's game was brilliant," remembered Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the back line.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went more crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played chief coach Heikki Montosen in command and finally settled in 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's elections, when the Polish MM tournament takes place today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in the international balloon for 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there are more quality and skills now.
The median lengths of players have also increased.

The Finnish ministers saved the Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Thomas Soini boldly offered to help.
In the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank his helpers again.
In a public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told me that a Cita dog with her on the mountains on Thursday.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a sharp landscape.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to leave it alone.
I tried to attract and pull it a little further many times, but its legs were not just carrying, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said that there was no help from the police, no close hotel, no passers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation started to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two travelers who were ready to help: Antti Soini, the Tampere, and Judge of his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain of Norway in Galdhøpiggen and directed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively peaceful in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, and Antti Soini will tell me in a message sent to the Ilta-Sanoms.
Shortly there was also a German man with an excursion mat with him.
From the mattress to Citalle, there were pairs like the injured dog attached to.
The German man came by for a moment after us when we were wondering what to do with the dog and carry the dog for a moment in his arms down the slope, Soini says.
DESCRIPTION: Judge Soini
The dog was picked up with an excursion mat.
According to the Soin, performance was not physically difficult, but in a difficult landscape it was slow.
However, about an hour and a half later, Cita was happy to get down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still searching for "international heroes" in Facebook so that he could thank them again.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received joy from Mikkelsen: Cita says he's already feeling better!

Genetic abnormality is often wrongly diagnosed
The British woman feared death for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years to live because he was diagnosed with another disease.
Actually, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT), which means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases, because it is known so little.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in Britain suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motorcycles, such as muscle weakness, difficult walk and toes.
The disease can also cause insomnia or pain, and it is unparalleled and progressive, which means that the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was sick of Friedreich ataxia (FA) with a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers thought he was going to be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and died before he was 30 years old.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell daily and took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was tempted at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, several cuts were carried out to straighten his legs. In the course of surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but since I came home, I was thoroughly informed about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA association," she says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and in a panic-like state.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I could fill 25, and in the meantime, I'd slowly lose my entire power.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells us that by the age of 17 he said that his walk was not as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl love, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you suffer from something much less dangerous.
According to some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with a CMT disease.
"When I was told what the CMT disease was, I thought I was postponed," she says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The wishes of the basketball country team from the post are in the game when Finland meets today in the second match of the MM races in Ukraine.

Hollywood Stars' alleged subconscious images spread online - the part confirmed to be real
There are a number of naked images on the Internet that are alleged to be known publicity.
Among other things, an actor Jennifer Lawrence has been victims of the "feeling image campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a slight violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (Internet) pictures stolen by Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted by the representatives.
According to TMZ, an actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures spreading from him are real.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the terrible trouble they saw for this.
I feel compassion for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes according to the website.

Real or fake naked images are also moving at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticizes his own: "You don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Swing League.
Painting Walter Viitalan's comments after the Sunday VPS match are very confusing in the current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," said the reference to the 1-2 killed after the struggle.
In the first half of the fight, Honka made a lot of defense-head mistakes.
The painter's reference wasn't a bad defense game in his mind.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viita have changed in acceleration.
With the playground, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"The part does not work enough to get out of here sometimes", the Vitala crawled without nameing any single player.
Honga’s chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was to some extent in agreement with Viitalan.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to trainees and games to have fun, and you think you're a liga player, and you don't have to work, you must be in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given many young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players could not expect immediate success when their players changed constantly.
There has been no two consecutive compositions in this period.
Especially in the head of defense, people have changed.
That is the biggest reason why we are in this place," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, at the second level with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so the espoolans still have time to avoid falling to 1st.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We are certainly not going to fall out of this series," the goalkeeper Vitala threatened.

I mean, today was a great glitch.
This is what the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995 said when Finland had played the EM final tournament against France in the Balls Hall of Athens.
The Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when he was there.
They were also about 100 Finns who cried out of 20,000, or empty halls of noise.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraine match?
In Bilbao, there are troops of 100 Finnish fans eighty times.
EM-kisat 1995 was a Finnish basketball search time.
The men took their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian quarry fight at the Helsinki Sports House.
This victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hann Möttöla.
Chief Coach Henrik Dettmann picked Möttölä's lime line to the final tour team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a long way wise, even though everything didn't go well according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball country team dived deep.
In Athens’s races, Finns were known to be present with a total of over 100 Finns.
They included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coachers and some fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coachers, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I'm sure no one can say a precise number of Finnish competitionrs.
These estimates have moved between 7 500 to 10 000.
There was a figure between any one, it's totally incomprehensible.
This is an explanation for the sports societies.
In the global world economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to examine how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go see how our girls and sons succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physics.
Surely both in Spain and in the MM races of the balloon in Poland there are Finnishs who are applying for their lives.
Co-experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
You have to be attracted to sports, too.
Itkonen raises sports into a popular culture.
There's a lower threshold to go to sports games than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses still can't move.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when the coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to threw themselves in a professional sport.
It took almost ten years to do that.
Then the direction changed, and the country team's activities were put on foot.
Flightball forces did the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports where holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
That's when you're interested in the audience.
And the media has taught what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Are the types of balloons capable of transferring this massive interest to home series?
On average, basketball and balloons are played for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
The crying considers the question to be good and does not necessarily give an answer that would be very good for the species.
The second school believes that interest will move.
The other one is the one who doesn't want the sweet stomach full.
This group is ready to go to the MM races, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not twice interested.
There's a challenge for people who're in the middle of the drug.
Secure for the land - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the formula driver Valtteri Bottaksen beach home tons.
The Governing Board approved the delivery of 1.4 hectares at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
In the future, a free-time apartment will rise to the property.
In Nastola, Bottatta has been following the success of this caring period.
He's a good ambassador to market Lahte, the Lahde Region and Nastola.
The gift tont is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become the owner of the municipality of Nastola as part of the larger real estate store.
There are seven buildings in the area, of which the municipality will dismantle at the expense of six by the end of this year.
In formula 1, Bottas reached its fourth prize ball player this year in the Belgian competition.
He's at the MM on the fifth.
Bottas is born Nastolan and lived on the Vili source of childhood.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's out of shape.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and juvenile schools.
Design intelligence is coming, but hardly poor people.
It's presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the spheres of the field, but that's what amateur Marcus Giron, who is one of the tops of the college players.
He said that the shirt will help him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been tissued in the knitting shirt, from which information passes on to the blur on the shirt and from there on to the smartphone or to the table computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
Prior to throwing a shirt into the washing machine, a central unit is removed.
The fashion house has not spoken precisely to the start of the sale of the shirt and has not even suggested its price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company that's investing in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has sold smart shirts and smart hordes.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes pay 100 dollars a piece and the central unit of the thumb that they demand pays two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about technical clothes.
Smart way to save in the textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, found a smart way to save the costs.
He developed a system in which later class students lend their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books straight away.
"My book of mathematics would normally have paid 180 dollars; I paid 10 bucks for its use throughout the semester, and I used a sandwich," says Schroeder, a 19-year-old, studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says that his book last semester would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the board of the University, the average student spends more than $1 200 a year on books and apprenticeships, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, more than 250 campus books stores have doubled the lease of textbooks since 2011.
Statistical data on the sector reveal that around a quarter of the books of the university bookshops last spring had lease books, says Trevor Meyer, the President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus books.
This is the simplest way to save clear money.
Online trades
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for in the campus book shop.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book's ninth edition's recommended price is almost $290, but the special book online store Chegg.com book is charged at $239,99.
Buy as used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and lost appearances.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used for the Chegg.com online trade at $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25 years of student at Brigham Young University, says that he bought a book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using an Amazon.com online shop only at USD 0.42.
The new book would've paid for $48.
The Director of the Amherst's College of the University of Massachusetts without Walls, Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous printings can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old print can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for again.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstore, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to purchase used books.
Rent
You should consider renting the textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and you do not need them in your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the book "Calculus" for the whole semester is about $20.
Please refer to the rules of the leasing company, such as notes, the use of the pencil and the costs of the pencil, to the following charges.
Rent, be careful: If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book's purchase price.
E-books
Acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be questioned.
In some cases, these books are rented and paid for the right of use of the e-book to its holder, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
For six months, the Chegg store will receive the "Calculus" book as an e-book for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing the different sellers is worth the choice.
Joe Gault, 29, which begins soon in Pepperdine Laws, recommends using the ISBN book to determine the price because it can ensure that you are looking for a real book.
Before you order the network, make sure you're sure the book's in the warehouse, Gault says.
He's the one who learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was four weeks behind, and he eventually had to obtain a book at full cost at the university's book shop.
The Tampere Legion Theatre is 20 years old
The theater established in 1994 is opposed to unemployment, exclusion and passiveness.
The action is welcomed by everyone who wants to perform an art.
Organises expression-weighted hobby activities for long-term unemployed persons aged 17-35.
The presentations often take a view on society.
In recent years, there have been reports of narcissism and classical recommendations, such as depression, Moderata, Minaminamina!
He believes that every person can change his own life.
Almost double deaths in fire compared to last year
In this year, almost double deaths have been made in fires compared to last year.
According to the Finnish Central Rescue Organisation (Spek) media monitoring, 55 people have died in the fires by now in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, fire death was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the Fire Death Statistics, the last situation was in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died of fires.
Most fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the floor houses, 21 houses in private houses, and seven in rows and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of reproducing the home's fire safety.
At least all home fire extinguishers should work according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial decommissioning devices are easy to use.
There must also be an unacceptable exit route from all home premises.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of them gathered into a marshal against NATO in the city centre of Newport.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall, the so - called counter-huippukokous.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had arrived since Belgium.
The young people were rescued by airways from the blue mountains of Australia
Two teenage tourists were raised safely after they were stuck in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left to go to Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
The relatives were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o'clock.
A local police and assistant search patrol was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found about 23 p.m. near the Bridal Veil crashes.
The girl had broken her knees, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with the couple, and they were taken safely on Monday morning.
Patrols were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers retreat from Luhanski Airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhanski Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have worked hard together with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the military representative, the counterparty's firearm has been so precise that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
During the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Atomic Sea, a Ukrainian patrol ship sank in the south-eastern Ukraine last morning, reports the border guard.
Eight marine soldiers have been rescued and two still missing.
The Border Guard had no certainty where the ship was shot.
Separatists told me yesterday in social media that they shot the ship.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov requested that Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw from positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should create an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will respond to any new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions on the activities of our partners, and Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
On Sunday, the streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the harsh asses poured South Sweden and Denmark.
Flood waters cut off a number of roads, confused traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood could last, even though it was predicted that rain would cease by Monday.
The heavy rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and the rains were not given weather warnings in advance.
A specialist meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Air Science Institute estimates that the saddle of the region was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "speak and help France", Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Mr Valls strongly called on the split left side to "subject emotions" against the Socialist President with difficulties, whose composition of the new government did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," said Valls and earned the applause.
As a calm gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the French controversial 35 hours of work week despite the proposal that the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, had previously been debated this week, that the rule should be lamented.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused a divergent breakdown by exhibiting a meeting of socialists who gave different opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing France to give up hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Ultimate Justice National Front, mocked the continued interdepartment of socialists and said that the new government of Valls would not last for a few months.
Francois Hollande may have left to call the war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to set up a new government after the last one didn't last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," said Le Pen to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to break down the delegation and held sure that his party had a premature electoral victory, and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French dominant party suffered in the municipalities of the Murscape in March, and the extreme court held a list of importance in May's EU elections.
According to the opinion survey of the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, political researcher at the Po University, warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist Government succeeded in improving the economy and the high record unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pokka cheated on the morning of the Finnish leaders Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Podan's cheating badly in the recorded section of the program.
Morning in Finland last Thursday, the Finnish program published a fun video on his Facebook page on Thursday.
With the video, the conductors Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola as well as the meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning of the next day's broadcasting of Finnish advertising puffi, but the recording does not go very well.
Alm-Siira is confused when he tries to speak the word of the budget gap, and his confusing will also make Pouda and Rahkola lose his pants once and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to deliver a direct broadcast tomorrow, morning is stated in the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular in Facebook and is both liked and distributed in Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked at the photography office, was placed in the third series of potrets in 1972.
The picture contains Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A Socialist International meeting was held in the building masters' house in the Fredrik Street of Helsinki in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting, and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture in four five meters.
The light and the background were right.
I realized this time I succeeded.
From the face of the Meir, you see that the leaders of the Middle East have been having a hard time before.
At that time, the competition succeeded with pictures of known persons or events.
It is wonderful that other images can also succeed today, as long as there is an idea and a visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best thing about Lasse Virén's fall is the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Argument: Aarnio Survey already paid over EUR 5 million
Examination of the lawfulness of the activities of the Helsingin police's drug unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has required 30 to 50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki Jyväskylä was assessed in thesis of IT at the University.
Rajmäki submits that police law enforcement and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining information technology systems in the field of investigation and judicial processing.
According to the borders, current technology enables multiple use of criminal technical material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which data collected for the purpose of exploration is automatically electronic evidence that complies with the evidence chain and, at the same time, enables comprehensive legal oversight.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Top: The concept of vegetable food in 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Casvisdietan fish and chicken foods"
The picture of the special announcement of the women traveling to the school on the wall caused food in social media, reports Yle on their website.
Plant fooders!
The fish and chicken meals at the school lunch were planted.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable alternative!
That's what it says in the unforgettable 15-year-old news on the wall of the school.
You'll be able to take a picture from here.
The picture in the social media has led people to send Pirkkala’s disgusting feedback.
The head of the food and cleaning service Arja Vaarma notes to Yle that the unforgettable note on the wall is not true and should have been removed some time ago.
Obviously, before my arrival, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care at the time.
Every student receives a meal according to his wishes, he tells Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, only a vegetarian food option is offered by parents and by a doctor or nurse’s certificate of a vegetable meal.
The risk justifies the solution to Yle because young vegetable experiments may leave nutrient short and lack of meat or chicken can cause surprise from the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise near Prestige Cruise agreement worth $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, takes negotiations to buy its competitor at Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
As a result, the Norwegian Cruise company, whose market value is USD 6,8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruiseers of the Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers as it continues to compete more than the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations do not result.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises, a private equity investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations are not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates so much from Miami, sails with Oceania and Regent brand names, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was EUR 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
A cruise industry worth USD 29 billion is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies such as the average categories of China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing in order to get the first option of these new customers when they choose the cruise.
Prestige Cruises registers its first shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of its shares since 2007, with a value of $850 million.
In 2000, it was established with its current composition after it joined the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) Cruise. The latter is Lim Kok Thay’s Miljardööri, the entertaining and casino company of Malaysia.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the disclosure, Genting accounted for 28 % of the company, 20 % of Apollo and 8 % of TPG Capital LP's share of the private equity investment company from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise accounts for 82 % of North America's cruise capacity is reflected in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The Tampere City Government will discuss this today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will firmly support the initiative.
According to Salla, the director of the Animalia, who prepared a dissertation for the University of Tampere, the Court of Justice, should be quickly completed during the delfinaries in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, the view that the maintenance of developed mammals such as dolphins in dolphins in dolphins is not animal-protection or ethical.
This view would also be welcomed to Tampere.
The termination of the Delfinaario is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's illusion as a tourist destination, the Court of Justice points out.
According to the prosecution, the death of Visi-delfinin strengthens the requirements of the delfinarial activity.
I see death is a sad continuation of the dark history of Säränniemi delfinaario.
It is time to put a point on the deaths, close the prison of the dolphins, and start to figure out how to move the dolphins in Tampere to a restricted sea zone, a kind of dolphin safe home, the Court requires.
There was no time for this to return to the original habitat of delfins, but hopefully the rest of the delfins in Sparkannimen were able to experience more life than their uninspired concrete, the Court hopes.
The Animal Protection Union aims to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection law on preparations.
The dolphinarians are also included in this group.
In support of this requirement, the Director of Animalia will be involved in the 1 9th demonstration of the delfins today.
The spirit expression held by the Japanese embassy in Helsinki takes a position against the start-up period of delfin hunting in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 delfins are cruelly imprisoned or killed annually, either for the use of delfinaries or for food.
Putin demands that Kiev open negotiations on the new state with East Ukraine
On Sunday, President of Russia Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian Government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state of state" of the different region, the Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukraine region of the Separatists would be part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to allow the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend its own rights and interests.
The demand for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners to the Government of Putin Kiova, as well as the clear strategy he has followed since five years ago: he will seek to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government in practice to give the recently declared Novoross an autonomy that can lead to Russia instead of the West.
In the Interview of State Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to reintroduce the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region of the Separatists, which was taken by the separatists in March and April following the accession of Moscow to the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently postponed the day of the excellence of the Russian revolutions of the region as the "Novorossian", the "new Russia".
According to the Russian News Office Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "Lilsocia" for as long as Ukraine's politicians are taking campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and government troops are attacking civilians in the regions controlled by the separatists.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the South-East Ukraine State, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "nationality" is linked to a broader independence, which has been discussed with the leadership of Kiev for months in attempting to eliminate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the Eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, 'because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The interim remark of the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct Putin's 'misleading interpretation', stressed that the Russian regime deals with the revolving of the eastern separatists in different ways than in the case of Crimea, in practice taking over the area of the majority of the population of 2 million of the population of Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to join itself, even in Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6,5 million people living in the region are not ethnicly Russian, and according to the pre-conflict opinion surveys, the majority of the population were in favour of stay in Ukraine.
Independence on which the Russian diplomas have discussed at international forums would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would in practice give Kremlin power in a region that will combine Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet, as well as in the commercial port areas and historical coastal destinations.
In the Russian region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal alloys that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, proposed that Ukraine’s legislators – after new elections – consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making powers of regions other than the nuclear region of Ukraine from their own economy and their position of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to be dramatically different from the viewpoints of the Separatists, who may be armed and slumbered by Kremlin and Moscow.
Putinin submitted his latest demands to the Government of Kiev on negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels moved further last week after the invasion of Russian tanks and troops into East Ukraine earlier on the peaceful coast of Azov.
Ukraine's security authorities are afraid that taking over the Separatists supported by Russia, Novoazovski, is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategicly important coastal region until Crimea.
It has led to the strengthening of the city of Mariupol by massive civilians and military staff, known as the steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and the cape of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Saturday, asking for further action to prevent Russia's future offences in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll soon be able to reach a point without a return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional sanctions in order to allow them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine is re-established under uncertain circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the area of Ilovaisk, following the transfer of two Russian armed forces and 1 000 soldiers to the territory of Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told the journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers in Ilovaiski in Russia were replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.
In Milan's opening painting, the Japanese soldier Keisuke Honda made the seventh game minutes.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit, and a little later Jeremy Menez was hit by a punishment strike.
Laziok got the game at the end of his design, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shooting.
Lopez moved to Milan for this time from Real Madrid.
In the training debuty of the former attacker of Milan, the San Siro stadium was just halfway there.
The number of people reported the fight was 39,000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the naked scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been vaporized by hackers, perhaps stolen by his fiancée and naked images of the Hollywood A star Gabi Grecko.
Since Jennifer Lawrence's naked images were published on the Internet, the world has been flooded as a result of a wide range of celebrity search scandals.
Hakker has been reported to have a total of 60 naked pictures of the star of the hunger game from Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actor of Kirsten Dunst.
Also, the pictures of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The Edelsten, who asked Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, in New York, is reported with comments on the case in the web page as a "sacrifice" and said that the victims "feel themselves as dishonest."
Hakker's believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with this last boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on the upper pool.
Palmer's film records include a film "Love and Honor" counterplayer with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck series Strahovski and the Sucker Punch actress Browning didn't comment on the hacked pictures yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to the TMZ magazine, "it's a arrogant violation of privacy."
The artist Seth Roge was angry with the hacker in his tweet: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like his homefield and gained a sensational victory from Cuba in the MM races of the balloon.
Look at the pictures of the fan drug.
The Polish Katowice was white on Monday, not Polish red-white, but Finnish blue-white.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish collectors in the Spodekareen.
