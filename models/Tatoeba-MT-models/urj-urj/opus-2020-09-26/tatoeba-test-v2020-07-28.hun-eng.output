I appreciate what Tom did for me.
Tomi's glad he's finished.
Why are you climbing up to that tree?
He led me to the palace.
There's a woman who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up, and he did it.
That's the bull.
We respect them very much.

Are you deliberately trying to confuse me?
I volunteered.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You'll need an alibi.

You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There are two old gesture trees in front of our house.
They were screaming.
The snowflakes fell on long blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in the picture.
I hope we don't make you uncomfortable.
Let's discuss this outside.

Shall we have something to drink?
He's holding his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard for everyone to be in the mood.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom's making?
There's no such thing.

He laughed to cover his fear.
I'm on the line.

Tom won't hurt me.
It's a green shop.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel helpless.
Goodbye.

I'm glad we agree on something.
And then the bear ran to the farmer, threw off his bear's skin and touched him with the magic wizard that the witch gave him. In a moment, the skin became a beautiful moonlighted prom dress, and the talicska turned into a stallion that two dancers pulled.

For most people, it's very disturbing for you to speak in public.
Shoot!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
We're going to the classroom.
Tom's busy.
There are people that can easily be influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which way are you going?

It's cold.

Got it?
I'll see you.
That'll be interesting.

Last day was hot, but today it was lighter.
We have to warn Tom.

Have you had Petanque yet?
There's a great sock, too.
I didn't figure it out.
I can't follow your logic.
What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the targeting.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you were gonna get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to go to bed.
I don't believe a word of it.
My birthday is November.
Did you guys behave well today?
You're stupid!

Here's your beer.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you buy this bike?

I hope it works.
I'm here to bring my dog.

You're poor.
Push yourself.

Coffee's ready.
You only love me because of my black hair?
I'm sure I heard that voice somewhere.
The doctor asked him to go to the hospital.
I'll have breakfast.
I'm not well paid.

I hope they're fine.

Keep doing what you did.
Eat some.
We'll take care of it later.
I'm Israeli.
They've entered the woods.
How could you wait for me to pay for this?
Tom asked Mary where he lived.
If it hadn't been the map, I would have lost it.
I think he's coming.
It's tomorrow night.
Tamás left-handed?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife left me.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What are you looking at?
It's unlikely that Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.
Tom's in the pajamas.
I've been waiting for you.
Tom's greedy.
No one lives in this house.
As far as English is concerned, no one can rest.
Sponge to him!
You're not gonna die.
Has Tomi been fired?
My horse is white.
You got me.
We have to be serious.
Is the museum open today?
Tom's not because he's on the edge of the cliff.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'll wash it again.
You learn English every day?
Good luck with the races.

Looks like it.

Nobody sees my tears.
She was born in Mohammed Meka.
Tom and Mary's twins.
Describe the words you don't understand.
Who's the smartest man you know?
I want things to be okay tomorrow, at this time.
The end of the hot summer days and replaced them in the cool winter days.
Why me?
I've never thought about that before.
No one's seen.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
My son came to my room.
Tomi doesn't seem happy to see us.
After Tomi died, his wife remarried.
Tom's an ace ace.
I didn't do what I should have done.
Does Tom have a tattoo?
I'm not going to apologize.
Please stay where you are.
I'm not traveling much.
He stayed in France for a while, and then went to Italy.
He's always busy.
There's a certain probability that my life will cost it.

Did you find anything?
Keep this thing away from me.
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
It's possible to expand the dress.
He's gonna shower 10 times a day.
It's very white.
They left last night.
We've never had a concert in Boston.
Maybe Tom doesn't know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good-looking people look good, no matter what they wear.
You're like an alma with a candle.
Tom's desk now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand that noise.
It's really nice to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tomi's rich, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.
I like coffee.
Do you know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy it for you.
We're reasonable.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Give us a presentation.
The world is a problem.
Tom's losing.
They're playing baseball after school.
They laughed at me.
You've done the perfect job.
He jumped into the fountain.
Tomi wants to buy some books.
Here's the sun.
What will they do?
Tom led the attack.
Tom's almost never eating cucumbers.
No, this isn't my house.
I live in New York.
We're out of coffee.
Let's have a beer.
What would you do if it was your child like this?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This never ends.
They both laugh.
I wish you didn't do that right now.
I tried to help Tomi.
Your soul is ruined to hell.
I have a fever and a headache, and I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm getting in.
Take this off.
He won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come touch him.
Tom asked Mary the same thing he asked me.
The moon belongs to no one.
We were born to this world for a reason.
I helped Tomi decorate his Christmas tree.
I forgot to buy flowers to Eva.
We didn't do it for Tomi.
He could have kissed me goodbye, but he didn't, he just walked away.
We're not that poor.
He's working for the pay and not because he's enjoying it.
I know who's hurt.
I'm independent.
By night, the shadow of the tree reached the wall.
He's a good friend.
He made a serious scientific discovery.
On Tom's computer, the secret file stores hundreds of gigabytes of hermelin videos.
Why are you so tired today?
My appetite's gone.
How many people do you think we should invite to the party?
Tomi doesn't have many books.
I have doubts about whether it's gonna work.
Let's wash it.
He doesn't like sports, like I don't.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What am I supposed to do with Tomi?
I feel better every day.
I feel a fever.
What do doctors say?
I forgot your last name.
Please help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you apologizing?
Tom's afraid they're being deceived.
Did you know Tom left home?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tomi dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.
Tom dumped his girlfriend's photos in the fire.
I'll go and tell everyone.
Step forward.
You're hypocrites.
It reminds me of a girl I've ever known.
I was on the list.
Give me my book back!
Although we've done everything we can, we know we won't win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.
Tom didn't know his water heater was a hole until he got a huge water bill.
This is our secret.
Why are you worried?
I'm sorry, but I didn't understand exactly what you said.
Last night, there was a fire near us.
We better go, Tom.
Probably all of you could use some sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds surrounded the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
He's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same stuff again today.
I assume Tamás was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Thomas to help.
Tom's out there.
One of my bike wheels is defective.
I don't often have lunch with Tamu.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I'm gonna keep it hot.
That sentence hasn't been translated yet.
Tom expects too much.
It's very depressed.
Man's not from the monkey, except some.
It's okay with us.
Tom wants to learn how to surf.
I have a tough day today.
Here's your bag!
Intelligent man is who discovered something more interesting than sex.
Tom wears a squirrel costume.
He loved both of them, and they both loved him.
I can't stop laughing at it.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said.
Cut off your hair.
Tamás drinks bottled water.
Personally, I find sucking more enjoyable than traditional sex.
This is incredible.
After a short wait, he started carrying stupid things together.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
That's a crime.
Tom's gonna cook.
Do you have an e-mail address?
You were hanging, you weren't ready.
The Tomi knew where Mary put her car.
You should get some sleep.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
Look.
Don't store your bike in the barn.
Sometimes I go to the movies.
Tamás never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna throw Tom out.
Tom pulled a $20 out of his pocket.
I didn't want to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom should have gone home early.
The prices are going up.
Clear the garbage.
I didn't buy the car.
How much does the bus ticket cost?
He's not doing anything!
Hard French accent?
I see a house.
Just so you know, this is a really bad joke.
He's playing poker with us.
Did you like the show?
The dishes baked in the fat are very delicious.

It's up to them now.
Take us to the city.
He spent three months on the pound.
Tom's stuck.
Just because he started reading the book when someone knocked at the door.
I was just off to work when the phone ringed.
I feel uncomfortable.
Induction stoves use magnets to heat the dishes and pans directly.
Thank you for being me.
They have everything they need.
He's always on my side.
No one likes a horseman.
He's comfortable.
It's all right, it's over.
The police arrested the burglar.
I like things like that.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I've decided.
You shouldn't wait long.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying!
Tom put the boxes on each other next to the wall.
It's known that the bear loves honey.
We're winning.
Don't bother getting up.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?
I fell asleep, I'm late for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
Kittens are going to have mouses.
He parked his car on an empty tent.
This is his Christmas present.
You know that?
It's never too late to study.
Take a look at the Google Translator.
You're my princess.
What a wonderful place!
I wish we could do something for Tom.
I'll keep that in mind.
It was a big house.
We're happy to accept your offer.
I went on foot.
It wasn't Tom.
How about we go home tonight to dinner?
Dreams have come true.
Don't cry.
Tom told me he was home last night.
I didn't tell anyone you were here.
That's very good news.
Does that even matter?

That's just what happens in Australia.
Turkey is a grinding language.
I wanted to know the truth.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Tom's breathing.
Please fix this.
Tom lost his legs because of a shark attack.
Can I ask you a question?
Guess what I found.
I'm sick of sea.
Great chicks have grown in Florida.
Tom's too young for that, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't take the wedding ring off my finger.
I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
He was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do you speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep listening.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, like you are.
I'm counting on you to join us.
You woke me up.
I'm looking for my phone.
He's shaking.
No one can stop me anymore.
Who did you see?
I'm gonna sleep here.
Tom pulled Mary out of the house.
Mari was injured when Tomi bought her some breath refreshers.

I like to follow the tradition at night to take a walk next to the lake.
What can we expect?
I have a thumb in my finger.
Animals are afraid of fire.

Don't go to college just because that's what they're expecting from you.
The box is almost empty.
That's what's gonna happen.
We shouldn't have done that.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
I need a translator.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
Attention, please.
I'm ready to help you anytime.
We'll figure it out.
The batteries are exhausted.
He's got a good seat for me.
Sooner or later, we'll all die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you bagged yet?
Tom's on the job.
Tomi couldn't hide his frustration.
We tried to warn you.
I found their volaps very complicated, unlike the esperant, which is very simple.
You'd better be careful.
Tom loves kids.
It's a wash today.
This is so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
It's full of floor glass chips.
These bananas are not mature.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
But I don't have any iron.
I think you were right.
Where did they keep the wedding?
I'm swimming in the river.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
The water's cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel stupid.
It's a good place to hide.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Have fun all night, storming in the morning.
When are you taking the elections?
Tom's a supporter.
Tom walked in.
I was sitting on a chair in Bern at the patent office when I suddenly had an idea: if a man falls free, he doesn't feel his own weight.
Speak louder so everyone can hear you.
A new train-inducing system is installed on the railline.
We believe in God.
They forgot about you.
Where do we eat tonight?
He's dressed like a man's suit.
We should have bought three bottles of wine.
Can I borrow it?
I can't find Time.
Stand straight.
Thania's job is temporary.
I hope it's good.
That's not interesting.
You've always been like this.
The sun drowned under the horizon and darkened.
Which party won?
Tom's home.
Tom cut off a piece of meat and put it on his plate.
I'll try again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If everything goes well, he's graduated in 2001.
The decision has been decided.
This has never happened to me.
Dani has three thousand flight hours.
He wiped his face with a handkerchief.
I don't understand what's so funny about this.
I'll surprise Tomi.

What did you and Tom eat?
It's a terrible news.
This multimillion-million guy has five homes in four countries.
That's the best.
He's not here right now.
Don't be so stupid.
He took her home.
I don't wish anyone's death.
He said he didn't know anything about it.
Can I go get some ice cream?
Did they hurt you?
I'll let Tomi know.
I should have been more precise.
And how do you know that?
I want to see you.
Tom's a scientist.
Is Sicily very close to Malta?
Tom's too old for me.
Being black is not a sin.
I grew up, but my fear of darkness never passed away.
The ice is melting.
There were Tamás and Mary.
It's fair to have the same pay for the same job.
After the case, our relationship has suddenly changed.
I cried over the night.
Tom says he never liked Chinese food.
Tamás works in a pasta factory.
Jim was caught cheating on the exam.
What's wrong with your dog?
Tom was at home all weekend.
I think I should have helped Tom.
We won't let Tomi do that.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
Looks like I don't have to be here.
I'd love to eat something.
Thank you for not saying, "I told you."
Everything's back to normal wheel cuts.
How did you think of such a good excuse?
You cheated!
I have to leave early.
The decision hasn't been made yet.
I sold it this afternoon.

He was wounded during an intruder stealing.
Are we all ready?

I just want to do something fun.
There's another man in his life.
Do you speak Chinese well?
I'll be there tonight.
When we returned, there were only eight team members.
What do you mean, UFO?
I lived there for five years.
I'll give this to Tom.
I just need you.
Why should we be interested in this?
Is there any doubts?
Swimming was my favorite sport in high school.
The English respect the freedom.
He really speaks well.
I know Tom's happy.
Let us not forget the main purpose of the meeting.
Don't scratch your forehead.
Canada's first hymn was written in French.
Leave the dog outside.
I'm rubbing around a lot.
Who's the man?
The robots must add you to the world.
We need to find a way to stop Tom.
No one's taking me anywhere.
The sign says, "Do not smoke."
I saw Tamás today.
What a strange country!
Your friends are waiting for you.
Of course.
When he came out of the shower, it was just a towel.
These pictures remind us of bad memories.
Are you happy?
What the hell is wrong with you people?
I'll text you later.
It's hard to learn German in my country.
I knew it was us.
Orange is bigger than mandarin.
Tom took a white box.
Tom was wearing a black coat.
You should come back anytime you want.
I'm a little tired of myself.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.

Please interpret my strange dreams.
I'm gonna be late.
I did it without you.
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.
I really like urban life.
Tom cares about his own business.
It's not good to look down on anyone else.
It's the same for everyone.
I'm not ugly.
Some people have mocked my situation.
You forgot our wedding anniversary.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
Fix the watch.
We're looking for Olaja.
One more time.
Be careful, it could be a trap.
I can't take so long away from my wife.
There is still no clear definition of what the country means.
It's a big world.
"What happened?" "The car broke."
Don't spend money you haven't even earned.
It's a little early for the drink, isn't it?
They're all yelling.
How much is the beer?
They blamed György for failure.
He lifted his hand.
He always laughs and fun.
You, me and him there, Joseph, we make a team.
He told me he'd be leaving soon.
My mom lived with us.
People don't like what they don't understand.
You're a very special person to me.
He finished the letter.
I'm Ricardo.
Where are we going?
The newspaper says he's committed suicide.
Hurry up or we're late.
Are they selling portable personal computers in this business?
You had lunch?
Where is love?

I have twins.
What the hell?
Tom's probably not gonna be here tomorrow.
Tom has to go to school.
My neck hurts a little.
I won't let Tom go to Boston.
They've been sailoring the Earth.
The goods are coming at sea.
No one can stop him.
I know who he is.
I should have denied that.
Tom's gonna be really angry.
Why are you doing this now?
Shut up and do what they say to you.
What a great performance!
I can't drive.
Tomi wanted everyone a happy Christmas.
Get off the corrupt politicians!
Tomi quit the company in 2013.
Tom and Mary were both home.
She's afraid of this dog.
I want to buy a dozen donuts.
He sent me a contract.
He's jealous.
Tom doesn't have much time to relax.
Tom wants to try.
Tell me where you were last night at the time of the murder.
Stop while you can.
Ten, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve.
We're half an hour after midnight.
You have an hour.
I've risen above my fears.
Why did you buy this bike?
Stay still seated, please.
It's a black horse.
Do you have enough money?
Let's start the weekend.
The teacher kept him in after school.

He sent you a book.
I have an old bike.
I have to run.
Have a nice vacation.
Tomi didn't want to go golf.
It's a small chance that I can get to the meeting.
They weren't there.
Tom did a good job.
I'm kind of tired.
I don't remember ever getting tired of the job, although nothing is going to get me completely exhausted.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom and Mary's work.
This is the new model.
Except for Tom, no one left.
I didn't die.
Do you know who said that?
We're exhausted.
He wants you dead.
I'm demanding a financial refund.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of the seemingly hopeless situations.
He's heart disease.
Are you all right?
I think he's my best bartender.
Give me a day.
Lucky today is on my side.
Please tell me your name.
Do you think Tom did it?
I don't want to go with you.
Which one's your cable?

You haven't been washed your hands yet, have you?
You still want me?
We can't wait two weeks.
We'll come and see you.
I named my daughter Nairu and wished her a long life.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?
Tom never asked why.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
By the weather like this, it's best if we stay home and we're not going anywhere.
He's weighing 50 pounds.
Tomi tried to hide his frustration.
I can't believe Tomi could do this all by himself.

I missed her from school because of her illness.
Those roses aren't as nice as these.
He chose a red car.
Use your own money.
No one knows their names.
Let's make sure you don't.
You're exhausted.
Who was watching?
I didn't steal it, I just borrowed it.
I'm sure Tom's found guilty.
Where are you, Karen?
You're saying it's my fault?
Tom should have done that by now.

That's what we agreed on.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
That's not a good idea.
