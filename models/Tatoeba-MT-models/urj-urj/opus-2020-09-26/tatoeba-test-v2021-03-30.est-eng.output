Take a few days off.
I don't have hobbies, except football.
I just finished dinner.
I'm here.
We all want to come with you.

Tom's alone in his car.
How long do I have to be here?

We believe it's time to smile more often.
I trust what Tom said.
I saw them kiss.
Where's my blue lucky dog?
He was standing by the road.
My love pays nothing.

Water is liquid.
This thing isn't alive.
What were you thinking?
He wants to be a singer.
Whatever.
We think it's time to smile more.
Tom made it pretty clear.
Tom's dangerous, isn't he?
I'll drink the tea.
The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.
They're my friends.
Looks like Tom's sleepy.
You're not targeting high enough.
You should, by the way, find out what she feels and thinks.
I'm talking a lot.
Why didn't you eat your chocolate?
The doctor used an X-ray for my stomach.
Sitting in the office with this weather is a real punishment.

What are you doing now?
What's the problem?
I'm sorry...

I have to go now.
Tom didn't come home.
That's a tough question.

You'll pay for that.
Why are you acting like a child?
How was the ride?
It's not the same thing anymore.

Do you remember who I am?
I'd like to be with you.
Are you crazy?
You can take it with you.
Wait a minute.
Tom slept in his bed.
I want some tea.
How is that even possible?
Where do you use it?
No one noticed me.
I'll wait for you.
Who believes that?
Just bet you talk to Tom.
How are you all doing?
We can do this later.
Looks like no one paid attention to what he said.
He wrote a letter.
I'm happy to be with you.

Tom was expecting something different.
I recognized him right away.
Can I talk to you alone?
Life is never easy.
You're pathetic.
I speak Chinese, but I can't read it.
Why would Tom want to do something like that?

The flower is red.
He almost drowned in the river.
Death-proof!
Tom's not a very good driver.
It would have been better if you hadn't come today.
His proposal is not very important.
Cheque, please.
No way!
He was wrong to think he came to see him.
My wife is pregnant.
I'll write a letter.
Stop, please.
Hold it!
I became his friend.
Tom was obviously disappointed.
I'll wash this shirt.
Isn't I beautiful?

It's not worth it!
Tom's longer than me.
I go swimming once a week.
I still have a lot to learn.
I know what this is about.
I only drove to Boston to make Tom a birthday present.
Everyone stays calm.
Their wedding is tomorrow.
It's a recognized American writer.
I'll give you a good advice.
I'd like to try.
There's a message for you.
I'm not always home on Sundays.
Maybe next time you listen, if I ask you to be careful.
I'm sorry, it's not your call.
I bought it for my girl.
Is your mother home?
The investigation's on.
I like the proun.
Whatever!
Tom's barely alive.
I would never do that to Tom.

Haven't I suffered enough yet?
It's the truth of life.
Eat while he's hot.
I have to wear boots.
As I understand, you were the last person to see Tom.
Here's the address.
It was really very unfair about Tom.
Tom respects your opinion.
We have what we deserve.
I slept at 10:00 last night.
We should talk about this.
Are you going to buy a vocabulary?
Here's what you asked.
This house is too small.
I have nothing to do with this.
The box was full of strawberries.
Yeah.
I'm an American singer.
Let's rest.
Are you stupid?
One language is never enough.
I was young, and I needed money.
He put all his jewels in a small red box.
What's your favorite dessert with strawberries?
He pushed the hat on his back.
I can't believe I said that!

I just wanted to know if you were in trouble.
Where are the books?
Everybody looks tired.
It's a normal attitude here.
I'd like to borrow about three hundred thousand dollars.
Who are you?
He turned on.
Turns out it's not a crime.
Looks like we're running out of money.
The book is on the table.

This is my third week.
Golden money was much more valuable than it expected.
Italian is my native language.
I didn't have to move it.
Excellent!

No one's gonna know.
There's something good in here.
We know that now.
I'd better call Tom again.
Do you have a vocabulary?
When's Tom coming?
Did you feel the earthquake last night?
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
Things don't always go the way we plan.
What are you doing here?
Please bathe the kids.

You should tell me what you're thinking.
Take it easy.
All the doors are locked in the house.

Tom heard about our conversation.
This is my e-mail address.
She's a beautiful woman.
Tom didn't understand why Mary had made such a decision.
It's not the only thing I have to do.

Obviously.
How do you and Tom get along?
I didn't have much choice.
How'd you guess that?
Did you have to share the bedroom with your sisters and sisters?
You're very good-bye.

Hang on!
I have a big request.
Are you ready to go?
This has happened before.
I'm very shy.
