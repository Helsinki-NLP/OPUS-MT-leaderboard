European inflation has slipped on food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The increase in prices in November in 13 euro zones was higher than expected, after 2.6% in October, the Union's statistical office in Luxembourg reported an annual inflation of 3.1%.
The official forecast was only 3 percent probable - announced by Bloomberg.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Central Bank (ECB), the United States, the British and the Canadian central banks, did not cut the basic coupon, saying that the reduction would lead to the development of inflation spirals, along with the rise in raw materials prices and the reduction in unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in the twenty-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-
In Germany, the value of November inflation is 3.3 per cent as a 12-year record, and in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 in Spain.
Eurozone inflation has been cut to high trends in food and energy prices.
The fixed wheat notes increased by 88 per cent and the soya bean price has reached the highest value since 1973.
Significantly more paid for diet oil and milk products was also required in 2007.
The world market price of oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is jumping from 2.1 to 2.5% in 2008, but in 2009 it is now dropping to 1.9%.
Indicators show that the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease interest twice during 2008.
The government crisis is seen by the Gallup
After the long-term stagnation of Fides' supporters, it has increased significantly since the beginning of December, and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured so low socialist support for 13 percent.
In the case of Commissioners, the difference - because of the greater determination of opposition voters - would be more than two-thirds (71%) of support against the one-thirds (20%) of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SDO are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the voters in the Commissioner, the supporters of both camps are one percent.
The economic consensus was further deteriorated in the previous depth - it has never been so high, 41 percent of the proportion of the country's economic situation was explicitly very bad, while the situation was rather bad in 46 percent.
Family changes in their financial situation after spring and summer hopeful prospects are now reappeared to pessimisticity.
For the next year, half of the population are further deterioration and only a decade of improvement.
In December, more than 71 percent of the previous Gallup surveys considered that the Prime Minister was rather ill than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
54 percent of the head of government don't trust him at all, 27 percent of the President of Fides.
One of the indicators in the political situation is how much society thinks it can be treated with the Prime Minister without change of government.
While 35 percent of the government and the head of government were desirable after the disturbances in October last year, this ratio is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in the formulation of the new elections.
The interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of the asked respond to the question of participation is sure to leave, and another 20 percent say that he would probably leave.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would be involved in a "modern parliamentary election" that is to be held on Sunday, and a further 15 percent would be considered likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
For tuition, 74 people, 79 and 84 percent of the hospital's daily award would say no.
If we look at the same rates only in the referendum among the promising parties, 81, 84 and 89% of the voters would take the introduction of tuition fees, water fees and daily hospital fees.
The most expensive Auchan was raised by Tesco by nearly five.
The hypermarkets maintained a trade triangle of price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that the VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Day Economy
In this year, the average trade triangle of Budaörsi grew by 16 per cent, the usual Christmas basket of the Day, but in each hypermarket there was a significant increase of over 1,000 forints.
Since the prices of food stores have already been "departured" in December last year, there has been no drastic cost increases in the previous high base.
However, it is apparent that consumers are terrifying that what they could have received in the last year under nine thousand HUF will not be able to reach it for even ten thousand.
The Day basket crossed the ten thousand forints of soulological boundaries at the test hypermarkets at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was for HUF 10 573.
(The basket cost 6800 HUF in 2003.)
The price of Unicum and the living fish remained almost on the level of last year, but the turkey mellfile, the nuts and sows, were very expensive.
The KSH data were followed by the prices of flour and bread in stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not press the product price under HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this business that the two-lit Coca-Cola price was below for 200 forints, so only 257 forints were requested with the deposit fee.
With this together, however, this year the Auchan showed the most expensive in the sun basket, while the Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, the prices of the last year's Christmas prices were raised by Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by around 18-18 percent in the Sun basket.
Compared to the most expensive and cheapest cart value this year, the difference was 12 percent, while the lowest and most expensive this year’s growth was 21 percent.
Forint had an average increase of 1480.
Last year, the average price increase to HUF 1206 came out by feeling the effect of the price increase in VAT last Christmas.
This process has broken down trade, apparently it has not been possible for the stores to decide how much price is applied to a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a product's rotation rate is wrongly designed by the trader, it will have a major impact on the price adjusted for traffic intensity.)
The price increase in the Sun basket has been so extremely high for VAT last year, that the expensiveest amount of HUF 1720 was more than the 2006 value, while the price difference was only 844 forints.
This extremity was not shown this year, since the most expensive forts of this year were more than last year, and the cheapest fort was 1284 forints.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and over 30 percent of the daily consumer products in hypermarkets were expensive over the period of less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not necessarily justify KSH's data: the price increase of some basic foods by more than 30% over 12 months was measured by the Statistical Office.
For example, beside flour at eggs.)
According to the Sun basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter, as the price level of the product has already been quite expensive in the last year compared to the base was at least 10 percent higher in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the eggs, the drastic price increases have been tricked by multitudes.
In the gold triangle of trade, hypersensitivity is not complaining, they keep reporting a good year.
We have experience in the three shops visited the customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a quantity from everything, they take the permanent food platinum.
Wednesday morning, both three stores developed serious lines before the money prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic in the countryside is growing, and there are many complaints to research firms that even its plans are missing revenues, not only for food, but also for long-term consumer products.
In many places they save in disinfectants
In this year, more than 1,000 infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the seizure of beds, the overload of staff do not favour stopping infections, says the Head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
There are many places to save disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection has been diagnosed at the traumatology department at the John's Hospital.
In a man in a serious accident, bacteria resistant to antibiotics were shown.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon later, it had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery had not been completed since because of the bacteria in his body.
By December 10, this year a hospital infection caused by a multiresistant pathogen was reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said the Head of the National Epidemiological Centre, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that such infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen have definitely been registered in hospitals, and the others have not been known.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by one third of humans without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, inflammation of the antidepressants, inflammation of the skin, inflammation of the skin, inflammation of the wound) respond well to antibiotics.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess or inadequately, the antibiotics are highly resistant to antibiotics, which are rapidly spreading under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is transient or persistent, it may cause severe hospital infections in patients with weakened body, age or low body weight, such as surgical infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the Director-General of the John’s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the patrol, MRSA is not there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resists to antibiotics
"We separate these patients, the nurses carry the patient in rubber gloves and masks and have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be evaluated for the presence of MRSA in their body, but therefore the infection cannot always be avoided.
Non-fashion sampling
The majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but current hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to prevent the development and spread of multi-resistant diseases, says Börcz Karolina.
After this infection occurs typically in hospitals, hospitals should check the intake patients, and patients carrying MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most of the cases thus become known if the patient becomes an MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are home directives to cure individual infections and diseases.
It should be sought to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out so as not to develop resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals should not in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in congenital or basic supply, reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly spreading from one patient to the other through the mediation of health care personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, gloves, mask use plays a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with drop-infection, contact, however, under domestic hospital conditions, the infected patient is not always able to be separated.
In fact, the hospitals are often crowded, and beds are often very close to each other, when it is epidemic, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, it is also experienced, noted by Böröcz Karolina that in the unfavourable material hospitals they save in disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is evidence that such infection is less likely to be stopped or the spread of the pathogen can be further stopped.
Governance programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is a huge cost to health insurance companies, and they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
It appears that the programme is successful, based on the data reported, the MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include the development of multi-resistant diseases (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such diseases.
He wasn't drunk by the police officer responsible for the death accident.
The official expert opinion was prepared on the death accident caused by the XXII police officer.
It is not possible that the XXII district police captain, who had killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, had been informed by Morvai Attila, the spokesperson of the General Public Prosecutor's office on Friday after the expert opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the primary finding of the investigation, which has already established that the former police officer did not consume alcohol before sitting behind the volatile.
The former head of the XXII district was hit by a 55-year-old man who did not want to get to the other side of the road on Tuesday, in the Kossuth Lajos district of XXII.
(The latter, so that the pedestrian did not pass through the zebra, is not otherwise a relieving condition under the rules of the KRESZ, the retarding car man must give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after he was transported to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police officer retired from his post and asked for his rest, according to the police, because the case was so upset.
In the case, the Budapest D.A.S.A. is conducting an inquiry.
Morvai Attila also found out that the former police officer was co-operating with the prosecutors from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three Euros, totalling EUR 400 million, signed a loan framework agreement with the Vice-President of Education, Transport and Environmental Infrastructure and Energy, Mr Veres and Mr Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million in 2006 for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects from cohesion fund support, with a loan agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties, with the remaining €200 million.
The loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also intended to finance projects related to education.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, using the remaining EUR 150 million later by extending the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, a contract of EUR 50 million has been signed by the parties, which is used primarily for the Debrecen University research-development project.
The meeting also discussed the metro four.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the subway financing with the EU, they will return to see whether and how to change the original contract.
According to John Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate of loans shall be provided by the EIB with a 8-year period of recession and without the availability of the reserve.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise in the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed to the poorly mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying the EU's still cheapest but fast-driven market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The best destination for buying real estate in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains, the most decent regions of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and Albena, the Arany Beach, the Napospart, the ancient Sosopol and Nesebra, but more and more are searching for property in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will sooner or later raise the interest of investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more are also purchased in the vicinity of the explicitly cheap Russ.
The capital, Sofia also attracts attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so next to the summer and winter season, the other two seasons will be a priority destination.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying large amounts, such as in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, in Bulgaria, those who buy real estate are also seeking to change their lifestyle.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and Russian customers are traditionally many in the Black Sea and ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents or renovated properties are purchased at a price of between €50 and €100 000 or old houses of €5.15 thousand and then renovated.
There are good accessibility and communication opportunities, important for them by a major city, shops, and usually a local doctor's proximity.
The second category is for the holiday customers (Bulgaria was placed on the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is formed by business investors who are buying in the hope of medium to long-term increase in value.
The price of capital real estates is continuing, as demand is growing.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but the last five years have risen by 21 per cent.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially higher than the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister for the Environment and Water, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday after the official opening, the international climate regime after 2012 will continue to negotiate with ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries worldwide are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period designated by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently a strong debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it is not currently willing to negotiate precise numbers, although it is urged to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will also undertake to provide financial and technological assistance to the countries that need it, along with reducing emissions.
A agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by 16 boards of directors, is expected to be read in the Market and Profit in the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF).
Six percent of Hungary
Mr Gábor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain the role of a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will take 20 percent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, irrespective of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 Convention and will take up to 30 percent reductions, if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to undertake their responsibilities and capabilities.
Mr Gábor pointed out that, in 1997, the total number of countries joining the Kyoto Protocol was reducing by 5.2%, including the EU - that is 15 Member States - accounted for 8%.
Hungary's obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. - reminds the Ministry of Environment's press release.
Balin is a high bet, because in two years, the long-term international climate agreement should be brought under the roof, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be post-2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system, which is necessary in the latest report of the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Award, the international scientific body on climate change.
This would have delayed emissions reductions and become inevitable for the increase in Earth’s average temperature above 2 degrees of celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
YouTube recruits the British army
Records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will be published on the video squadron by the British army units that promote themselves.
Firstly, the British Air Force (RAF) has received youTube: since March 2006, the Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos on their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These miniature tapes with helmet cameras are inspected at the Command of Air Force Corps, and then sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the domestics.
Political message is inevitable
Air force soldiers have already recorded 139 videos on the Internet in this form, and their channels have been watched for over 75 grand.
The British Ministry of Defenceheadquarters is registered in spring 2007, and both Iraq and Afghanistan are publishing videos, while the United Nations Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The original purpose of the air force was to recruit the videos, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also a good thing to learn with the general public the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment ads - said the BBC’s defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - but also has some political message in an unforeseen way, as it demonstrates the existence of military action decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army also has a problem with the amateur videos that, in addition to carefully edited, censored videos, will be placed on the dealer, such as the death of soldiers: in a little hypothetical, official propaganda films, the officers speak maximumly about losses, but do not present the bloody side of the battle.
In other words, many videos from the Iraqi and Afghan warfield have already been added to the Internet, which has been made in sharp deployments, but the British army has just recently received it.
The Americans recruit a little differently, the free downloadable American's Army with a shooting game in which the player can hide directly into the skin of the soldiers under a more or less lifelong simulation.
Tomatoes and pog-care Christmas will be at the Ministry
Lamperth Mónika Minister for Labour does not seem emotional: instead of the Christmas party, he will have an annual workshop for his colleagues who can thank them for the heat and coffee since 2007.
There's a department where there's a live music party, and there's a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials with snacks and cocktails somewhere else.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and Swedish table - so have fun in power.
The public offices are ready for Christmas.
The most customary Ministry Christmas party is held by the national wallet this year, but the HM is not waiting for the Ministry staff.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, and at the Mission Christmas, they are visiting the family members of the current soldiers in foreign missions, but they are also organising a press reception.
The wallet is 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will be released from the wallet compared to the other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the future House, with a total of HUF 4 320 000, and a total of 300 50 guests are expected from the 60 ministerial employees.
At the wallet's ceremony, they're gonna stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but they're gonna be performing and performing.
The NFÜ Christmas cost $4 700 000, and the National Justice Council (OIT) also held concerts and dinners on Wednesday.
The survey cost a million forints, and the remaining part was spent on more than four hundred invited.
We believe that one of the NFU's departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is managed by an offer management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU funds.
For the purpose, the building of the Water Theatre was hired.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt, because we failed to reach the competent.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building also saw not only the NFU, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held a Luca Day bál on December 7, instead of Christmas.
They didn't ask for money for the use of OIT's halls.
There were 500 people at the prom.
The party started with the minister's toast and danced live after dinner.
The [origo] question was reported: the prom was not obligatory for the evening dress or the suit at all.
Puritan is set up for a party with health, employment and municipality wallets.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and a celebration for employees for HUF 400 000 in its own building.
However, the Minister of Labour of Lamperth Mónika is not officially waiting for the Christmas party, but for his colleagues at the end of the year.
They're expecting 100 guests, who - told the press department - only get coffee and pogs, so they can get the party out of $350,000.
The Prime Minister of Municipality of Bajnai Gordon will simply coccinine with his colleagues in the AuI of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organise a Christmas meeting in its own hall, for which 436 employees will be expected.
Each guest has $2500 for the Christmas party - the amount of a Swedish bet and a cocktail.
Ever since János Veres is the Minister, every year the PM employees are similarly Christmased.
But Bulihangulat will not be, but formality will not only be confirmed by the Ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The farming wallet will receive a new year's bet on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas will be over.
The bet is held in the Vajdahunyadvár, the City League, and according to the wallet, they spend 1000 HUF per head for a hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple stand-alone apprenticeship that is only officially accredited by foreign diplomats to Hungary.
These bets every year start with a short ministerial welcome and end up with a retarded detour.
At all, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not have a Christmas party with [origo] in the competent press departments.
They couldn't tell me the price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet at the press department.
Every time, more than 400 people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Industrial Arts.
The forces of the giant strategies are gathering.
On Friday, their strike co-ordinated on Monday, undecided strike will be formed by the League Professional Organisations and the National Association of Labour Councils.
On Saturday, there is a protesting assembly, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - it begins.
The action will certainly lead to a significant threat in transport, as rail transport will almost stop and strike for 13 hours at BKV.
On Friday afternoon, the League Professional Organisations will describe the details of the Monday strike that was jointly organized with the National Association of Work Boards.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate the activities of Monday.
They will hold a controversial meeting on Saturday, and from Monday to Monday, the organisations joining the strike will end the work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of termination of the strike started was not marked - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
However, if the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the legislation is voted, the strike committees will come together and decide on the follow-up.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted in late evenings, perhaps nighttimes.
As a result of the strike starting on Monday, there can be significant delays in transport: work is suspended for an indefinite period of time, part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volan companies, can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a halfway closure on many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, and these lists are constantly updated on the League's hobby.
Some organisations have indicated strikes for an indefinite period, others have declared temporary termination.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Organisation of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZ) could not agree on a sufficient service, and with Christmas holidays, more and more travelling on the railroads.
According to the so far communications, they strike between 7 and 9 hours in the Budapest Airport at BKV for 13 hours, four-hour strike between the LIGA Electrical and Heat Energy Professional Organisations, 2 and 2-8 hours in the morning, and the Pedagogues Professional Organisation and the Pedagogues Democratical Stake Organisation.
The Hungarian Medical Alliance strikes nationally, at changing times, the Democratic Professional Organisation (EDDSZ) of Workers in the SZEF Health and Social Society for two-hour warning strikes.
The four demands made by the League are essential that the government withdraws the presentation of the reform of health insurance and releases a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of calculating pensions from the next year.
Thirdly, in order to ensure that early retirement pensions are able to enter the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers of the League Professional Organisation (VDSZ) does not accept the Ministry of Economic and Transport of Railway Lines, but expects other tenders.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August in support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement, raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in various respects according to the Political Capital Risk Analysing Division.
In the company's "risk warning", the most important political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that, in the short term, even violent ethnic confrontations between the Gypsy and non-Gigian population in Hungary can develop.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act - added by the research institute.
As it was written, this can lead to one of the main delays of the Hungarian political actors: "The public debate on Roma is passed on by public actors to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian".
This deepens the problem, insults normal dialogue, strengthens the extremities and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - believes.
In addition, the research institute said that the activities of the Hungarian Guard were influenced by the great national and international media attention "to a significant deterioration of the image of Hungary abroad, particularly in terms of the country's stability and democratic development".
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremist groups in Hungary has become increasingly public and stimulated since the autumn, that more organisations called themselves the ‘national self-defence’ association in Hungary have been formed since summer 2007.
"The common feature of these congestions is to define themselves as a civil society organisation while they openly declare the preparation of their members - whether armed - of defence (katastrophe protection, defence, law enforcement), in addition to the police, the army, i.e. the state's inappropriateness".
It has been noted that this will take place in accordance with the method which, based on the political and duplication of society, attempts to put different political goals into civil society.
Therefore, the emphasis on civil society and the form of association are not merely intended to avoid legal failures to register in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-producing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, several neighbouring states also refer to the Hungarian Guard as a potential threat, and some neighbouring countries' ultra-nationalist political actors want to prove their own anti-Hungarian policy by reference to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has affected the political stability of the region."
According to the Research Institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As described, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass roma confusions that broke out in one quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU decided to make use of this by establishing the Guard, saying that the organization aims to "national self-defence".
For the last 17 years, they believe that there was a "cig terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remains indelible and indifferent - reminds the Political Capital.
They added: the initiative launched a rigorous debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, there is an increase in the risk of ethnic collisions that some Romanian organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance creates their own guerrilla.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot therefore be excluded that the Romanians in Hungary are responding to the threat by organising their own self-defense - can be read in the Political Capital's risk warning.
Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, their risk analysis is published annually, and if you experience something that might affect the change of risk, you will inform the public, as is the case with the issue of a risk warning.
It's not all over the place with red letters.
In Hungary, the law marks precisely the red-white days, and the holidays have become a general practice of working day reorganisation, which will be less than next year.
There is no single holiday in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and public holidays and holidays.
The holiday days are mostly linked to church holidays, to significant historical events.
We are also celebrating the new year: the last and the first day of the year is both a break - the latter is just for the New Year's Eve to rest.
All this year, we have a total of eleven red-white holidays.
National holiday is also the Memorial of Revolution 1848, which recalls the revolution of 15 March and 23 October.
On 20 August, we celebrate the state creation, on 1 May, and on 1 November and 2, we remember our relatives and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays are rarely due to the calendar for the weekend, working day relocation has become practice in cases where we work for only one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of the extended weekend is that we will not stay away from the workplace school on the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately prior to or after the celebration is to be handled is regulated by the Minister for Labour for Long Years in a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees who are employed, public employees and those in the public service relationship.
However, it does not affect the service firms and institutions operating on day-to-days in the course of the operator without interruption and his destination.
In this year, only the end of the year will change the schedule: from 24 December, life will stop in the country, as experience shows that the number of days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slifting" by the majority of people or using the saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we have more holidays at the middle of the week and end, so the workday relocation will be less than this year.
First, the day of the work is around the calendar, so that the workers can stay home for four days.
The Saturday of April 26 is a working day in exchange for Friday 2 May.
The second transfer is linked to the holiday of 23 October: on October 18th, Saturday, you will have to work instead of 24th on Friday.
The end of the year may, however, be at the celebration for the future, because almost every single day from December 24th, there will be a nonstop break even if the New Year's Wednesday falls.
Six horrifying tiny things to upset your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, voice mails that we never get, innocent lies, which we almost don't notice: they're "coloring" every day at work.
The question is whether you get used to little discomforts or pick up the gloves and avoid consciousness of situations that cause misunderstanding to others.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you you were looking for the marketing department" said one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, he regrets and tries to make things right, perhaps invites the marketing class to tell you that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, an apology is taken care of.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, it is worth considering what makes you feel unpleasant for your colleagues and consciously trying to avoid this.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
It's not more annoying than when you touch a paper, office or phone, and it's not anywhere.
Do you remember putting your stove on the table yesterday, but it was on his feet by morning?
Maybe you'll cover up your pen on one of your colleagues' desk?
Without asking, don't take anything from your colleagues because they'll be rightly angry with you to ridicule their property.
Don't put a pocket on the office envelopes, post-its, because it's gonna be uncomfortable if it's out of time, and you're gonna need it right away.
Are you rumoring about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the already spreading rumors.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don't tie your information on your colleagues' personal life to everyone's nose.
If one of them shares the intrinsic secrets with you, don't back up with his trust.
Describe the hearers in yourself, and do not discuss with your colleagues in distant absence, even if others are aware of your colleague’s dealings.
Are you an uninjured patient?
When you call the office, and you mean a sick person, referring to diarrhea headaches, because you have a bad feeling of complications or feel that you'd rather rest that day; think that your work, your unforgettable work, your time-time work needs to be done instead of you.
Don't spot me with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to go into the office the next day, or you'll have to intervene for something you need to stay home, tell your colleagues and your boss not to face your shortcomings the next day.
Squirting, Squirting, Telephoneing
Did you get deep into the job, but that's where the coworkers are dragging you out?
Did you have an unwanted ear witness for a phone conversation that would've been better off hearing?
Don't bother your colleagues with snoring, singing, loud conversation (which you're on top of their heads), nor with feet, constant screaming, noise discomfort.
They can all be confusing, even if they are not deepening into a project (written, design, organisation).
Are you accusing others of mistakes?
If there's nothing left for time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, no other reason for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the potential chaos in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage to someone else, and remove the vest.
Ask him how to make your mistake right, replace the delay.
Do you feel too home at the office?
Cocktails and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but it's not in the office!
Don't pull a comfortable outfit if you're allowed to work.
Don't be slamming, colleagues, and respect yourself by going to the office in a routine dress - if your workplace requires you to go to the office, pretty, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're not interested anymore.
Arranged with the car in the usual morning stopper.
There's a special song from the radio: a violin voice that is associated with electronic effects.
I'm going to turn up the tone.
The music changed speed, and the bass arrives next to the previous sounds, and then a woman's choir turns into a real jewelry.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
The home music life has not been absurd for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems quite different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new and exciting productions coming from the digital underground of the home, changes slowly in the overall picture, and even the fashion of the guitar-cleaning garage again, the domestic electropop also proves that there is new under the sun.
Zságer started from Pécs Balázs, and you played in the orchestra of Yonderboi, until - perhaps, because two stalls didn't go in a twist - on their own road.
With its project (Zagar) and music, which combines the jazz, the electronic dance music, the pop elements, but it began to break through when the film soundtracks were requested to compose (e.g.
Turk Ferenc Seson).
At the beginning, the formations of the smaller clubs were recognized by the wider audience when the first album of the wan2 magazine in 2002 was listed as fifty main home albums and called Zagar in the company of Yonderboi to be marketable domestic trendmakers almost alone, even in the West.
Unquestionably, Zagar and the band became "trade", but of course, no one asked if they would like to wear the label.
The band responded as needed: made a new, better record.
The album that has just appeared in Unable Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself wishes to create continuity with the first pecs years.
This is why Balázs Zságer was an old orchestra.
We would be in place with airline reference, but in addition to the aeronauticity of music, the effects of the louder guitar, rock and roll, have now been seen - according to the spirit and trend of age.
In these songs, on the Millennium premiere of the album, the singer, Ligeti György, who is currently working with the Puzzle band in England, showed himself.
The album also served a real radio hitter, and Mr. Petőfi, who played popular music from the morning to evening, started smuggling into the ears with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas") recorded Wings of Love's great songs.
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu Zságer asked Balázs.
hvg.hu: This new slager is now asking the question: how much is the music you have left to play?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of layer music does not mean too much to me.
I think there are two types of easy music caste; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Alternative, underground music can also be flattering, nonsense, and can be prepared to sell them in the same way that makes them commercial.
But you can make a good pop with honest motivation.
Your inclusive attitude is also in the spirit of this, irrespective of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences for your music?
Zs.B.: There are greater traditions of light music abroad, especially west of us.
It's not just the 12-year-old class that goes to the concerts, but also the older.
They are more closely monitoring the easiest musical changes around them, as it is also considered as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good to have more and more attend our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is born not for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived in concerts where it already works on each other, but it only lies in the unacceptable changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you wanted to respond to the audience, you're no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works in solo, and he built his career from us to the west.
Zs.B.: We're not really walking his way, regardless of how they sometimes try to explain this to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other musical presence and lets it out.
At first, of course, it was inevitable to compare our work to the music of Yonderboi, because many of us were made out of his orchestra and left another way.
Hvg.hu: On the top list of Petőfi, the first place was Wings of Love.
Many people first heard the name Zagar.
Did you know that you opened the popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a slager and then sell the album.
This song is more than that.
We were designed for the album's finale, with which we tried to relieve the album's voice orgy and the more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when it came up with the idea that this choir should be made up of good voice soloists from our own home music scene.
This is how the six-member choir, the Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Peterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci, who was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this what the girls designed or transformed into it?
Zs.B.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record material came together, we thought we needed something else for this number.
The time frame attracted me to get a singer to find out.
That night, I sang up the song that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first and scary spontaneous thing.
I remember he was very shiny at that time, but of course the Dives needed it.
My voice wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and on the concert seemed to be the girls in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they do not have their own role, they sing completely together and are not louder than music, so music is not just following their songs.
They were on the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that you were in the back was just because of technical problems.
But it's conscious that we didn't want to share solo roles.
The number is about this to forget a little bit about the ego from where he's headed, just let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: Which one was most of the work with?
Zs.B.: There were harder pieces than the musical creative process.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play in a race piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to operate for a long time, and then slowly everything was in place, like a play in a play.
Hvg.hu: Which one of your favorite numbers is your new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concert and by letting the record go.
Now the Prophet is a fool, the Escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions because of a minority feeling.
It's unfaithful.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Générale banknote, called Jerome Kerviel.
Because Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to reach his colleagues at all.
Unlike the other banks, he recognized the American mortgage market crisis in time.
"He has a reduced spiritual ability," he said to his superiors notifying the police.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s statement reveals that it obtained EUR 1.6 billion of profits from its business at the end of the year.
It's not just a crisis in America.
"I just wanted to make money to my bank," she claims.
During the summer of the American crisis, he managed to earn half a billion euros.
Because he felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news reported that there will be problems with so-called subprime mortgages to customers with low-income or past cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and put a good horse on it.
At the end of the year, its profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"But when I was looking for the first half a billion, I didn't know how to report," she admits Kerviel and adds that she didn't keep anything.
He acknowledges in his opinion that he faked his reports so that it could not be revealed.
You were able to fool your bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange started to inquire for your transactions.
The risk was profit
You were afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
"I thought it was the fact that I was earning 1.6 billion to the bank, that it would reassure them."
Where did you want to risk that much?
He got his position gradually.
After the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale in 2000.
His annual salary moved around $55,000.
Two years later, he was a broker assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with 90 thousand dollars per year.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, in my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
My graduation, my professional and personal development," told Kerviel to the detectives.
The first great success came shortly after his entry.
Allianz's shares made a search because he raised half a billion euros for the fall of these shares during the bomb attacks in London.
And it started lavina - she wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses are supposed to know everything, or they'd rather scare me.
"While I was looking for money, I lost my eyes."
But there was a hit at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
In the middle of January the weekend, he wanted to cover up.
When he went to work on Monday, he didn't work in the bank anymore.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion.
And how did they find out?
His freedom became suspicious.
"In the last year, I took only four days.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to see his reports," Kerviel finished.
Czech Republic 365 billion is likely to be acquired
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
It costs about 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will receive about 100 billion kroons of sums from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, is for transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22% of the funds available for Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of transport infrastructure, which will be hosted by the next 90.8 billion kroons.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also obtain resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful in winning funds from the EU funds in the context of the newly hired countries.
Former President of Nicaragua approved the 20-year prison sentence.
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Appeal Court approved a 20-year prison sentence to Arnold Aleman, the former President of the country, for which 100 million dollars were sentenced in 2003 (approximately 1.8 billion) for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in domestic custody near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 is going back behind the bars is not clear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the head of the prison whether Aleman is to be discharged or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that government funds were regularly referred to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These philosophy companies and their accounts were actually relatives and their closest supporters.
These funds were subsequently carried out by some of the foundations, which were based on the financing of Alemán's election campaign in 2001.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the budget of the first coalition majority adopted by this government without the support of the opposition.
This year it was still going through the support of the Social Democrats last year, since Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party were not allowed to accept it.
Unlike the debate before the vote on the lack of confidence in the government, there was no drama this time.
This was generally ignored, although the most effective law was adopted by the House.
It's a certain contradiction.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the battles of government and opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
Discussions by politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the previous Social Democrat governments have been struggling with three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory sovereign expenditure, which is not only pension but also social benefits, which last year were approved by ČSSD and KSČM's silent 'coalition' before the elections
The second is the first deficiencies resulting in deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budget of cities and cities.
However, the highest risk is not the public budget deficit.
This is publicly and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and walks.
A number of mayors can also earn money for other investments other than taxes, taxes and bank loans, and they have often issued bonds with which their city houses have been disproportionately debted.
In recent years, these debts have been cleared by massive sales of the shares of energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely on formal and verifiable facts only, we shall state that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase like the rest of the world for a few years, with the Czech Socialist Party continually glorifying.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to settle public funding.
Instead, the country was more and more debt-driven.
The rest of the countries have been more reasonable than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, in one of the two exceptions.
This is primarily a huge shame for previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least threatened by poverty in global standards.
Therefore, for example, there is no need for huge social programmes, which unfortunately have swollen into huge size in recent years.
Although this year, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditure approved before the elections has been eliminated, even if the limit of retirement and retirement is not in the near future, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever will be governed, it will be just an office call.
A little exaggeration can be said that most of the taxable money from the governing politicians generally become pensioners and social benefits are mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the reduction of normal expenditure by the executives' expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not destroyed everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not really want it to happen to become mere officials from governing politicians, then we need to be patient and we need to wish our peace to prepare the further reform laws for this unduly strong coalition government that the state can only give out what it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only these will allow a progressive balance of the budget to be achieved.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The central banks of the Federal Bank of America, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis of the financial markets.
Money markets are thus costing over $100 billion in stock exchanges.
These stock exchanges raise interest rates on the bank for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed provides $40 billion for its stock exchange and makes twenty more available to the European and Swiss Central Bank.
After the 11th of September attacks, it is now the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed in a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, the Economic Outlook Group advisory company.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to about 50%," said Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars in the United States, mainly due to unpaid loans.
Employers are counting on billions more losses.
"Central banks can really fear what could happen if they decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, headmaster of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he said.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves are in difficulty accessing the loans, they will lend their clients more expensive.
This would reduce the need and the American economy with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided not to succeed in reducing the so-called LIBOR, the interbank supply interest rate in London, which is used for borrowing money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of reciprocal borrowing, even though the US, Canada and the United Kingdom's central banks have reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
"It will have a similar effect to this further reduction," said the Reuters News Agency Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps taken by the central banks contribute to addressing the crisis as it does not solve the basic problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible disputes between ecologers
Global climate change threatens the most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated an opinion on the global warming problem.
This time, the UN has criticised its international conference on climate change in Balin.
The book Blue, not the green planet, presented in Vienna, stated that the ecologers’ debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, the structure of the conference is not only unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between the successive rhetoric and reality.
"The debate there absolutely lacks the structure, it is only words to throw, which are supplements to the solution of the current problems," said Klaus.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for his subject, which is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction, above all, that the book is also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet his caricatures."
So now interested parties can read their undistorted opinions.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient grounds for writing such a book.
As professional meetings have been monitored and evaluated as academics in statistics and economists.
In the end of the book, it has been stated as a thesis that climate changes are constantly changing, i.e. changes to normal, and as far as the planet's warming is concerned, all scientists do not agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and severe, so they do not pose a threat and the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, the imposing of unproved opinions on others is unacceptable, which is perceived as a dangerous freedom restriction.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of the present people that "the environment is not against reasonable protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Similar topics were discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand couldn't replace their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and couldn't change their old license in time, which ends at the end of the year.
Today's last day, when you can still apply for the exchange, the offices will be able to set up a new licence in good time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year a hundred thousand drivers would be on their way without valid entitlement.
According to the offices, the licence was mainly not replaced by those who are no longer willing to drive.
In the meantime, while the courses are a rigorous fall in interest in the exchange of licences, offices in the capital have been flooded with applications for the exchange of licences, for which interest has been increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour in line.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet been replaced by around 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new driver's license will take 20 days.
However, the new licence may be requested by a shorter period of five days.
However, in this case, the driver has to pay plus 500 crowns.
Drivers who are unable to exchange compulsory licences by the end of the year and who are on their way with invalid drivers are threatened by punishment from January.
The guilty must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also deal with the riot.
In the event of an administrative offence, the penalty shall be 2500 kroons.
On the basis of previous information from the city house, you may also receive a fine who is not traveling anywhere.
They say you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called upon the offices to be relentless and to impose up to a thousand crowns of penalties.
However, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, says that ten thousand fines are not threatened by anyone.
He believes that the driver's license is a document where people can decide whether or not they want it.
This is not an ID, which must be valid for all.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should cancel the driver's license.
It's enough to take it or it's recommended to post it to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, licences issued from 1964 to 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must also gradually replace the other types of drivers.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may be replaced for three more years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court has reduced the punishment of detectives cooperative with Berdycci.
Mr Opava and Mr Koňařík were former police officers who were suspected of being confronted with David Berdych's criminal council, being sentenced between 13 and ten years.
The Supreme Court in Prague has determined that one of them has been punished for a period of two years.
Detectives in the Praha Crime Division were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, and the review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, it is only awaiting the first sentence.
In other procedures, a total of more than 16 years have been punished.
You can't get any more.
In January the Court of Justice of Megyei mainly found 19 people guilty of assaults, of which 16 appeals were discussed today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation by the fact that it was a speculation case.
According to the Senate of Central Czech Republic, the members of the police were also provided with information from police sources after the agreement with Berdycci, covering the individual robbery attacks and helping the gang to avoid alignment with criminal responsibility.
The band therefore sold 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňaří.
The prosecution is about crimes in the band between 1999 and 2001.
Firstly, robbery victims have suffered severe health damage, but also abuse of the authority and unauthorised arms.
Because the police had illegally held guns, steel-seed bullets, laser control or machine guns during the home investigations.
The gang is accused of exploiting ten million crowns of robbery.
Without 20 members, the courts have already admitted guilty of other robberyes in Berdych and many others.
Further members of Berdych's environment will be witnessed before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first trial so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulejt, who are under prior arrest in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on the Czech Republic's criminal proceedings for their expenditure.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, from the třebíč hospital, demands 12 million crowns of pain plus legal expenses for children who have been replaced.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, strongly disagrees with the proposal.
"We refuse such a claim because it's too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"We need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent in order to make an opinion on the objection.
We'll find out if there's any value to be used.
But we maintain that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," stressed Dostal.
He believes that the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč between the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for each month until he raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba provided an expert judge based on compensation negotiations, developed by the University Hospital of Motol of Prague in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrist experts, children’s parents have suffered different degrees of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was more tolerated by the men, even if they met with such a disgrace that they did not hinder the exchange of newborns.
Women are suffering worse with the current trauma and what's happening right now, combine Veleba's content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses on 9 December in the birth of třebíč.
Last week, children returned to their blood-based parents - Nikola Čermaki, Přibyslavic, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina’s expedition leader Miloš Vystrčil gave up 100,000 crowns to replace his family’s expenses resulting from the fault of the hospital in třebíčské, which is controlled by the walk.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory damage insurance under the law.
In the event of a misconduct, they shall apply to the reserve base, in exceptional cases they may request the founder's assistance.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally, a few million kroon tables.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Vicalsko
Bolek Polívka lost the case for the title of the kingdom of Vicisko.
According to the court of Ostravai, he first used the name of the King of valachi, but the team around Tomáš Harabiš, which collaborated with the actor, developed the project with many years of work.
Polívka didn't take part in the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team living in the popularity of the Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks the words of the Valachi kingdom all the actor-comicals come to his mind.
This opinion is also shared by Harabiš.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding out money and making up action," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In the years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could win something.
They want to live from our work," he did.
Income business
According to the court, the name of King valachi was first used by Polívka in a television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing valachi’s passports.
The original student cíny was a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabiš was based on the creation of the societies of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
In 1997, by signing the name and signature of Polívka in the passports, and by visiting the farm and theatre performances of their owners.
Who's taking over the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš was only using the idea that Polívka had made public in Manes for its business.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity must have helped the Valachi Kingdom project," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabiš and his team intensively involved.
The cooperation of today's controversial parties continued until 2000 when it organised official crowning of Harabich Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been discussions between Polívka and Harabish, which have been confronted with the redemption of "King of Boleslav forever chosen".
In the Kingdom, the leading role in the initiative of Harabiš was Jarmila Šuláko, as the Queen of Mother.
In 2002, Polívka brought an action against Harabiš and his associates, rejected by the court today.
Light in the debate, the battle planned by Harabish could be brought to the throne and half the queen.
It's supposed to be a new king for this fight.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the time yet.
"We don't want to catch anything.
It's supposed to be something like the Slovakko kingship.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can be in touch," said Harabiš.
Test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: disappearing prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeo 206.
Its features are nothing special, the quality of change, driving and production can often be marked below average.
But the market is already a successor, the Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a lot further, so it's all I have left to think better.
When I tested Peugeot's 207 classic hatchback, I complained, for example, at the back seat, to the place left for the head.
This time, the complaining is over here, because the corridor of the complainant means that giants of two metres are no longer suffering in this regard.
Swimming in the World
I'll get through the interior soon so I can't repeat myself many times.
It is a relatively well-made design, where my only excuse for the poor console is.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom or arm.
The sidelines have also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, the increase in the size of the corridor can also be seen here.
Afterwards, there are few places mentioned in the trunk.
I'll go to the trunk.
This vehicle is therefore the main package.
This must be very accessible (also thanks to the outward rear window) and as a spacious area.
The vacant places are equipped with barrels, which are ideal for compromises.
They're not in the way, they're dispersed, and they can handle harder objects.
But let's just stick to the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables of the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is more the average value of competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most wanted car - against the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the product of the new generation in mlada Boleslav, we find that Peugeot is well behind many 52 liters.
This value is almost critical for foreign holidays or for the entry of a baby car.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost entirely straight floor after the back of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a four-wheel, alien-ignition engine with a capacity of 1.6 litres of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how you're supposed to look like a thousand thousand who run the family hatchback.
Silent, low consumption and mainly pull.
If we compare Škoda's equivalent, which often feels like they've put rags in his exhaust, I'm just happy about it.
Rate of price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we need to remember that we tested a car with a spacious internal space and a very good engine.
The car with a four-wheel alien engine leaves for 329 900 KC.
The car begins with 410 990 Kč, which is a lot.
The equipment of the Premium tested will be thrown by 80 000 Kč.
But we even had our headbags, our automatic climate, our automatic window wiper launch, our back windows were also electrical remote control...
That means the car costs 531 900 KC.
This is a lot, but count the additional Fabia equipment and get very similar results.
So there's nothing left behind but the decision to make the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local schools.
Integration of Eastern Europeans is currently faced with a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents have become violent.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated in a situation in the north of the country where their positions and Slovak immigrants are growing.
Discussions between students, bondages are already characterised by parents’ relationships.
The situation was that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who had a ten-year-old student with iron rod.
Guilty defends the boy's insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to take care of two twelve-year-old girls after the attack on Slovakian immigrants.
The girls claim to have been simulated by racist comments and thrown with stones.
"When we were headed home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop this, he struck us with apples and claws and then he discovered his naked back," the mother of Slovakian students wrote the new unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One of the local residents classified disputes about the Eastern European immigrants as a survival fight.
The above cases suggest that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, Slovaks searching for 70 thousand jobs are recording.
About 30 thousand Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
The island of freedom for visitors is indeed the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you answer correctly.
The golden and white coasts, high waves, or the sea, are calm as a fisherman.
Paulma trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or mamorous cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a complete and more rich list.
However, you can find much more on an island, and this is the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spaniards, Cuba was a host of their American conquerions.
Colombus called the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havanna became a treasure warehouse and a transhipment warehouse that was robbed and transported to Europe by the Spaniards in America.
Then the American era came.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mob, was built because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially a seizure) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among others, for example:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, the towerhouses were built, and cars that had become a symbol of the cult of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and was his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated by the signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
And today?
The wall of Bodeguita in Havanna can be provided with your handwriting.
The dear Nacional Hotel is a cocktail you want in the bar.
And the cult cars of the 50s are travelling in Havanna until today, as the former exported and their sons have fled in these salt and wet airs long ago.
Although the oldest part of Havanna was substantially devastated, there are no more beautiful monuments anywhere else in the area than there.
Other places are even more beautiful, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides so much necessary money, its development has been a green path.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world offers another unique guinea pig, which is mostly appreciated by train enthusiasms.
From their extended crops, sugar cane was transported into sugar plants steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so there are machinery that have been seen in museums.
Where are we going?
Most of the visitors in Cuba do not avoid the most famous places.
So you don't have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Maybe we should just remind you that there is a museum on the Hemingwaybirds that have already been mentioned, and who loves the writer shouldn't miss the visit of this museum.
Cuba of the Viňales Valley is one of the most paintings in the west part of the island.
Buy vegetation grows from a limb.
Artificial stones, lime mountains and rocks are rising steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their grains, a fertile soil is gathered, which also covers a dense plant.
The valley is a place where Cuban tobacco is perhaps of the best quality.
The final form of a cigar production plant in the month may meet at a visit.
Some might find it interesting to see that Major Zeman's episode in Chile was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spanish.
The trade in slaves and sugar has brought reputation and glory.
The economy has a body filled in the beauty and monumentality of the non-great city.
In the course of four centuries, the colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by subsequent French immigrants, has almost nothing changed.
The Escambray planes and sea Trinidad are so misguided that even in the 50s of the past century there were no roads that would have linked this country with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped to stay an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't even unleash, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If a man has more than one afternoon to Trinida, it's worth looking at the interesting locations of the neighborhood like the Playa Ancón beach or the Candy Valley.
And tonight, it's good to go to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after darkness, where music will only be quiet by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the towns located in the east of Cuba are viewed as the most beautiful city.
This opinion must also be influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo must overcome high and staggered mountains, which are almost barely affected by human activity.
Due to the uninterrupted nature of Cuba, UNESCO added its eastern tongue to the World Heritage List.
Here the best chocolate is made, in the church there is a cross of Colombus (in reality a hundred years after Colombus sailing) and a hill where the former castle was standing and today the El Castillo hotel is located, some of which are most known to El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro planes, Sisno Bay, Isno Bay and Isla de Pinos, Tropicana cabaret, Caridad del Cobra of Cuba, Santeria, African religion, which is confessed by the successors of former slaves, can be written a lot of things.
I mean, as you say correctly, it's better to see once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claiming the Americans
The lack of military and necessary equipment also affect the course of the United States of America's mission in Afghanistan.
According to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should present concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghanistan mission does not take place according to the ideas, and the Heads of the Countries have agreed in Edinburgh of Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries also consult on further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Minister of Defence Robert Gates was called on NATO troops to be more active this week, the UK considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid to be a priority.
"Afghan development can be tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the population to further develop the economy and security itself," said the British Minister for Des Browne, the BBC.
Ninety percent
The Afghan uprising activity is according to the US government's records of the most powerful in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the Southern Helmand region.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, approximately one quarter in southern areas.
However, according to the United States, alliances also had their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to train Afghan troops.
"We really need to think about the specific goals for the future and the methods to achieve them," Gates řekl.
So was Jaap de Hoop, the NATO secretary-general.
"I'm not glad what's in Afghanistan on earth and air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's little," said the Reuters news agency De Hoop at the end of the three-day discussion with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Passive
In recent months, there are also debates between the participating countries on whether all all all the allies are providing a maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticised, for example, for its passiveness.
"Germans are relatively large in numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least violence and fighting requirements are thus not as high against them as we are in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The Sun British bullfighter called German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan journalists have been discovered: The Germans play until our sons fight," wrote Sun in the material supplemented by the photo of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild attacked and published a photo of a group of British rugbimeccs in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The public debt will reach one-million in 2009
Every Czech is a 84.000 crown government debt.
By the end of September, the total debt reached a crown of 842.7 billion.
The government is planning to borrow a 159.2 billion kroon this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroons thanks to the better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic's public debt reached a crown of 842.7 billion.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, from June, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today verified the state debt data from the beginning of October.
All Czechs have more debt than 84.000 kroons.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
"On the one hand, thanks to the lower deficit in the next year, the one-million coronary threshold seems to be only possible in 2009.
The following year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion crown," said the analyst of the iHNed.cz server, David Marek, Patria Finance.
Similar to this, the analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "In 2009 we can move through a billion.
That precisely when, the next budget that is not yet known depends.
If you were to prove that the policy situation would change, the politicians would be willing to back up more, this could go away by 2010.
But I don't assume this change," he mentioned.
Increased debts
State debt is the debt of the central government, which is primarily due to the accumulation of public deficits.
State debt is financed by cash notes, public bonds, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion kroons.
The foreign debt of the State has risen by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called "saled state debt" reached the 803 billion kroon and decreased by 13,7 billion kroons from June.
The average debt debit has risen for 6.5 years.
"The debt between the whole year has increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite abundant to the economic progress.
Interestingly, the increase is primarily generated by bonds where the increase is 20%.
The bad thing is to increase the debt, but on the other hand, this shows how to trade when the retirement reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
It's better than the wait.
From the financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007, it is clear that the government has planned to raise a loan of 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroons thanks to the better development of the public budget.
The amount is primarily the public budget deficit, which is likely to reach the amount of 76 billion instead of the expected 91.3 billion kroon this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kroons, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, a loan financing of 43 billion kroons of public bonds and a cancellation of loans of 1.8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher presents today at a carduum court for a name given to a brown bear.
On Thursday night, a Cardum court sentenced the British teacher in Sudan for 15 days to be imprisoned and deported from the country because of the violation of Islamicism - his lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing his 6-7-year-old students to name a brown bear as Mohammed, but the Islamic religion forbids any depiction of his prophet.
Such an act can be punished by stunning.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was educated at the Unity High School of Cardum, was arrested in her apartment Sunday. According to the 125th paragraph of the Sudanian Penal Code, she was accused of violations and rebels of Islamicism after the parents of the students filed several complaints against her at the Sudan Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked his 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class’s feather bear.
"The children proposed a total of eight names: including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says Robert Boulos, the school director.
At the end of the 23 votes, 20 children chose Mohammed's first name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then made a joint diary with the picture of the cat and "My name was Mohamed."
The problem lies instead in the fact that any depiction of the Prophet is a violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague at the same school, said that he knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything to offend any religious belief.
Many of the students of the teacher agree with this opinion, and they believe that the teacher "he treats children very well" and "he never speaks about religion in the class."
Let us not forget that the second most popular first name in Great Britain is Mohammed, and there are 14 different types of writing in English.
This is one of the ways of expressing respect for the Prophet by Muslim families so many times. (Gyakran receives this name from the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given, for example, a game?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna trial in Wednesday.
The end result is failure.
Without approaching the positions, the meeting between Serbians and Albanians in Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, on the sixth and last of the future status of the Separatist Province.
"Sorry that the parties have not reached agreement on the status", EU diploma Wolfgang Ischinger announced at a Vienna press conference.
The American Ambassador Frank Wisner underlined that peace in the region is at risk and encouraged Belgrád and Pristina to continue their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after negotiations.
"In the near future, there is no need to be held violent, but there is a very difficult period", he added, emphasising the existence of manifest tensions.
The Mediation Ends on December 10th
Last Monday, he visits Serbia and Kosovo, the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia.
In 90 percent, the future of the population of Albanians can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alekszandr Bocan-Harcsenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting near Vienna, Baden, reported the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the United Nations had relied on the troika in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians who in the Security Council have already failed the issue of Kosovo's independence will continue to negotiate after the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiating solution, in favour of the compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
A unilateral independence statement?
After eight years of Kosovo under the UN, western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina announced that he was willing to make a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council decided not to benefit him.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"We have failed to reach an agreement", reported the President of the independent region in Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu in the hotel in Baden, where the "last chance" negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the uprising of Kosovo and the future Prime Minister of the Province also expressed his regrets.
It added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be a "continuation of the history of murders and deportations".
"Domino Effect"
The Serbian President Boris Tadic thought that the compromise was still possible, and the majority of Albania in Kosovo warned about the consequences of the unilateral expression of independence.
Belgrade thinks that "domino effect" is still unstable in the area due to the wars of independence in the '90s.
"For Serbia this does not preclude the possibility of compromise", Tadic declared.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be solely the Security Council, where the Russian alliance has the right to bet.
"The last word will be for the Kosovo Parliament."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council", declared the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"Negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end as they started in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the last word will be the last word of the Kosovo Parliament." He added that the unilateral call of independence by the Albanians is based on "conciliation with the Western powers".
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed that they would immediately enter into negotiations in order to finalise the debate between their peoples for 60 years.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush made a promise to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the 'peace agreement' in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate the "terrorism networks" and Israel must quit with the colonial activity - they declared Bush, and reminded the two parties of their obligations on the "Bree Plan" adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the aim of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is to " sign a peace treaty that deals with all the problems involved, including central issues".
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestinia, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes in the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today's Israeli state.
Abbas, speaking after the President of the United States, maintained that future negotiations should be "global and profound" and touch all aspects of the regulation, such as "Jeruzsálem, refugee, borders of country, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, who comes to the floor, made a promise that future negotiations will be "intermediate and continuous", and he will strive to "finish in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush created the realisation of the "visio of two states" of Palestinian and Israel, which existed next to each other.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush received a promise before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (who took part in Annapolis as a success in Washington) initiated a plan in support of all Arab countries that guarantees peace for Israel if it withdraws from all the Arab areas involved in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is obsessed with the problem at the root edge and focuses on the central issues" - believes the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Arab newspaper of Saudi.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not liable.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it is common to be in such news, the official position and the speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN), a police car on the Louise-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel moved a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car's patroled, so he didn't take part in an operation. He's traveling 40-50 km/h, without a sirenic," we found out from a police source.
The young "high speed" without two helmets was driven by a green, "not included in the official register, so not used in road traffic" (see below) with Kawasaki's brand engine.
"Why they didn't follow the right hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a police officer.
The result of the alcohol test carried out by the vehicle was negative.
The strength of the impact is well shown that the front of the car is stuck, the windscreen star is crushed, and the pusher is down.
Pontoise's State Attorney General Marie-Thérèse de Givry reported yesterday morning's extraordinary announcement that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County's Public Security Directorate were entrusted with the investigation initiated by "injunction of manslaughter and assistance".
During this afternoon, the D.A. said at a press conference that in the current phase of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police can be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the storm arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
On the day yesterday, a line that the footwear unquestionably pulled on the road, showed that the two vehicles collapsed and went together for a while until the police car managed to stop it.
Vehicles have been booked for technical testing.
The body of the two victims carried out the medical examination yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, Villiers-le-Bel spread as a runner, the rumor that the police quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this respect, IGPN is cautious, but it does not rule out that the police would have made "any serious mistakes".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and it requires increased caution", we have learned from a police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of his windows is looking right at the location.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, we went immediately to try to revive them," says the witness.
There's nothing we can do.
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely confused and hurt me.
The other two tried to revive one young and the fourth called."
The tension among the presents grew, as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arrival police took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the eyewitness communication that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massage, but no matter what.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the young.
Young people have received help.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them," stressed the prosecutor.
Woman’s tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations of the emergency status introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to the witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country, Lahore, in the city of Lahore, wounded from tears gas bombs used by police forces.
In response, they threw the police with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked the lawyers and wounded them.
More people have been produced.
In Islamabad, the Advocates of the Supreme Court called for a general strike, and demonstrations were reported due to the arrest of about 500 opposition members, human rights warriors and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan, the central part of the country, and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the council of lawyers is also supported by the great Buthida Majlis-e-Amal, who has encouraged the people to send flowers to the judges who disagree with the state of need and waste the people who took the oath before Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan shall be directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court should make a statement on the legitimacy of the re-election of President Musarraf by indirect vote on 6 October in the coming days.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been moved from his office and has been replaced.
"Everything we witnessed is illegal, against constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf promised that he would leave the Army for the purpose of filling in the civilian presidential role after the emergency status was in force - announced on Monday, Deputy Minister for Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to make it up until 15 November, i.e. until the end of his first presidential mandate, from his military uniform.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed the news of postponing the elections in January.
The Pakistani Government, by the way, failed the country-wide speech that Mr Musarraf had appointed a place of forced residence as Chairman of Musarraf.
More than one third of pregnancies are not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unsuitable or unplanned pregnancy.
Even today, more than one third of pregnancy (36%) has not been planned - it is discovered in the study of the French National Demography Institute (Ined) for 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalising contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unsuitable or unplanned pregnancy.
Ined estimates that different contraceptive methods like tablets or bee spray are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, the Institute said that the liberalisation of contraceptives made "born regulation" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 were taking contraceptive tablets in 1970, but that is now 60%.
Now, eight of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth couple of months is designed with accuracy, and, if possible, by spring, because it's the most pleasant season for the child to receive.
Excellent repairs at the space station
Scott Parazynski's astronaut and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular improvement of a broken solar panel that is essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space walk has proved to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time to plan it, and very little time had to be done with "crowded" tools by astronauts away from the housing modules.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the spaceshipers separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of European and Japanese laboratory activities (see the framed section).
This module is a kind of portal to the laboratory modules.
However, they need to be ensured.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, that one module producing electric power using 17,5 tonnes of solar panels, which was already on the ISS, should be transferred to the final place.
Then the crew started opening the wide solar panels of 76 metres of the module.
At that time, one of the harmonizedly foldable tables infringed an impregnated cable of about 1 metres long.
In order to avoid further injury, the opening of the board has not been continued.
Astronauts originally had the task of making a control walk from Discovery's spaceline and then repairing another defective scheduling panel. Instead, they had to spend their full time improving the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynskire was chosen to make the show on his 30-foot robot arm reinforced to the station's daru.
He's one of the best "space walkers" in NASA.
He's tall, strong, extremely skillful, muscular with his upper body and a long arm.
So the 46-year-old doctor-grade man had to "open" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage caused, he cut off the faulty cable, and some "skin" fixed the damaged area.
In his work, he also helped another "space walker" who stayed close to the safe passage and from inside to other astronauts, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool used by it, a mini hockeybot that was insulated against the tension of the solar panels with hundreds of volts of voltage, the spacecraft of the station was fired out and "recognized".
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates opened the sign completely and then packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took a half-day rest, and today, seven of them returned to the Discovery Space Circuit to begin the return scheduled for Wednesday.
Rate of EADS shares
The price of EADS shares fell greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that manufactured aeroplanes and defence equipment announced that the extension of the development of the A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% reduction.
The company was forced to review its 2007 operating performance forecasts, since the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which obviously leads to a delay in the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay of the transfer of the aeroplane of the aeroplane for combat transport, which was reported in October, will be "increase €1.2 billion to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will be affected by Airbus" - announced the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the emergence of these expenditure, EADS should provide new plan numbers for its operating results on the next Thursday in 2007, when it submitted quarterly results - added the company but did not provide any further figures.
The Group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, the EADS operating result decreased by 86%: mostly from the delay in the development of the A380 giant machine, which also has a major financial burden on the company.
The company originally designed to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Stays in status quo
There is no big surprise for the Sunday elections: the vast majority of Russians will vote for the Head of State Putyin, the Single Russia.
In this, the need for stability of the Russians, to say, voluntarily governed, shows a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putyin speaks to the electorates in a television message via public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putyin is headed by the Kremlt Support Party, the Single Russia candidate list, which is expected to win a slight victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the conduct of the Head of State has not betrayed anything: it has only made a new run against the interventions of the western countries, which was the subject of the campaign.
"We know that the price of true democracy is what we want, therefore, to be honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any infringement", he added.
However, this is not the case, according to the opposition.
The opponent condemns the campaign in which they believe they put pressure on the electorals.
The leader of the Communist Party, General Zjuganov, says that "this is a dirty election in Russia not even at Jelcin's time".
After the defeat of last weekend demonstrations, the former chess world champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer said he could not continue to visit.
"The Russians are still thinking as "homo sovieticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who's following Putyin in the state chair?
The date of the first round of the presidential election was published yesterday in the Official Journal, which will take place on 2 March 2008 and the candidates may indicate their intention of departure by 23 December 2008.
Since Vladimir Putyin was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate cannot be extended.
But there's no other successor at the sight.
What role does Putyin play from March?
Are you going to be the Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as leader of the Almighty Alliance Party of Russia or the majority of Parliament?
Whatever happens, both Parliament and presidential elections will be won by the extinction power.
It's now becoming a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking about the "homo sovieticus" way: they don't feel like they can control their fate" - said Lev Gudkov, sociologist, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolaj Koposov, historian of Saint Petersburg University, goes further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed, and the traditional community spirit has hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putyin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people," says Maria Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "forsakenly rejecting their personal responsibility", which has been shown quickly after the demolition of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: 65 governors of the Common Russian local lists are headed by 65 leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West often carries out chaos, as was the case in the 90s.
The public's view favours stability.
In the spirit of this, the Russians will not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednyicsenko, a teacher of 54 years, says: "Why should we think?
The people in power aren't so bad, why should we replace them?"
Pressure memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, Bad Arolsen's archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and half million victims of the religious regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which contain 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen, which is located in Hessen Province, have so far been searched only for "humanitarian", i.e. only given a unique and name view for victims or descendants.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After every State ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Reliable information
Opening the Bad Arolsen file allows historians to carry out research on "the relocation of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health condition of forced workers" - explains Reto Meistern, Director of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may be suspected of homosexuality or mental disability.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The purpose was to investigate civilians deported or condemned to forced work on these grounds and to provide evidence of their internship, which may result in compensation.
Bad Arolsen currently has more than 300 permanent workers dealing with the processing of tens of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of great importance.
"These documents are essentially no innovation", stated Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the University of Technology in Berlin in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Convention would be signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now almost €60 billion in traffic at annual level.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - announced by Mr Peter Mandelson, European Commissioner for Trade and Minister of Trade in India, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers have already approved the European Commission's negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the South East Asian Federation (ASEAN) last April.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also the main foreign investor in India, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU according to the Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement may have an economic impact for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a flourishing market of 450 million people".
The 10 most important products exported by India have been replaced by the European Commissioner for Principal or Secondary Importers. The two giants, Europe and Asia each year, have been replaced by "EUR 47 billion" and "EUR 10 billion" services this week, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi. At the same time, he regretted that bilateral trade has not always reached its full potential. On Fridays, the EU and India will meet in New Delhi in the framework of the eighth Diplomatic Summit, which was attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Answer to the concerns: Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the financial market for five weeks
The Bank of England would like to relieve the restoration of credit conditions, so on Thursday, it announced that it would pump 10 billion pounds of English on the financial market, which would be available by 5,75% basic interest rate and, unlike normal, by five weeks.
"We want to highlight the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to plan their liquidity positions more securely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international financial market from 6 December" - it is in the press release of the bank.
According to the Bank, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be on the market on 6 December at 12:15 a.m. local time.
This is the first time that the Bank of England issues liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually a week.
In the press release of the Bank of England, it added that it was also "ready to take further measures" in order to adapt the interbank loans to the central bank interest rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has exceeded the level of 18 September: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer financial market crisis, Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest on the amounts pumped on the financial market, which has alarmed banks from receiving them.
According to the proverb (which only strengthens the price of pounds compared to the euro), many would have welcomed the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been more favourable and more discrepancies.
The UMP and the NC are not willing to examine the socialist proposal for the purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre group closed off the discussion of the articles of the Socialist Law on Purchasing Force, which corresponds to the rejection of the text itself.
The text negotiated at the Socialist meeting included about ten measures adopted by the Socialist Party's national office on Tuesday. These include, for example, an increase of 50% of the employment allowance, the recovery of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the restriction of rental fees.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles in proportion to 180:115, the discussion of the governmental party and the opponent that occasionally twisted into sharp speeches was finally interrupted.
Jean-Marc Ayrault, Director of the Socialist Delegation, announced that his group will revise all its proposals in the context of the amendment of the draft amending financial law, which will be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A New Festival is born
A number of talks about the new Philadelphian Music Festival, which was organized by C3 Presents, has now been announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be organized in New Jersey in cooperation with Melvin Benn's British producer company, the Festival Republic.
"It's an honor for us to work with a man who's launching today's American festival movement," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 also organises the music festival of Lollapalooza in Chicago and Austin City Limits.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey will be arranged, so there will be a way for a tent.
The festival is organized between 8 and 10 August in a 500 moon private area of about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Melvin Benn, the director of the Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's greatest festival organisers.
In 1989, he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80 000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palace with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic called the Latitude Festival to live in the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival producer, license management and organisational tasks.
C3's colleague, Charlie Jones, the Glastonbury Festival, called the "leginspiring event" that he's ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel with a European-style festival.
"The philadelphia scene has been chosen earlier, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to arrange this in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We negotiated the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm to our plan.
Unfortunately, however, because of the political powers of the city leadership, the organisation failed," continued by Charlie Jones.
"We were lucky to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to organise a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the residents of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park of Chicago, after having proven its exceptional festival organisers in 2002, the Austin City Limits music festival company.
The gross revenue of the two events was 9.8 million and 11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were organized at a city location.
"The European concept of Melvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our festivals are usually in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two models in some way, and to create both European rural mood and urban feeling in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's people, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiasticly supporting the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not speak of the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are sufficiently favourable to allow investment in such a event at a location that hopefully gives home to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "great" size, its inclusiveness is about 80 000 people of the Tennesse Bonnaroo Music Festival.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland will be a rock festival," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two of his partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together, are the C3 companies that received the most recent Billboard Touring Award recognition of the "best independent event organiser".
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to seduce Dutch directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator...
"Seducation" is one of the tasks assigned to the Montreal.
The mission is promised to be "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, oppose the shooting of its own production abroad.
Is it really hard to take up the fight with the "Terminator Governor"?
"We need to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best place.
If you find that the conditions are favourable in Montreal, you'll go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they will decide on our side," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte focuses most on promoting Canadian films.
The competition started for the Oscars.
The aim is to present and promote more québec films in every American film festival, whether the Sundance Film Festival, whether the denver, seattle or San Francisco film festival.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will be present at the Palm Springs International Festival.
The film Shake Hands with the Devil is also presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in Santa Monica and November.
Quebec also represented himself on the American Film Institute Fest event this month with four short films and four toys.
Will the end of the year rally be at the stock exchange? The experts' opinions are shared by the "subprime" crisis
Only five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and waiting for the end of the normal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view in December, the stock exchange is generally acting positively.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily valid, in fact, in the current situation, insecurity is characterised by the market, at least in the short term."
Experts do not prematurely support the stock exchange year's survival, although they say that "the stock exchange market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this is an opportunity to invest, because there are no alternatives with guarantees, in particular the fixed yield that has negative effect on the escape to quality securities, as long as in the short term".
They therefore believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a more side-oriented, volatility-free movement, "especially because the effect of the Fed interest rate reduction is not yet known, because the price of crude oil is high and also threatens to inflation tension".
Javier Barrio, responsible for the sale of BPI in Spain, therefore, it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation isn't rose."
Ibex's loss is almost 4 per cent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so brutal.
Juan Solana, according to Intermoney analyst, Ibex 35 may close the year closer to 16,000 due to the reorganisation of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes will be expected this year, as it will take a week after the long weekend of the Constitution after the second week of December.
The analyser considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the analyst of Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and "we can experience the loss of the stock exchange index, which can also rise depending on the news from USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysers agree with what will be securities intended to achieve the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "it's on big securities this year."
The expert would add the two large banks and some construction companies to the list, "when the electricity sector will be very expensive by then."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industry.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if there is.
"The ACS has been trying to get its position back for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main player of the remaining part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, the expert also believes that technology companies can do well, although representation in this area is not too high on the Spanish market.
In seven years, five times
In the last seven years, there was only two exchange rates falling in December.
The end of the real year was observed in 2003 when the stock exchange markets came out of the crisis caused by the exhaust of the technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17 percent back, 6,68% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open that 2007 will be the fifth profitable year after each other (in the meantime, Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español opens a drawer open from 200 Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Español decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This covers a total of 200 branches in the most relevant parts of Spain.
These drawers run under the name Popular Max and bring great changes to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions, because this is the first group whose branches are kept open in order until 20.30 a.m., even on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it intends to extend its accounts, has not taken the necessary steps so far.
But he's just making an agreement with the trade unions that his accounts would close 75% in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will decide on this basis whether they will join the initiative to support the more favourable open business.
This is the aim of the Banco Popular Español project.
I want to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local business in these places.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the already mentioned opening hours, since it is not a new opening order, but an existing transformation.
To this end, the institution modernises its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new thought of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
Commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, point out that there is no need for large investment in the restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which represents eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The drawers, even those who are set up for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourite Experience
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid branches.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The choice was made to the branches in the Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 branches.
More 60 work under the name Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants and also have a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In those units PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
They have reached an agreement with Telephonica and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco doubles its rival, the value of Antena 3 stock exchanges.
"We did it."
This sentence expressed satisfaction yesterday at the end of the market, Paolo Vasile, the megbízed advisor of Telecinco, when it turned out that the TV taxer he led doubled the value of Antena 3.
One thing, however, covered his joy: "It's just that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less", he said.
Even now, he put great emphasis on the weak market being "lower".
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase puts its annual loss to 15.66%.
52 percent of the company's Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento's stock exchange value is based on Bloomberg's figures of EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rivális, Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent yesterday, and can account for 40.5 percent drops since January, so he got half of 2.193.46 million yesterday.
The other registered communications companies value 3.571 million for Sogecable; Prisa (prisa’s publisher) is 2.518,53 million and Vocento with 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is considered to be a similarity between the two companies.
The question is how much we can do on the same market, on what costs, and how we can recover from this viewpoint.
The Telecinco last week announced that he wanted to be the first bruttal 1 billion commercial revenue channel this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and the subsidiary of the group's commercial affairs.
If the notified fact is met, the TV channel would increase its revenues from advertising compared to 965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006 by 3.6%.
The 3 net turnover of Antena increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (this reached 734,4 million), while the net sales of the television increased by 0.7 per cent (630,4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco's stock exchange rate is the high payout that has been retained so far: 100% of the profits of the company led by the President of Alejandro Echevarría in 2006 were distributed between its shareholders.
According to Vasile - although it's too early to decide - this ratio could change after 33% of Endemol's purchase, as well as with Mediaset.
"We guarantee the payment of a minimum of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be pleased this year, because with 33% of Endemol's acquisitions, we have already enjoyed them."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some weaknesses.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco by 7 per cent in 2008 and 2009.
It is said that the estimated increase in turnover from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent in 2009 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company forecasts that Antena 3's profits will fall by 4.5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, especially due to its high rent stability and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: you see Telecinco more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (continuation) because of the "multiple attraction" and the strength of business.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it proposes sub-prices due to "the same risks" (the market enjoyed and the less favourable economic climate).
The Congress approves the receipt of MiFID on 1 November
In parallel with Parliament's procedure, which ended today with the congress vote approving the amendments of Senate, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the regulation on the basis of the law so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups have consistently highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable standardisation of investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the business of companies, in order to ensure effective market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows modernisation of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Markets Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, and to create a new form of financial service (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI), with securities-distributors, and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of funds operations, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems that perform the execution of orders, which are competitive with the current stock exchange players.
In addition, the Law obliges investment service providers to market information on their business profiles, risk-taking and risk management methods and to facilitate the control of the CNMV, they shall keep records of all operations carried out.
The Congress Economic Committee has included a number of amendments, which are of the utmost importance that the securitised debts are treated as a "complex" financial instrument because of its high risk to investors, which is certain in the case of high-risk mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transfer of the directive has also been used to legally devise the activities of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent, who works for another account, does not need a CNMV licence and can sell or acquire products for several investor companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index grew by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the trend in prices in Spain for November.
This disclosure corresponds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature of their origin.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used to calculate the Uniform Price Index, but the statistical modeling method differs from the assessment of information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office underlined that the pre-indicator number is merely indicative, so it may differ from the final data to be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% of November was only "inconvenient", but it also indicated in advance that the price index is expected to show a "probably high" value in the coming months.
Solbes, in the corridors of Parliament, confirmed that "but the index is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain in the monetary union remained at the same level more or less in recent years.
He added that the month of November brought "lower surprise" than the previous month when the government did not count with such great growth.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economic Affairs recognised the information that was made public today.
Northern Rock would like to reach EUR 42 billion in the course of three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen back by more than 50% and currently only 12 billion pounds (16 billion € 800 million) since in the middle of September he had to raise an urgent loan from the English National Bank.
There was still a record number of deposits exceeding GBP 25 billion, with a gradual decrease in number over the last two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, even though the government promised a 100 percent guarantee to the bank at the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit in his own financial, commercial name, namely Virgin Money. Virgin will have to obtain about a quarter of the income of the British banks in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18 billion pounds, thereby reaching the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group of large-scale commercial campaigns in England has become known to spend about 50 million pounds (i.e. EUR 70 million) each year on advertising and marketing in order to reach the target.
The Northern Rock this week highlighted the offers of the Virgin Consortium as the most favourable to avoid bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Police have arrested the mayor of the town of Totana (People) in Murcia province today, as they suspect that he was involved in this week's exploded city corruption scandal.
In addition, a secretary of the City Hall and chief of police were arrested.
The former member of the City Congress member José Martínez Andreo took over the position of Juan Morales, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could have been head of the Corruption Network.
The police are further investigating city offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect of this week's crashed corruption scandal.
According to the SER radio transmission, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the presumed commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a galician construction company on reclassification of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE's nomination in Toledo and the President-in-Office of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the Prime Minister and also the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's proposal to conduct the PSOE's Toledo list at the next parliamentary elections and to complete the Presidential Office of Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary, José Blanci, and Bono himself confirmed this meeting with Zapatero this afternoon at the federal centre of the party.
The Head of Governance justified the election to the former minister that "we must count with the best" in politics, and Bono is "best among the best".
In addition, he added that "probably" the manchai politician will be candidate for the Socialist Party to the Presidential Officer of Parliament if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would take over the position of the current Parliamentary President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not intend to take up the next elections and to give up his political career in scientific circles, then fighting against climate change.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Head of Governance kept confronting him to return to the stage of politics since two years ago, he quit his active politics.
He added that since the electorates are aware of who the economic vice president will be in the case of the Socialists' victory, the party would also have wanted to inform them of who would be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "the colour of respect and not insult or screaming" and to be more similar to the home of the citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where it can't be spoken peacefully, has already been interrupted by the Head of Governance for 26 times in Senate."
At the same time, he said that the President of the present was Mr Marín, his "excellent work", but he did not want to mention himself as president, so that his opponents do not consider himself to be "governmental."
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement that promotes climate change is graciously persecuting both those who act sceptically against their forecasts and those who favour political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, you must set a political leader like Zapatero, who says that movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that "we have to make a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which its government's activity or inactivity contributed to the failure of Spain in the Union to comply with the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid it?
In addition, it should clearly explain to Spain what measures it intends to take to prevent climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population should change, what individual and social energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will be?
So who's to make a sacrifice and who's to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get and we won't even be able to explain these questions.
That's exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate changes have taken measures, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and costly for both companies and the public.
Even PSOE's increase in gasoline would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly revoked it.
That is, the Earth must be saved with nothing, mere propaganda texts, empty passwords without real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
As the Head of State, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even builds election meetings and awakening tenderness.
- No, no, no.
They arrested Mayor Totana and Chief of Police for a suspected corruption case.
The Police arrested the Mayor of the City of Totana in Murcai, José Martínez Andreo, the local police officer, the City Hall secretary and a guest company for crimes related to urban development, were informed by police sources today.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the Municipality of the Management of Industrialities and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in a case where two hectares of agricultural land were classified as an incorporable area in order to permit the establishment of 4000 dwellings of the company in Galician Nuaria, after having illegally paid a commission to the managers during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation according to the information provided by the Court of Justice of Totan.
Six arrested persons were given to the court.
According to official sources, Totana's former mayor Juan Morales, who today is also under examination of the independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who owns a property agency registered in Totana, is also being examined, as is the current friend of the previous mayor who lives in Murcia's province center.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A. attorney and entrepreneur was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José MG.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of offences commissioned at the National Government level of the Operational Unit of the Police, whose members have been investigating a number of other than arrests, in particular in companies related to arrests, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a company dealing with well-known poultry products in the area, who could play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest town park in Totana, with 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has acquired 2,2 million square metres of space in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the current 25,000 inhabitants.
Autesa e Iomonuar, Vigo in Coruna, Venezuela streets and Conycase, who was responsible for the direct marketing of the Ferdinand Square, was involved in the sale, promotion and installation of Hogar and building elements.

Our correspondent in Finland found this comment in one of the largest websites in Finland: (in the context of the PISA report on the world's cultural level), in Helsinki Sanom, referring to the criticism of Blackburn's book at the same time on 18 November.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High.
The killer quoted the writings of Platon and Nietzsche in messages from a student preschool.
The Education Counselor Pekka Elo, who was instructed to teach philosophy, demanded that teachers look at Platon's teachings with a critical view, and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important at the compulsory philosophy classes of high schools.

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains an error in downloading the Internet:
A. Downloading a music number is a sin, and it can be punished for a year from six months.
However, if you steal albums of less than EUR 400 in a store, it's just an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, stealing is a mistake, but the penalty still does not reach the level of punishment in case of downloading the Internet (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of punishment to be imposed when downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lower penalty if you get involved in a fight than you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you can receive a three-month penalty (Article 154 of the BTK), but a six-month and two-year penalty for copying the CD
(Article 270 of the BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Marketing of copyright-protected films is more punishable without authors' consent than selling pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).

My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following title: "The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less".
I mean, the feelings of the workers on the pay day depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was carried out by measuring magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest number of science.
The author of the study and the leader of the German Life&Brain Institute Neurokognition Group, Bernd Weber, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participants responded correctly, but the partner was mistaken".
Researchers have found that if both were given the right answer and received the same money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I don't know why it was such a big science for such a simple concludation.
General Attorney of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been haunted for eight years from the prosecutor's office in the Balkans' war criminals in Hague and the former Yugoslavia crimes.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of bitter mouth, as the responsible for srebrenica’s bleeding, during which 8000 Muslims were slaughtered in Bosnia, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnian leader Radova Karadzsics are still out there.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a documentary title: Carla's list (in 2006, Spain). The film, like real crime, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, as soon as it attempts to pressure the governments concerned to demand the hurok around the refugees.
What kind of insurance is that for me?
Vehicle insurance, which provides security to the owner of the car, will make significant expenditure against the various damages and will depend on several factors such as the age, sex, the date of obtaining the driver, the family condition, the type of car to be provided and the type of use of the car to be provided.
Buying the car is just the first step.
In fact, the choice of appropriate insurance is often more difficult than to decide which car we want.
First of all, we need to know what's going on.
The insurance of the car is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This Agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company accepts compensation in the head of the fixed insurance premium in the event of the damage.
The insurance premium is, in practice, the amount paid for insurance, determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the date of acquisition of the licence, family condition, the type of car to be provided, its use and others.
Insurers shall determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. pay a higher amount, which represents a higher risk of accidents.
That is why older people or women pay less than 25 years of age, as statistics say they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people are causing less accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, the frequency is the final.
The possibility of accidents increases more frequently than usual use.
A number of factors are taken into account by insurance companies when establishing the insurance premium.
Therefore, the owner should look carefully at the choice of the most appropriate forms of insurance in his profile.
The following are the key factors for the choice to adapt best to the demands provided and to create an acceptable price.
At the time of conclusion of the insurance contract, under 25 years of age people should be accounted for by a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of experience in driving and the update of the licence.
Although it is the most ideal if we are guaranteed against all the dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More prudent leaders can commit complete insurance with self-righteousness, thereby ensuring all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount to be paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the fee is, the lower the share it is" says Luis Noguera, the first European leader of the intermediary of the online insurance.
Another option is to extend liability insurance to third parties when the customer provides itself for the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused in his own car.
Besides, there will be insurance against theft, the fire and the loss of the car.
A good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, because this has an impact on the bonus and so you can reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
They call them a bonus for discounts compared to the basic rate of the insurance company.
We call the punishment for the basic tariff a malum.
"The scale of the bonus and malus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, you can afford to increase the level of bonus," explains Noguera.
Since the 25-year age limit has been exceeded, it is easier to provide adequate insurance to the owners, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
That's when we advise them to commit complete insurance with self - control.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experiences in an accident or even at the time of driving," states the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving when the leaders have already exceeded the fear of the starters.
If the insurance is already married, but there are still no children, the best thing is to do with complete insurance, of course, if financial opportunities allow this.
Insurance companies keep child couples for the lowest risk customers, so the fee to be paid is also lower in their case.
In this case, the best way to ensure full self-insurance is (that can reach EUR 300), or if you have a higher bonus, the insurance may be extended to the damage caused to the other person from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time their customers are greater and they can allow them to be higher in their share," confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with self-insurance (approximately EUR 150) or for higher bonus, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection to the owner in the event of damages, but also because it represents a high amount of expenditure, so it is essential that we select the customised forms of insurance properly.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eight-deck.
Milan and Celtic measure their strength in the San Siro stadium to obtain the missing point at the closing of the Champions' League.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round, they have guaranteed that they have access to a final with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more needed to ensure that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, does not prejudge it.
The D group will have two games one week before the end of the sixth round, because Milan has to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13th of the predecessor will try to fight for further access to the 16th final.
This D group will be closed sooner than the other, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the final, the two teams will strive to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and the Celtic will be the first to go from a better place in the eight quarters.
Even defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualitate itself if Shakhtar isn't winning, but it can't be certain, because if there is a point equilibrium, the Ukrainians will go on who lost Glasgow last week (2-1), but they won the next confrontation (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night of the Scottish, who would like to enter twice after each other into the eight-send of the Transnational Championship League, after being caught with a goal from Kaka in the extension of the 0-0 final (1-0) in the previous year.
Shakhtar would be the most happy winner of the "Rossonerik" because if Celtic loses, it gets into the eight-dollar and stays in UEFA.
Since Benfica is currently in the last place and is unlikely to remain in the European Championship, she can still get a third place with a win to play with in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend Spice Girls' first concert.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver (Kanada) started his tour, and they appeared in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Halliwell) have been announced in the Vancouver GM Place for a few minutes before the concert was organised.
Approximately 20,000 people have changed tickets to be on the concert, where a video film has been presented in the 1990s for huge successes on his joint history.
In Spain, the EMI has also placed a new album on the market with the joint reconciliation and tour, with the bigger slagers and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five members of Spice Girls from the husband of "Posh Spice", the British football player, David Beckham, entered the bracelet.
The athlete was also there on the GM Place stunning ground, although Victoria banned her a few days earlier.
When the performance was beaten, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "he didn't see our performance dress yet, so I'm nervous about what he'd think of the performance."
"Sporty Spice", was the reason that the band broke up two years after he quit the band in 1998, "because the members didn't understand each other." He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings about Spice Girls have changed.
Now I'm glad that I decided this way," said Chisholm about the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that in time, "the things are settled and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
According to the CTV, he arrived at the joint Vancouver on the special computer of Virgin Airlines.
There's a team of baby sitters waiting for them at the airport.
They have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team in California (USA), then San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7)
They'll be performing in Madrid on 23 December.
More fears about the Russian-Ukraine gas debate
The gas price debate has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect the Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) are carried over through Ukraine, and the debates between the two nations are always underway.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the gas price to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also damage Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between these two countries last year, the supply to EU countries decreased.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow was on the basis of the agreement attempted by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, which was the subject of the gas price to be paid to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that the 50 % increase in the price agreement with Ukraine for gas produced from the neighbouring Turkmenistan should be carried out in relation to the 2008 price agreement.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that we argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important countries of gas transport" - said Anatolij Kinah, the Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs, to the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the cost of transits to Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the last significant gas price debate between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas force leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also led to a large increase in prices.
One quarter of the European Union's gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplained.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply is complemented by natural gas from the turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "is required to control foreign workers"
The Scotland NHS committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe - an oversight body has declared.
The proposal was presented by Robert Black after a doctor with foreign citizenship in Scotland linked to the attack on the airport in Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed its concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, the report also pointed out, through the models of five health authorities, that key checks were carried out properly.
Following the attack on the airport in Glasgow, the Director-General verified the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, the doctor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interrogated by Old Bailey Court in October on charges of car bombing attempts in the United Kingdom.
In the case of workers from overseas countries, the NHS committees should verify the existence of the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned and the permits for employment in the United Kingdom before starting employment.
While Scotland Health Committees are applying Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
The report of the Directorate-General suggested, inter alia, that committees draw up the Criminal Registry Guide, which facilitates control processes with various overseas countries for employers.
"Although we found evidence of such checks in the records of staff, they are not regularly carried out," says the report.
According to Black, the Scotland NHS performs its own review procedure prior to employment at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas personnel."
Dr. Peter Terry, according to the president of the BMA Scotland, "incompletely unreasonable", we can identify potential NHS employees who can commit terrorist actions in the future, through pre-employment checks.
"The report states that pre-employment checks are working well in the NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent", he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas workers consisting of doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the Director-General has pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that the identification of undecided staff is a problem for committees.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, employment permits and professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks on NHS workers from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon's health secretary said: "I am very pleased that after the attack on the airport in Glasgow, this task was completed.
It added that, in cooperation with the health committees, the Scottish Government will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for all employees, including overseas, is reflected in the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published in the next month.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militant in terrorist cells was arrested, who were planning to implement an upcoming attack on an oil facility, as well as several attacks on churches and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
The supporters of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has acted as a federal to the United States since the Iraqi invasion in 2003.
According to the television report, eight cells led by a resident of foreign nationality are designed to attack an oil facility in the Eastern province.
After the attack attempt carried out by Al-Qaida in 2006 against the largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia started building a 35 000-person rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the Interior Minister's report, 18 of the arresters belong to a cell that leads to a "specified person specializing in missile deficiencies" which is illegally crossing the border.
The report also reported that the warriors were attempting to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom territory.
22 of the detainees had plans to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government called on the church leaders to harass the Saudians joining the Al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, who fight against the federal forces and the American-sponsored skite Muslim government.
Al-Qaida’s warriors consider a significant proportion of the heads of the Saudi Arab Church as involved in the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The warriors of the organization - inspiring the attack of the leader of the Saudi Head of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, of the Western-friendly Saudi Government - of foreign resident municipalities, government buildings and energy installations.
"The security forces have made huge efforts over the last five months" said a spokesman from the Ministry of Homeland to the state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person "median cell" was captured with the aim of spreading "tactical thinking". Tactical thinking is an ideology of the Sudanese Muslim radicals, which supports violence against the unfaithful and unfaithful Muslims.
There were also 32 persons among the arresters who were accused of the financial support of the militants.
The Venus climate can provide a view of the future of the earth
According to the scientists yesterday, Venus may have provided comforting living conditions.
The data of a European circulating spaceship indicate that this planet is much more considered as the world's witty twin brother on Earth than we thought earlier.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
In view of the size of the two planets, it is almost the same and its circumference is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the sun.
According to today’s scientists, several billion years ago, Venuson could have prevailed in a very similar way to Earth, and even inhabitable relationships could have been given.
However, due to the jumping high carbon-glass impact, the atmosphere of solar radiation and the lower rotation rate of the planet, Venus has gone into a different development path.
Today, the water is vaporized from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express on the basis of a year's survey of the planet provide an ideal picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Physics Department of Oxford University, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Make sure why the climatic climate of Venus differs so much from what has been experienced on Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are actually very similar.
"With our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario about the development of Venus billions of years ago, when it was possible to have living conditions similar to Earth.
"Police's deployed uranium"
A pound of radioactive material - according to the reports, enriched uranium - was taken yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was about enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for a million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Gate open
Mitt Romney says it's not worth a candidate to take a presidential election to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the presidential election agreed to take part in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters put their questions on the video and forward them to candidates.
None of the issues raised on Wednesday 28 November evening proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on the other party in YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected well the situation of the Republican party approaching the next year's election.
For the time being, it is not known that the manufacturers of the CNN co-financed the debate have selected the YouTube clips that were submitted to the candidates exactly on the basis of which.
The longest question of immigration was the first half of the debate.
This theme is one of the Republicans' compartments.
The CNN asked some of the uncertain voters to say that, if something that gives rise to them, they would call for a number: the mediator experienced a high consensus when the candidates spoke hardly about the question of the borders.
The most vivid and long-term debate was held between the leading Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney, a major pre-election in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that, during his mayorship in New York, he dealt too easily with the issue of illegal immigration.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former governor of massachusetts to build his house.
The word between them became particularly intense when the respondents were interested in supporting 'Amnesty' (which would provide illegal immigrants with a permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as representatives from Duncan Hunter in California and Tom Tancredo in Colorado - have been deeply involved in the subject.
And although none of them are considered likely to be on the label, their stay at the competition path may be explained by the fact that the bells of immigration began to be louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, a broad consensus can be observed among candidates: common objective is to strengthen borders and tough action against illegal immigrants.
This theme - as well as fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from the outside world - helps the Republicans in the bergets to make the division between Liberals and Christian Conservatives forget or minimise their size.
However, when other topics were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he used to support the arms control.
John McCain and Romney were confronted with the question of whether the simulated torment of water was to be considered.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates believed all the Bible’s words.
In this question, Giuliani finally struck the view that even though he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, he might not literally interpret the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
This is what Mike Huckabee, who found the first place in the Iowa election that was just about to win because of his persistent Christian conservativeism, responded to expectations that the death penalty is painful, but it is necessary.
When it was questioned whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed about Jesus ’ being more wise than he would not go to the elections.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee iowa's acceleration is coinciding with the Liberal Ron Paul's money collecting action and the enthusiastic enthusiasm in the Wednesday debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have so far failed to launch a joint candidate among the best known and more traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000 there was a candidate who joined the party who in time and convincingly harassed the winning message proclaiming America's magnitude and who found the common voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences of this are not yet visible.
Working party pains
Another breakthrough in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current does not seem too thin.
No one has sold his honor, no politicians have found their hotel numbers in Paris, no one has committed an out-of-married scandal.
The discovery, however, that under the name of a rich businessman for more than four years, over 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) had been concealed with the Government of Great Britain and that this party had not reported to one of the things without which Gordon Brown, without being surrounded, would have had a good time.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when he said - that public opinion research did not affect the outcome of the decision - he questioned unreasonably the British intellectual ability, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Deputy Head of Liberal Democrats, who is becoming more and more inspiring, once became Mr. Bean from Brown Stalin.
The left step to rescue the bank called Northern Rock has crossed the regulatory weaknesses and the deficiencies of judgment.
Patient proposals to change the tax law encouraged business stakeholders to join the government.
The loss of the personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities has unprecedentedly revealed a high degree of administrative inconsistency.
In the House of Lords, three resilient generals were hosted to protest against reducing the budget of the army, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time occupation.
And here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labour Party (formerly the administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and do not trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their infidelity.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is likely to be unsuitable for a long time, and perhaps it will not remain on the post, the end of the suspended infidelity: the public officials will leak, the Cabinet ministers will be reinforcing, and the press will look after bad news; and the government will begin to defend and will not be able to concentrate.
In some sense, Brown is particularly in a difficult situation, because, contrary to other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as you'd like to give up your relationship with Tony Blair, it was still his right hand.
Problems about Northern Rock and tax records relate, for example, to decisions taken at the time of Brown's Ministry of Finance.
And even though the prolonged investigation of the relationship between Blair's misleadings, such as the 'money nobility' and political party financing, has not taken part directly, voters can assume that is the opposite of the right.
Although Brown's situation is very uncomfortable, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The bail shots made aren't as scary as they are indicated by the turkeys.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation - whatever pain - can lead to the creation of the directions promised by Stalin living in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, there is a loneliness around political donation.
The believer Abrahams of Garboian, who compares his donations to charity, stated that he did not want his charity to be made public.
Perhaps it is, but the decision was not his authority.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the people have the right to know who knocks on the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about the action of Abrahams, was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interviews; just as Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was aware of the confusing donations in October.
Brown, however, has not yet been led by the drums: there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, even that the huge amounts had been paid to the Brown office after June.
Until now, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
However, the violation of his party was convicted early, but it diluted its firmness to reach a familiar instrument; the investigation of the case, in the interests of safety, was commissioned by a committee chaired by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "learning lesson" is not very complicated.
In the event of an infringement, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to take care of other things, such as the appointment of the President of the independent Committee on Administrative Rules, which has not been chaired for six months, or the prior renegotiation of the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require cooperation from the hard fishermen's Labour Party with the torso and breaking up with special financial relations with the associations - that would be a tough wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some of the facts about the party.
According to the surveys, conservatives are currently leading to a serious advantage; Brown has two years to reintroduce the voters behind himself; the only way to make the victory is inevitable integrity and strong competency.
Card sharks
Does the second market mortgage market crisis threaten America's credit card market?
When blood comes into the water, it's natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage credit crisis is contaminating other forms of public credit, the loss of the credit card market can reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the deferral rate for the ratio of undrawn loans and the default rate for late payments beyond 30 days has risen.
HSBC reported $1.4 billion losses in the US consumer financing segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of card owners.
At the same time, the panic is still early.
The ratio of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is lower than a total percentage point in the historical average.
The reduction in figures can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the American rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden reduction in the number of insolvency reporting agents, while causing large losses on the market of credit cards; the rise in the number of bankruptcy claims (and this representation rate) is expected, irrespective of whether the conditions for borrowing are all deteriorated or not.
The payment rate, which shows the proportion of the monthly cancellation of consumers, is also strong on the market.
Moreover, the confidence in securities covered by the credit card is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney at the Tower Group's research company estimates that the 2007 emission volume will be 25% higher than last year.
Signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers increase debt on credit cards to settle housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers are primarily looking at the movement of money and not the asset value, and therefore the fall in their housing does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of creditors.
The situation that has arisen may even benefit creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to cancel the loan will be reduced, resulting in the repayment of debts on credit cards will take precedence over the priority line.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexible than mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden reflow of assets.
"It is unlikely that one day we will wake up to fully re-evaluate the loans" says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If the decline in housing market prices and the fall in credit are brought to a recession in America, the industry is undoubtedly facing a messy future.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers have declared themselves guilty in the Enron case.
On Wednesday, he confessed to the three British bankers who were brought before the court to investigate their role in a fraud in the name of Enron's former financial director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, were initially declared innocent in the accusation of a weekly fraud that they were supposed to cooperate with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000, seeking to engaging at the expense of their employer.
Their trial started in January.
However, in a court hearing, the American District Judge, before Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them admitted their sinfulness in the same order.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest have become known during the two-year release procedure in Great Britain.
The closure of the investigation of the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 was still awaiting you in the United States.
In 2002, the first prosecution against them warned Fastow that he was one of the targets for the government investigation to investigate Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers crossed "NatWest Trinity" were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare cheating with Michael Kopper, who was Fastow and Fastow's right hand at that time.
Fastow, responsible for the design of numerous frauds confiscating Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's share of the amount of USD 1 million in the subsidiary.
Bankers paid Copper $250,000 to get a share of this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow has falsely informed Enron that the energy company is buying a 20 million dollars subsidiaries from Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, the $20 million were hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charges say the bankers were 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others had reached 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his double guilt for his role in Enron’s collapse.
Three of the British were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently being punished six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper's three years and a month's punishment in a prison in Texas.
Three English men could travel to the United States in the head of bail worth a million dollars, where they were staying during the trial.
Enron, the largest American company ever reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks used for the years could no longer cover millions accumulated as debt or the profitable, but in fact, losses.
Due to the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, the market value is over $60 billion and the value of the pension funds has decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and the former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges imposed on Lay have been resolved by the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
It starts at $54 million a Gulfstream G550 plane equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, which will do the trip between Moscow and Los Angeles without interrupting a tank.
However, for some Russian rich, this amount is only a small amount.
"18 passengers fit in" said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one's ordering so many seats because the machines are purchased for private families or corporate leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive, Millions Customer, which was organized in the huge exhibition halls around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxurious carriages rented a stand at the exhibition, hoping that the Russians would be interested in all new wealthers, from mahogany-covered yachts to 50 cents of diamond-coated refrigerators.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the shiny orange porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it doesn't work after our products" he said.
"Private planes after the United States have the biggest market in Russia."
It seems that the Russian capital is swimming in money as Dallas did at the time of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered to be materialists here."
Like Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japanese gambling players in the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the world's most prettiest poets.
The most exclusive luxuries demand their share of the gold fever.
On another Moscow site, at the conference organised by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH shared his opinion on how to sell high-value products on similar markets to Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of richest people, 53 billion people live in Russia, with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class reaches 103,000, which can afford a total of $670 billion, has established a study by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre analysing personal well-being in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank data indicate that in 2005 the number of persons living under the minimum was 15.8 per cent in Russia.)
"Thousands of millions live in Moscow, which is why we are all here" said Nicole Marais, a representative of the London jewelry store, David Morris.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"Everyone of the women has been cared for inevitably, and men are a real treasure mine."
The two real estate market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their customers were held as a millionaire in the evening dress in the halls.
"I watched the cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who's in his twisted-moving unique design dress like he's used to this drive.
The purchase was primarily arranged for new owners, for the brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to visit a cifran decorated place after several hours, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mövenpick ice cream, normal billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund plüss cathodes at the same time.
For average people, the entry fee is €30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr Gijrath, who, with patriotism, placed in the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft stand, in front of a wall-size, decorated, blue-colored copyright of Rembrandt.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the outstanding things."
Indeed, the salesmen here said that the rich Russians have already passed the long-term (based on the Russian standards, this means 10 to 15 years) from the extremist logos to a limited number of brands that would not enter a commercial fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, commissioned by millionaires, and tourists spent their place every day squeezing.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil bed-making company, said that that day, he sold two $70,000 worth of silk, casmyr and cotton with gold coil.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto's sales assistant for the provision of high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $ 170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, the luxury car manufacturer who delivers the individual needs, L.A. Connection president sold three refrigerators to Rolls-Royce Phantom on Sunday afternoon.
The reporters also showed a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which was said to be included in Swarovski's crystals to produce a roulette wheel appearance.
Price of a set of four: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants a picture of his wife's face from a circonium shell, doesn't necessarily use these objects."
"He's gonna keep them in the garage guarding the 30-40 cars."
Despite the wealth of many of the Russian clients, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid increase in real estate prices there.
"Whoever bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is probably already a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper."
"There are more than you think."
Those who weren't millionaires could at least have made the appearance of wealth before the stand of the Russian wealth management company of Alliance Continent.
The company built four phone ears of English style that were accumulated by millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit banknotes to Millions' Customer.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with money, many made photos of themselves on their mobile phones as they flew in the money quartet or just put a few million dollars on their pockets.
"See, everyone in Moscow may feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
They're suspected of surgical malfunction behind a death in New Jersey.
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked like "Only a Little Healthier" restaurant on a flat glass window and saw an ambulance stopping on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Shortly later, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop", said Wednesday, Lord Livingston, one of the inspectors in the restaurant.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo, and she used to work as the head of the Newark Police Director.
The investigation is currently being conducted to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon who has been unauthorized under West Scott Avenue 212.
So far, the authorities have failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests will be available in a few weeks' time will reveal this mysterious death, which has affected the high level of workers in the Newark Police.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known in the department, worked as an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, busy and reliable" - said McCarthy Arroyo on a Wednesday interview on a phone.
"...he was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs Arroyo was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer in Newark, currently working in the Sesipari Products Control Committee, and she left two boys, a 14-year-old and a 11-year-old, and a stepmother.
Eileen Walsh, the prosecutor of Union county, Theodore J. Romankow's spokesperson, stated that the detectives are working on the investigation of whether Mrs. Arroyo was a victim of an unauthorized surgeon.
"After his probability," said Walsh.
"The investigation is currently under way."
The authorities' reports show that they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. November
On the 21st and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
They've already declared dead at the scene.
More than a week ago, and the police have been telling me very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if the detectives had heard Castro.
Participants in the study are investigating whether part of the house was operating as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door at Castro's home, where he was standing in the narrow front and a song barking from the back of the house.
Behind the door to the basement, a blue tank was placed in the car room with "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes rode from hooks to side.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived at Newark after 25 years in the New York Police, Mrs Arroyo gave her an incredible help to identify the new city's unusual and unspeakable political culture.
"He always said, "He'll be better careful with this and that."
"He's always been here when I arrived in the morning, and he was still in when I left tonight.
It was embarrassing."
The expectations for the Fede interest-cutting lead to a global stock market crash.
On both coasts of the Atlantic, the stock prices jumped yesterday after the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank in the United States increased their hope that the Fed would try to facilitate investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
The stock markets in London, both in New York and across Europe, after Donald Kohn, who declared the Fed President Ben Bernanke's right hand, must respond "specificly and pragmaticly" to the unresponsiveness of financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to mitigate the markets in the midst of the signs of the reviving credit crisis, Kohn stated that the current retreat "particularly retarded the development of the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion continues, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital to the US markets to stabilise credit conditions or even further interest reductions.
The statements have also been reluctant to Wall Street, which has recently been understood by a number of bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American housing sales.
In addition, Bear Stearns' investment bank announced its financial resilience that it would provide 4% of its cost reductions as part of 650 employees and global labour forces to compensate for losses in the second-market sector of housing loans in the US.
The above measure concerns a total of 20 jobs in London of 1500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones average industrial index increased by 331 points, 2.55 per cent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 per cent.
The FTSE 100 index of London increased by 165.5 points, by 2.7 per cent at 6.306.2 and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6% and French CAC40 by 2.3%.
The credit market disturbance was renewed after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank has not been seen at a level of 4.7% for the European banks since April 2001.
After the Inglise inter-bank interest rate, Libor reached the highest value since September after the equilibrium of 12 November, 6.59%, the Bank of England was under both greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to grant additional capital to the London Monetary Market.
In England, they demand the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Whose is the British team's 6th pool in Kandy, Owais Shah's or Ravi Bopara's?
And in indirect context with the first test against Sri Lanka is neither less important, who will make the decision?
The latter question is, on the one hand, because David Graveney, chairman of the selections, who is temporarily performing this particular task, provides assistance to coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and, on the other hand, because the branch of the English Executive Director Hugh Morris's desk will be filled with requests to reach the national or at least one-time selection post.
Among the two players draw the shorter, which do not get the sixth hit place, but as known, life, and especially sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell you what makes someone's calling peak, while others can't get through even at a lower level.
It is not just cricket-like that it is difficult to select - often on a subjective basis -.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to see Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two young leaders with smart graduates who know the business are well placed before decision-makers, while only one of them has a place for one of them.
Who can tell you which level is a cricket player without being thrown into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data have a major impact on the decision, but opportunities are equally important.
In a team, the player will have to catch the captain's look at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a hitter will have to get a regular chance to become a big player once.
To catch the look of the constituents is much more complicated.
For example, more than James Anderson has played better in the past season, yet he is a certain team member in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison is in good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson fought 32 first-class gates with a hit and 33 runs to the tour.
Chris Tremlett just hit 29, but both of you have had the most successful moments at the highest level, and they hope they will be like this in the future.
If Shah or Bopara are to play at Asgiriya Stadion, they'll decide on the basis of opinions.
This decision can boost or break anyone's career, but it may also have no special effect on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankán Gareth Batty played all the tests, and with five gates as well as 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood, who then aroused, became a highlighted and decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated, despite the fact that Australia has obtained a double point against Australia.
It is likely that in the Asgiriya Stanion, their conservative instincts in Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will be listened to with greater experience in Shah, against Bopara's young life and dynamics.
There are arguments on both sides.
Shah is next to the four quarters of the 88 bombay test, and he's seven years younger than the 22-year-old Bopara six, who's also in excellent drums, he's 32 first-class hundreds.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah at home in May, in Lorda, ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies, and that Vaughan, who struggled to play again in the next game, hit the immediate resistance of the constituents, seems to have reduced its endurance, which was clearly apparent in Bombay.
Against him, the universal talent of Essex is a happy and unresolved player.
On the cricket track, nothing can be upset, but the behaviour outside the field was well described when the team crashed on a exhibition with a four-wheel drive of the Volkswagen.
Still, the first thing that he did was to take on Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call Alastair Cook's teammate from a distance to ask him, "You saw this?"
He's a better track player with Bopara grades. He's creating a positive drum angle for his smooth medium steps, and his beatings are confident and clever.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of the selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara the chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah'd give a great deal if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he would be the one who plays this weekend.
They're shipping refugees home with buses to work and take the fight with Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived from Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have expired their visas, or in fact those who hope to return to order in the city.
There are some of them who came back to take the fight with the soldiers who were struggling them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan before a 800-person government convoy filled with dozens of buses from Damascus arrived.
"Then I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi's sunny doctor.
"I came back today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army stopped by killing people," he added, referring to Moqtada al-Sadr milicist priest who was currently stopping the skiite army.
The 38-year-old skiite teacher from Amariyah, who lived mostly by the sunny, Qasim al Atwani, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqi people from doing work.
Neighbours of Amariya's ski were phoned and urged to return home, saying, the Americans' support teams managed to extract Al-Qaida from their palace in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sunny and skiit tribe leader who escaped from a grenade attack from the home in Sleikh of the North bagdadi after he began to encourage his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they need support for me and my sons.
That's why I came back today" - said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken about the strengthening of peace since the United States forces were involved in the capital, and the armed civil forces with the Americans have seduced them home.
However, more were forced to return from Damascus due to visas and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-child Salaam Al-Samarrai voiced a widespread view of refugees, according to which the Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian Government to refuse the visa application of refugees to force their return home.
They believe that more than two and a half million people escaped from the death gangs in the country.
"It was all right until Al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government so that it would not issue more visas for Iraqi people in order to move home" said the sunny pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I escaped."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the sunnites were expelled from the ski areas, while the skis also left the Sunita lakta regions, which is why tension was reduced in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees resurfaces the moods, which may lead to further battles.
Small Saarland - Near training
The smallest federal region plays a leading role in vocational training, and its higher education is also an international orientation.
Only in one field of training, the island rural population struggle with the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"On the 50th day, I explained to a non-Saar region that we are not French" - this self-irónic slogan is announced in the posters at the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Arctic Education System, which, on the basis of the surveys of the Cologne German Economic Institute (IW), can be praised by the fifth location.
In this way, the higher education institutions, even because of traditions, work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can complete their studies with a double, even a third degree until today.
Accordingly, 15,6% of you have a higher proportion of foreign students.
However, many of them do not have high-school education in the Saar rural colleges and universities, but they do not have an average attraction to those who want to learn.
"The opportunities for vocational training are exploited in the island," explains Axel Plünnecke, a German Institute of Education.
Young people receive further education at more than five trained schools, which exceeds the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities for vocational and higher education have also been well developed.
Infrastructure for dual studies is a second place within Germany for the population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers still decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the islands therefore called on the institutions of higher education at the heart of engineering sciences to take advantage of marketing power.
"In general schools we have launched a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
To begin learning earlier, the last year of school is free of charge, a model that the other federal provinces have also started copying.
Only future comparative studies will respond to the progressive improvement of students’ performance.
Based on the Pisa survey in 2003, the proportion of students affected by the risk was choked from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the island region has not improved to the extent that the other federal provinces have improved.
The Bajorans count better.
For the highest revenge of the islands during the Pisa Measure, foreign language knowledge should not be taken into account - otherwise, beans could be harvested in this area,
Because the language of the neighbouring countries is a mandatory object in high schools - even if the islands are not French.
Chávez transfers lessons
In Venezuela in the near future, lessons are different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will turn the time meters back in Latin America in half an hour.
In the meantime, Chávez became an object of laughter in Spain.
As told by Venezuela's official paper, the watches are reversed in four and a half hours in comparison to greenwichi's time under a new law.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The United States anti-Chávez has, inter alia, justified its decision to force the whole hours-based time zones into the world.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist of the left said that until the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Government of Colombia, he will remain in contact.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who demands a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country should make an opinion within a referendum on Sunday.
Reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The cause of the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate with the rebels in Colombia on the release of hostages.
Uribe's decision to "arcul spit" Venezuela gave a voice of criticism on Chávez Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile-speaking voice has emerged: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), so sounds like the sentence that has already been filled by more than half a million people from the internet.
The sentence comes from Károly János, the king of Spain, who was so upset at the recent Latin America summit by the permanent intrusions of the populist politician in Balolda, that he cut it in this way.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans
A projection of real wage reductions is expected to threaten German workers this year, despite the strong conjunkcy.
Experts have undermined their pessimistic prediction with lots of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation calculations, employees can actually account for less payments in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general turnover tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn, a member of the Macroeconomic and Consortium Research Institute.
In addition, workers may be undergoing new burdens in the area of unemployment insurance.
Peer Steinbrück, Minister of Finance, stated in his statement to the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, that in the current situation, the right and reasonable reduction of unemployment insurance to 3,3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be brought into a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for loans or support, cited the German Social Democrat Party, the SPD politician.
On Tuesday it became known that the price of food and mineral oil products has resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the total price increased by 3 per cent.
Venus is the twin of the Earth
In spite of the Venus' storm atmosphere, it is more like the Earth than it has been assumed: in the air circle, the European "Venus Express" spacezone lightnings, and the corners have discovered wind twists as they are born on the earth in winter.
Nearly three decades ago, scientists assume that the Venus is lightning.
The European "Venus Express" astronaut has provided evidence - discovered electromagnetic waves in the peripheral of the atmosphere: The lightnings in Venus are spreading from clouds at a height of 56 kilometres from clouds, reports Christpher Russel, a colleague at the University of California of Los angeles.
According to the famous theory, the emergence of the earth’s life was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, the zivatars have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amineic acids, the builders of life.
It's not like Venus: "If ever there was a life there, it could have been in the very early days," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, living organisms can hardly exist on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere on the wheels is 100 times higher than on Earth, and the temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Maybe Venus is the twin brother of the Earth, but still his twin brother," he angled it down with Russell.
The main question of Esa is why Venus is moving in a different development path in the mass and size of the Earth.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research, because since the beginning of the '90s, no probe was on the way to find this planet.
The latest research results described in several of the "Nature" articles are, in the opinion of the researchers, not only the uniqueity of the Venus Solar System.
They also point out that the similarity of the neighbouring planet to Earth is greater than we once assumed," said Esa.
Researchers, alongside the already known North Pole, discovered a much faster moving cloud to the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air flows of the Earth's winter hemisphere, states the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system is almost the same as Earth and almost the size of Earth with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The sky as the Esthajnal star will avoid the sun in just 225 days.
However, he turns slowly around his own tent: a Venus Day takes 243 earthly days.
Although the 460 Celsius-degree surface temperature of Venus 92 bar coupled with pressure hardly reminds the Earth, scientists start from the fact that both planets were created in a completely similar circumstances.
Both of them gathered water that remained on the earth as an ocean while Venus left in the universe.
And while carbon dioxide was bound to carbonate stones on Earth, Venus is a large part of this atmosphere.
Khler protects Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the end of the debate between the parties exploding around the office of the Chancellor of Dalai Lama.
Indirectly, the SPD was criticised for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
Horst Köhler, German President, is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the great coalition to end the debate about the betting of Dalai Lama.
"In this question, we should not show ourselves as a shared nation to the outside world," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
Köhler, at the same time, expressed his understanding that the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) accepted the Dalai Lama in September.
"For me, human rights are universally valid even if I respect the difference between cultures," Chler undertook.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to take care of the foreign policy balance, emphasised the President of the Republic; however, Merkel is defending against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "a Chinese" policy.
China is also aware of this," said Khler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Foreign Minister (SPD), indirectly, gave a voice of reluctantness over the betting of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became the target of attacks in the EU lines.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's 'private policy' in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, there were serious disturbances in the German-China relations.
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL, the German Minister for Finance, not only Peer Steinbrück (SPD), has frozen the so-called Strategic Chamber between the two countries' Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of State, has now called on Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to bet the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the fact that European politicians accept the religious leader of the Tibetans in their official quality, and confirmed the Chinese position Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama have pointed out that they are trying to break up further Tibetan areas that include Tibetan regions and other regions today.
Schäuble is protected from confusions like French people
Street confrontations with the police, shootings, flamming cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects from confusions similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany is not contradicted in street violence, demands the Federal Minister for Interior.
Barricads were burning, dating officers fired with a beer gun on the police: After the serious disturbances of young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) holds similar developments in Germany.
"We need to agree that social explosives do not accumulate and do not squeeze into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said to the Neue Presse newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people are adapted to rapid changes in social reality.
The Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes will be shown."
However, it is too early to relieve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that in the German precincts there are no urban and sociological problems such as France.
In the northern cities of Paris last night, young people fought heavy street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings have burned.
In view of this, the federal government, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the Turkish Communities in Germany, called for more activity in relation to integration.
As regards the confusions in France, Kolat warned me about the dangers of reproduction.
Although the situation in Germany is not as sensitive as France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat indicated that among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "higher than the average".
More educational sites should be provided in front of all.
Kolat emphasised: "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
However, the Head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" in Germany is much more present than in France.
In addition, many young immigrants do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns me, "We have to be latched."
For young people, "the faster you need to give them the opportunity to have work and to receive education".
Meanwhile, in the outskirts of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel had a complete rest during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready for deployment, and a helicopter had a headlight on the ground.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flammable garbage tissues and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of 1,000 people on a wheel has taken care of the peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, after visiting Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior.
In the middle of the Tuesday night, 80 police officers were wounded round by the wilier-le-bel confusion.
The next night, the confusion spread to Toulouse.
The fires have emerged in a transport accident, during which two young people have lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the state attorney, the police are not liable for the death of young people.
Cloud in the Empire of Angela
The fact that the Chancellor's action has been ruined from reality is a proof that the coalition is ending - and nothing is expected of it.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live in?
After its indifferent and unspeakable action in the Bundestag's general debate, it must be established: not here - it does not live in the country whose governance would be up to him.
He rejected the accusation with a very clear sentence by Angela Merkel, saying that he would focus too much on foreign policy.
It's provincial, it's responding, and in this way, it's just saying that you don't want to understand what the critics of him are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how credible the eyes are.
In the meantime, neither specific interest nor empathy were felt for the problems of the country.
Instead, the emergent Cloud Angela: a politician who has been ruined from reality who runs into foreign policy and is only insecurity there.
An example of climate protection: Heligendam is braggingly complimenting himself for the Heligendam authorities, but he listens to how to achieve the climatisation goals in the country.
At all, as far as the self-grate is concerned, such modesty would not have been granted to you two years earlier by the Chairman of CDU.
Now it's getting into the phase that prosperity has a positive effect on humans.
This harms his good news as a pragmatic personality, which provides solutions to problems rather than linguistic flowers.
However, in Angela's precinct, the problems of domestic policy are only ancillary.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
It's just a few words he's saying.
In this respect, it is a great deal of defects when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel's got to move on three times to bring a semi-find-hand phrase together.
If it's concrete, it's botting in an alien area.
Injury case
During the discussion of the Republican candidates on Youtube, the two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have to be held against an outside candidate.
The tension of candidates has already come up with the first topic.
Mitt Romney says to the opponent Rudy Giuliani that he made "a legal immigrant rescue" in New York.
Who, on his own hand, contends with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as asylum for illegal immigrants", cut back Giuliani and throw Massachusetts' former governor's attention to the fact that he was employing immigrants without documents as a private man.
The candidates are going to attack: Since the Republican camp still has no uniformly supported favor, the eight presidents use the debate on the CNN before all of them to undermine the lending of the opponent.
The Internet users sent their own 30-second videos via Youtube are hardly more than short summaries.
"We have brought Hitler to power with this type of isolacionism", he rubs John McCain under his opponent, Ron Paul, who demands immediate exit from Iraq as the only of the participants in the circle.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washing Vietnam on a veteran, when he's struggling to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", the interrogation method in which he's simulating water congestion.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are beyond the debates on Iraq and torture, it is shown to the people of St. Petersburg in Florida.
There is a loud tap in the room when the conservative values are praised and the future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more visible.
"I was mistaken", Romney repents and apologizes to the supporters and TV viewers because in 1994, he dropped the voxes at the break of pregnancy.
Giuliani, in turn, asks for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first ruled as civilians
One day after the retreat of the army, Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, was extinct.
It ends eight years of military reign in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, took place on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the Islamic Abad presidential palace from the capital.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act for the benefit of his people.
Wednesday's military management office was given to his confidentiality, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed everyone to face the international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after the former general has gone to power in military form without bloodshed, he is now the first ruler of civilian state.
Musharraf, with his return as chief commander of armed forces, has complied with a fundamental demand for the West and the opposition.
Further important demand for the eradication of the exceptional condition, published by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to the DG Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the exceptional condition in which he further claims the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, on the beginning of November following the publication of the exceptional state, has put in place sympathizing lawyers, has rejected all the objections to the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the tribe area in the north, in Northern Vaziristan, he was killed by five soldiers and was injured by four more.
According to the information reported by the spokesman of the army, the bomb was exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The fathers of Krautrock return
The seventies German super team again musically: Harmonia's three gang members rediscovered the instrument of a Berlin concert to the power of a concert.
At the time of the reconciliation, a cut tape will be displayed from the time of their lightning, from the time of "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more familiar abroad.
The notified sensation is a body killed by three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
In front of each of them, your own instrument, your own cable, and in front of everything, your own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snowy shirt for 63 years.
Michael Rother, from the left to 57 years of age, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius focuses on the console from the audience.
Each one of them produces some kind of noise, and one-time rhythm.
And sometimes it's like a coincidence of traditional music.
However, this does not seem to disturb the troops themselves.
It was a great excitement for the crautrock music guides that the Harmonia band was relaunched with music.
What we can tell you here is that as a result of a proper follow-up, we can find that the name went through the collective pop memo, but in no case left any lasting traces of this band to be painfully missing after 32 years.
But why shouldn't I celebrate the legends of the Germans of their seventy years?
Especially that what we call Krautrock in England and America have always been valued more than in their own country.
When the music industry, the Cologne Can, was awarded the Echo Awards for Life in 2003, the German pop shapes were sitting in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When even La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked the Red Hot Chili Peppers for their lauding, the admiration became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat in the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is already overloaded by Harmonia because the trio has existed for only two years, and this time, it has had less effect than others have subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play art with Conrad Schnitzler under the much promiseing Cluster.
At first, they played at Schaubühne, Berlin, under the theatre.
Then, in Düsseldorf, a record company funded by the church, from economic considerations.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, the most radical German gang, Neu, has acquired a reputation as a guitar.
During 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster to their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom as a escaped commier.
Less ideologized than in Communist I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic art.
According to the garbage, Harmonia Ottenstein's songbird was found and thus found a name as their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and next is "De Luxe".
Despite the cool and modest music, the band suffered material need.
Collecting storms alone did not guarantee the finding of themselves.
The CD appeared on "Live 1974" was picked up at a concert in Griessem, in front of an audience with a shortly 50 people records, so someone remembers.
Harmonia's push and occasional practice at that time was Rother's idea.
To Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its breakdown in 1975.
Rother ended up with the Ezoteric and held himself up from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the eighteen years, which has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album of Grayschem is due to Herbert Greenemeyer.
His record company listening to Greenland aimed at caring for the Krautrock as a special German food in live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug up the same way as Roedelius' solowork.
Harmonia will be raised in the Berlin Culture House.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British ancestry and the Krautrock Sampler is also present.
There's also the Loveparade's idea manager, Dr. Motte.
All of this is about to show the impact of krautrock on the following pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills out the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding, with the most unusual voices, is floating in the room: "The only true music, he owns the future."
There are pictures that describe the producer with Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The screening of further black and white photographs of hollow cabled equipment serves the design of legends.
In the front room, the three veterans are reproducing improvisation.
This only means that microphones are recorded in the Orgona and drum equipment with the intention of dismantling voice effects from the instruments themselves, using the instruments that produce sound effects.
Today, electric music seems to be an electric music.
Three, he's in a tech.
All this clock doesn't even change anything.
During Barbara Morgenstern's leadership, they cough and rifle, and in a beautiful part they sing "Aaaaaaaah!"
The Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in the escape of musical colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the way of art and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone screams "'68" here, he's not on the wrong road, and Harmonia doesn't even leave you out of it.
Even the most perceptive thing of yourself is carefully considered on the stage.
Where does the music begin, and where does it end?
It can neuronize a man or give him the moments of extraordinary happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
By means of the "Watch" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films are repeatedly engaged in the Balkans war.
But none of them are convincing.
The main point is to action and shooting, or it's too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help you with this in "Fighting."
First of all, the good news is: Although the two war criminals, Karadzsics and Mladics are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, they found him again in the dark back of the Bosnian war, Richard Gere.
Recently, we lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighteen years, as many of the good-boy roles played in emotional films for women and many press conferences on the buddhism issue even made us feel like to look at it.
And, look, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument that we might still look at the "Fathering" movie.
It provides a wonderful, smilesome design: Basically, the Simon Hunt Warrior that he has formed is exactly what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry weren't such a grace: a man who left behind his finest years long ago, but the fall in his ruinous monuments still preserved a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the film "Warning" and also the production of German "Mörderischer Frieden" this week continues only to the end of the failed films on the Balkans war.
We don't have much to say to "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) who save a Serbian woman from the shooters in Kosovo, and one of them likes it all of a sudden.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbians are not depicted as all the bad only causes, the film bearing the sensitivity of television films is too quickly lost in shooting and eventful scenes.
He's wearing a "Cobra 11" sign with war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, it is exemplary in the case of "Fadelism", why, in fact, no really good film of the Balkans war has been produced.
The story of the three US warriors who are approaching to searching for the Serbian war criminal who listened to the name "Roka", other directors, other scriptwriters (in both Richard Shepard's Perszonal Union) in another age might have become a new "Apocalypse now".
Because stories show surprising similarities: in both cases, small groups are throwing him into the forest to carry out what the army is unable to do, and in both cases, the journey to go crazy.
One of the reasons for the fall of the "Waying" is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt be a twisted cynical listener to his heart as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and in addition, in the script, he spent a romantic relationship with a woman who was murdered later in Muslim Boss.
The "Water" will slip away in the end when the reporters reach in the form of accelerated recording in the last five minutes of the film, what Nato, the CIA and all the world's headhunters couldn't in five years: the warrior sinner will be handed over to the Mohamedan bosoms for fair revenge.
It's so bad that a person would prefer to go to the Hague International Court of Justice for the crime committed against the cinema's logic.
The goal of the film is deeply human.
He intends to point out that Karadzsics and Mladics are still on the loose and he suspects the Americans and the French (almost allegedly even unified) that the secret political agreements do not lead to persecution intensively.
But good and evil sometimes look so much like each other that a famous Brecht is in mind.
This poet writes the following about the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I am staring at the peak of the dive, which tells me how boring it is to be."
The films like "Fashing" have the same over-size masks of human head, which, however, show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the genre of the films on the Balkans war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all the films about Hollywood, Iraq were ugly.
We can add: No good movies from South Africa have yet.
It's almost always valid: If a star is traveling in the world's crises or minefields, it's like "The paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "without power" with Angelina Jolie or "The Bloody Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are still too close to time.
They had to spend decades while Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the holocaust with the "Schindler List" film.
Some movies are probably still available - as the films about the Vietnam War, which are now considered classic, such as "The Horsehunter", "The Apocalypse now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated in their time as a unanimous masterpiece.
But it can be imagined that nowadays, when each mass murder comes to our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the scriptwriters of ignoring the reality that they need to tell good stories.
Because the "Lenni or not" or "The dictator" were finally so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do the right thing if you're trying to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to place the novel Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When the historic novel of "Lemprière-Lexikon" and the parallels between the Balkans war, he said, "This is all that depends on the fact that certain things never change.
The cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is highly criticised for resigning the Olympics
The decision of the mayor to organise the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has led to a rigorous criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue fighting to organise water games.
Von Beus, however, warns realities vigorously during the odds.
On Wednesday, the General Executive Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the retreat as unfavourable for the economic environment.
No other project has released such huge motivation forces in the city recently as the Olympic idea.
Without this objective, we could not maintain a level playing field in sports policy.
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop such a long-term initiative, "that will start from the modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his previous statements that his ambitions for Hamburg Olympic games were not realistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg's decision on the Olympics, it's the German Olympic Sports Association," said von Beus to WELT ONLINE.
In the beginning of December, the Council of Sports was waiting for a decision on the München proposal for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"That preference for us means that we have no real chance in the period until 2028."
However, we don't give up the dream forever, said von Beus.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over von Beus' statements.
This makes the impression that Hamburg is not intending to apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to sneak a chance to bury our plans now," said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the retreat is contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate at the General German College Sports Association.
At that point, the 2015 Univerziádé offer of Von Beust Hamburg was described as not a replacement for Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association has only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the tender in the last week.
The civilian group of SPD called on the Senate to leave a valuable time for the construction of the apartment in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed for years because he was standing next to the Olympics and has ignored the building of the apartment," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break the chain alongside the integrated plan of the Olympic and later purpose of housing for the Kleiner Grasbrook, CDU put the focus on the "verse factor".
The tender for Summer Olympic Games submitted in 2012 triggered great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But he failed on Hamburg Lipcsé.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wallpaper to the Ike, and not Andy Warhol.
Or are you?
Currently, the walls made in Sweden put dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
The majority of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box is fake.
After a few months ago, the Swedish "Expressen" page questioned the originality of the Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol in 1968, the inner investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet has come to an up-to-date conclusion: The Pontus Hultén, former museum director, who was donated to Moderna Museet in 1995, is also a large part of the six "Brillo Box" copies donated to Moderna Museet - and is likely to be a hundred more "Stockholm-type" wheels on the international art market.
The history is a chain of long and complicated, artistic and governoral stunts confusion.
Warhol formed the first "Brillo Boxait" in New York in the paperboard box of "Brillo" soap powder painted walls based on red-blue-white formater.
In a exhibition in Moderna Museet in 1968, hundreds of Brillo boxes were made from a carton with Warhol's consent: they were not from Warhol (cost savings), but were transported directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It wasn't about artwork, it was about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
However, in 1968 Warhol authorised some Brillo-walls to be produced in Sweden, but not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the title "Stockholm" were entitled to the history of art and auction.
Some of them were auctioned for over $10,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum manager, falsely stated that in 1968, hundreds of walls were produced and produced in Sweden, which were then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were manufactured in Malmö only in 1990 for a Saint-Petervár exhibition.
But at this time Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main artist of Moderna Museet, has also examined three boxes of private Swedish owned by the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed roller sheets were first stacked and squeezed, followed by white oil paints.
Conversely, the structure of copies from 1990 reveals that the paint was directly placed on the rollboard, without any foundation, not even on oil, but on the acrylesters.
"They were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If not otherwise decided by the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board', the Moderna Museet will be classified as a copy/exhibiting material."
The Board of Justice, of course, already announced in June that it would follow up on the soap-powdered boxes to be "serious accusations".
Since then, however, they have been hiding in unwanted silence.
Manilai rebel soldiers give up
In the Philippines, the soldiers who baricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila were rebelling and demanding the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
You can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, report reporters at our hotel leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Prior to this, government-guided soldiers crawled the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricading in the building for hours.
Half of the team stood before court on Thursday due to the failure in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve wheels with 30 sympathetics.
The military police in charge of the man's guard obviously stepped over and joined the envoy.
They entered Peninsula-Hotel, then Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's failure was demanded.
Governor's units have closed the area of the prestigious hotel.
The president called the Security Office to an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales Security Advisor convicted the military's prosecution.
"They're enough for people," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly Commander of Scout Rangers, announced that other military units wanted to join the race in a short time.
The government critics were calling for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been devastated by corruption charges for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main stage in 2003 for the attempt to enthrone against Arroyo, organised by 200 members of the army.
The uprising failed just 24 hours ago when the army was forced to join.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been carried out against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will be large-scale in the Versatel
United Internet has provided over 20 percent share in Versatel telecommunication.
As the company announced Wednesday night, the average price per share is EUR 14,46.
This capital represents 20,05 % ownership.
Before that, they've had a wing of opinion on the reception.
The possibility of increasing the ownership acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, the German DSL market is being consolidated, reported United Internet.
Before this, there were presumptions of a possible connection on Wednesday after the Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf Network Service Provider by another 5% to 15,1%.
The financial institution holds its share only as a third party, it is known on the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet already owned 10 percent of Drillisch's mobile phone company.
Within the framework of capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares in EUR 106.4 million.
