The members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves at the Muppet Show
Some of the members of the National Assembly were despised by the proposal to change their address to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MEP in Wales).
The alarm was attacked after it emerged, the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title can be the subject of laughter.
According to one of the working parties, the group is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for our readers in the Wolesan language, the twp is a single agent, and the pwp is a cock.
According to one of the Members of the Plaid Party, the entire group is "unhappy" and therefore suggests alternatives.
One of the conservatives said that his group was "open" for the name change, but he noted that the MWP was only a jump from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in the wales language, the letter “w” is dropped in the same way as “u” in the yorkshire English, i.e. the MWP outlined “map”.
The opinion of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft statute of the name change is as follows: "The final decision on the titles for the appointment of the members of the Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the representatives."
The 2017 Law governing Wales allowed the name of the Wales National Assembly to be changed.
The Commission published in June the results of the public consultation, which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the title of the Members, the Commission prefers the title of Mr Welsh (Member of the Wales Parliament) and the abbreviation of the WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
MEPs have new and new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who has to submit a proposal for a law on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including the discrimination of Members and the Commission's structures.
Members may, on their own address, make their final vocabulary during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia will hold a referendum on the change of the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the ‘North-Macedonia Republic’.
The purpose of the referendum is to put a point at the end of a decades of debate with neighbouring Greece, which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long been advocating that, with its name, its northern neighbour, it is essential to raise a territorial need and has repeatedly challenged its request for EU and NATO takeover.
President Gjorge Ivanov Macedón is opposed to the referendum on name change and therefore does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is simply a compromise that must be made for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The harlem churches are in a difficult situation, and the bells of St. Martin have been silenced.
“Admerly, as I heard from older people, there was a bar and a church in every corner,” says Adams.
"No one today."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would even be understandable.
“ People are in different ways nowadays, ” she says.
– Bars are no longer the social days that people end every day."
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams fear that the sale of the church property does not replace the leaders’ hopes, “and they will be kept back in the same place where they started. ”
And the place of the churches, including, will be built in residential buildings, whose community of residence also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white – and this will speed up the final closure of churches, as most of those who move in these apartments are unlikely to join the community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew up into a black town – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin, a decade later.
The original white metodist congregation moved out of the temple in the 30s,
which was then taken into possession by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin’s church was taken over by Reverend John Howard Johnson’s black congregation – the reverend is the Harlemi shopping street, the 125th street is the black or black products are not known to be marketed against the owners of the business.
In 1939 a fire crash caused serious damage in the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order the Reverend Johnson led the community.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and the successor of St. Martin Peninsula, proud of the bells of the poor.
According to the bell game expert in July, this bell game is a "cultural heritage", "an unreplaceable, historically important instrument".
The expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who was in contact with the bigger bell game of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, the St. Martin hasn't signed anyone in place.
In St. Martin, over the past few months, a complex situation has been broken out with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who were partly engaged by the world leadership of the church, partly by the bishop office.
The Governing Board of the Parotics, the Council of the Church, in July, asked the Bishop's office in writing, refusing that the Office would ‘remove the costs’ to the council when the Council did not participate in the selection of the architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the Office.
Some members of the community complain in the absence of transparency at the house of the office.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California during cancer death.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during cancer death on the opening day of the Cancer season, on Saturday in California.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB channel in San Diego told me that he and his friends were floating about half an hour ago, when he was aware of a boy crying out for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit!
He bit me!"
“The shoulder was torn off at the key bone, ” he added Hammel what he saw when he came to the boy.
– I started yelling to get everybody out of the water: “There is shark in the water” he said.
The boy was transported with an ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where they are currently treating him in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy are unknown.
As Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier shark has been detected in the area, but it was found that it was not one of the species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy had traumatic injuries on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time and safety reasons of the investigation.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's would expand on the British Beauty Market
The Sainsbury's expert would take up the competition with sales and large-scale piperestands with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the meantime, the decline in sales of fashion and household articles is constantly rising in the UK’s beauty care market, which is 2.8 billion pounds, and they will also appear in new stores from the next year.
Strengthening the pipeline is due to the fact that the stores try to fill the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household articles in different ways.
The Sainsbury's said that it would double it, i.e. add its offer to 3,000 products, including the representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which is now offered for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be placed in a larger area in brand-specific stands such as Boots and similar stores for customers.
The store chain also reinitiates the Boutique make-up family in which most of the products are now vegan, because there are more and more young customers looking for them today.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume trafficker also tested the appearance of two Sainsbury's stores, one of which has already been opened in Croydon last week in the southern part of London, while the other year is open in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
By spreading online purchases and redirecting food shopping habits to small local trade, large companies should make greater efforts to cheat buyers.
According to Director-General of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the offer will be more and more similar to mixed trade, as the chain of commerce is trying to increase competition with discontained shops such as Aldi and Lidl, in addition to food.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, Sainsbury's hundreds of stores opened Argos classes and some of the Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition proves to be even more profitable.
The chain of commodities failed its previous attempts to sew beauty care and pharmaceutical classes.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's debate with Boots ended up in a joint venture, but the distribution of the revenues of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores.
The new strategy was created after the Sainsbury's three years ago sold its pharmaceutical business in the business of 281 for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who operated Lloyds' paticancle.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will have a role in the strategy, and in four stores it will offer a wider palette of luxurious skin care products with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the director of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by transforming the appearance of our piperestants.
In addition, we have also hired qualified staff who help interested people with advice.
Our brand offer serves all the needs, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide a tempting force that increases the buying experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "attack" after Holly Willoughby quit the 11 million pounds agreement
The star Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, has left the "dembolged" after Holly Willoughby television broadcaster stopped by the 11 million important agreements on the trade in lifestyle products to concentrate on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for a homedress and accessories for Truly's brand.
The two celebrities were compared with the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old show manager announced in Instagram that he would leave.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled the match out of the Dragons’ star Peter Jones, when it came out of a promising, lifestyle product-marketing company in the last moment – to focus on its very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to certain sources, Jones announced during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, which amounted to a total of 1,5 million pounds, would no longer have enough time for their common brand, which would be distributed to Truly.
The two celebrities were compared with the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets to GBP 11 million.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram to leave Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his holidays.
One source says: “ Truly was far from the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long term, and this will give him his life in the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
He surprised everyone about what happened on Tuesday, because the departure was so close.
In Marlow's office, the warehouse is full of the goods to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars of this Morning programme managers in Great Britain could cost the company millions thanks to the stacks and possible slippings invested in stacks and home clothing.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child show manager and husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby launched Truly with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the Presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product arc and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm Celebrity programme.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We do not want to comment on [Jones] business.
They said tough words, "then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms of the press for his statement, which some might think to be "unprisoned" and for what he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump let so much?
– asked Trump in a funny "screaming" voice.
"I didn't let anyone."
As he noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time, after the first session in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed him as a huge step towards the nuclear weapons of North Korea.
However, agreements on nuclear weapons have been undermined.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, on Saturday, on the North Korea representative Ri Jongho announced to the UN General Assembly that, as its country sees, the United States did not receive a “appropriate response” for the early arms of North Korea.
Instead, as stated, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump was more optimistic in a campaign speech.
“It's going well with North Korea, ” he said.
– We were supposed to war with them.
Millions of people would've lost it.
Now there's a very good relationship between us."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have made positive results – the completion of the missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was talking about his relationship with Kim in such an unusual way.
“It is not hard to behave first, but there is not a ten thousand people out there trying to get in, but only two hundred people are here before me,” said Trump pointed out to the group ahead.
In Indonesia there are hundreds of dead men in the tsunami and earthquake that turns the island.
Indonesia also rejected the help of international aid organisations after the earthquake in Lomboki.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomb's population had to be deployed, there was no reported disaster at national level, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, it was very clear that there was no need for international assistance and that is why our situation was a little difficult,” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working to set up a rescue team that can be sent to Paluba, but it is not yet sure that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescues on the ground.
Sutopo, the spokesman of the National Anti-Fraud Office, says that Indonesian offices are currently carrying out an assessment of the palu situation to see if it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating power of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in the Province of Aceh, it is not at all common in other coastal areas.
The same tsunami signal was in place, and the apparent lack of the tsunami signal system in Palu has also contributed to the emergence of a catastrophe that requires human life.
Transport in the Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best time.
During natural disasters logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship in Lombi is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it arrives at the disaster affected zone.
Joko Widodo placed the development of the stunning infrastructure of Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and did not save costs in road and rail projects.
However, before next year's elections, the Joko Government is facing budgetary deficits.
In addition, the President must face the conservative tensions in Indonesia, since the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1000 people had to die and ten thousand had to be set up because of the confusions that led to Christian and Muslim bands with boiling belts, bows, arrows, and other heated weapons on the streets.
Video: Daniel Sturridge's liverpool giant equation target against Chelsea
At the Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with the goal of kicking the Premier League in 89 minutes, who didn't lose against Chelsea.
The team was lost from 0 to 1 when Sturridge was given about 30 metres from the gate of Chelsea to Xherdan Shaqiri.
He put the ball on the left, then started a huge kick in the remote corner of the gate.
The shot crossed high over the sixteen and went towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally got into the net above the floating Kepa Arrizabaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there is always someone like Shaq, who plays the ball forward, so I tried to make myself better,” Sturridge replied to the LiverpoolFC.com question.
"I saw Kante coming, and I just took her off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot her."
Chelsea leads to 1 to 0 in the semi-time after the Belgian star player, Eden Hazard, acquired leadership in 25 minutes.
The blue battle cornered Mateo Kovačič to pass the ball, then managed to break off the middle track and run into the Liverpool square.
Kovačič started and got the ball back on the middle track after a quick injection.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful gift towards the 16th.
Hazard ran the protection and finally sent the ball to the remote corner of the Liverpool gate next to Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool meets Napoli on Wednesday at 3:00 a.m. at the Stadio San Paolo Arena of Napoly.
Chelsea plays against the Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in UEFA Europe.
832 victims of Indonesian tsunami.
The number of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, reported by the local Anti-Fraud Office on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 strong earthquake on Friday and the 6-metre high storm waves that followed it, several people were buried under the ruins, reported by the Agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of Palu with more than 380 thousand souls are covered by the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
The police suspected a 32-year-old man arrested a murder in the stabbed woman's case.
The police started a homicide investigation after a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's corpse was found at 7:55 this morning at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested suspected of murder.
The police are asking for the residents in the area to report to anyone who has seen or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still in early stages, however, I ask everyone who stayed in Birkenhead near John Street, and he may have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, in particular the taxi drivers, to find us, who may have anything on board on board, because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
The spokesman of the police confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends came to the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are reporting the victim's relatives to date.
One of the cab drivers in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told me that no one can enter the building at the moment, and no one can leave.
When he found out what happened, the man couldn't speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it can take more hours to get into the building again.
One of the cops told someone that the entire building was currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
"This is terrible" – repeated.
At 2:00 a.m., two police microbuss stayed within the coronal and one more outside.
Within the time, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information should write a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on an unnamed phone number 0800 555 111 and refer to the file of 30 September 247.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell is the latest victim of the rewriting fever in history.
The exile of the statue could be a poetry justice because Cromwell and his followers of the fanatic puritan were then destroying the cultural and church heritage of England with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "bollocks", a "true to rewrite history".
According to the Cromwell Society president John Goldsmith, “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current debates on the removal of statues.
During the British civil war, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell could be victimized for the actions of Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell illustration reflects the opinion of the XIXth century and sets a memorial for a historical character that has to be celebrated today."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less than in the late 19th century, but many of them consider it to be the defendant of external pressure, which was of course the monarchy for him.
The fact that this picture is really precise continues to be the subject of a historic debate.
However, so much is sure that in the middle of the 16th century, this controversy has had an effect on the further development of our nation’s fate, and Cromwell is a identifyable person representing one of the sides of this conflict.
And the results achieved as Lord's Protector should be celebrated and remembered."
Killing pig wounded a Chinese farmer
According to the local press reports, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
His last name was only a man identified as Yuan, covered with blood, a rising beating was found next to a pig in the city of Kujcsou on the city of Liupanshui, reported the case on the Sunday of South China Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer is about to be vaccinated with a vaccine of pigs in a farm in Xining, China, in the province of Chicken.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found a man's body and discovered that his neighbouring pig's door was open.
He said that the mouth of the giant candle in the pig was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation found out that the 250-pound pig is indeed the farmer's death.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and broken,” said Guiyang Evening News only the relative mentioned as Wu.
According to the security cameras, Yuan stepped into the pig at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't own Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was sealed so that others had no harm while the police were investigating the tracks at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although it is not often, there have been reports before when pigs attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in massachusetts and caused life-threatening injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales strangled a farmer to the tractor until the man's wife was able to alarm him.
After a farmer in Oregon in 2012, their own pigs were fed, a master in Manitoba spoke in the CBC News that pigs usually do not tend to attack, but the taste of blood may become aggressive.
“They are very players.
Like the little kids, they're very interesting... they don't want to hurt you.
All you have to do is give them respect," he said.

Rosa struck him as a category 1 hurricane, with a speed of 140 km/h, on Sunday at 5 a.m., from Punta Eugenia in Mexico to 620 km southwest.
The hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low air pressure zone is formed above the Pacific and is heading west towards the Western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches to Alasó-California on Monday, it is flooding the southern regions of the United States as a tropical storm with heavy tropical mass.
The storm may bring up to 25 cm of rain on each territory of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical couple of approaching low pressure masses will cause intense rainfalls in the coming days in the southwest.
The 3 to 10 cm rain could cause sudden floods, floods filled with fractions, landfalls in the desert.
The heavy tropical couple can also bring 5 to 8 cm precipitation per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest there are 5 to 10 cm precipitation in certain parts, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur, with rapid decreasing strength due to the spray character of tropical rains.
In the time of tropical rains, it is not especially recommended to walk in the desert.
Because of the serious rainfalls, canyons can become stunning rivers, and the bulbs are accompanied by sudden windfalls and clouds.
The nearing low pressure masses can cause serious rainfall on the coast of South California.
It's possible to have a 1,5 cm precipitation, which could cause smaller floods filled with fractions and flat roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Soft tropical sodas can appear in Arizona on Sunday nights and Monday morning, then on Monday and Tuesday on a wider area of rain.
Serious rain spreads on Tuesday to the Foursaari region and lasts until Wednesday.
Intensive temperature fluctuations in the United States will be observed in October, as the corner pressures cool, but tropicals remain quite warm.
This may also cause drastic temperature differences per place at short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation on Sunday in the middle of the United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are about 10 degrees away from the temperature.
In the next few days, it is expected that even the summer will be warm in larger areas.
In the central and eastern areas of the United States, it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature from the southern part of the Great Sík will occur between 25 and 30 degrees in some parts of the Northwest.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
In six television channels, a total of more than 20 million viewers followed the testimonys of the Supreme Judgeship candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of sexual violence in the eighteen years Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stunt has not resolved, and the broadcasters had to cancel the regular show course due to the last moment's Friday screw: Jeff Flake's Arizona Senator managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that he was 100% certain that at that time at a high school party Kavanaugh tried to hang him out.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that 100 percent of them are sure that this hasn't happened.
The statements were probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen was calculated by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen can hardly measure the number of people who are watching the shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, it's the only viewer he's used to be a football player or Oscar awarder.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel viewers who promoted the appointment of Kavanaugh from all the channels were the highest, on average, 5,69 million viewers during the whole day hearing.
Second place, the ABC stands with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
Interest didn't decrease after the hearing.
The main role in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the senator of the moderate Republican office issued the statement that Senator Kavanaugh puts the vox down the vox on the CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as the voice mass of the demonstrators receives as he sees on his way to the meeting of the Tribunal Committee.
For a few minutes, he was a spectacle while the crowd was assembled, and the CNN was transmitting the scene in live broadcast.
“I stand in front of you, ” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the public of the country?"
Others shouted: “You have the power to do what you do not for so many women. ”
Flake only said that his office issued a statement, and then added that he would share his speech at the hearing of the Commission before the lift door closed.
The cable and broadcasting channels were visible in live hours later, as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh was to be elected to the full senate.
However, Flake said that he would only be willing to do this if the FBI investigated the prosecutions against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority were demanded.
Flake has been convinced of its need for discussions with her friend Chris Coons, Democrat Senator.
Flake decided on discussions with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was correctly exercised, as it was evident that, without the investigation, the Republicans will not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump started an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.

The police confronted Catalan Separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona, after the independence protesters hit the police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations during the first anniversary of the Catalanian referendum.
A group of separatists with eggs and paint powder threw them with reluctant seizure officers, so the streets that were squeezed with tourists were now covered by dense powder.
In the later part of the day, there were further fights during which the police tried to maintain the order with a rubberbot.
The "We don't forget, we won't forgive" slogans of independence groups and the unit demonstrators behind the "Living Spain" slogan were facing each other for hours.
According to the local press reports, 14 people have been killed with minor injuries during the demonstrations.
The tension will not continue to fall on the referendum of 1 October of the Catalan Separatists, which was considered to be illegal in the region of independence.
The voters voted with a vast majority in favour of the breakdown, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unionists voted against.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote in voting positions with aggressive conflicts.
The independence groups were on the street all night on Friday to prevent demonstration supporting the national police.
Although it has not been prevented, the demonstration was finally not on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participates in the separatist demonstrations, says that there is no longer a chance of gaining independence.
“One of the best times of our life.
I saw my parents throwing tears of joy for which we can vote, but now our case is down," he said.
Although a significant victory has been achieved in the regional elections last December, even if it is limited, the Catalan Party Party of Independence will be difficult to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most known leaders have joined in voluntary exiles or are expected to take a decision by the Court in order to organise the referendum and subsequently express independence.
According to 42-year-old car engineer, Joan Puig, the conflict was fired on both sides by politicians.
"The situation is more tense than ever", she says.
One of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who have been waiting for prior arrest since last year, has announced that he will go to the European Parliament elections next year.
“I can reject the devalvation of democratic values and the oppression that the Spanish government is representing if I participate as candidates in the European elections,” she said.

With Menga's goal, Livingston hit the Rangers team from 1 to 0
Dolly Menga's first goal was to secure Livingston's victory.
The first class has recently reached Livingston caused a big surprise to the Rangers team by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working for 18 games since the Ibrox Club Coach.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference, as Gary Holt's team went to the death competition with the Hibernian team in the second place.
Therefore, Gerrards continued to have no foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they are facing the Hearts team, which is the first place, compared to eight points behind.
Before the Rangers, however, there is still a match on Thursday in Europe's state against Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his division incompetence series to six wins, which means that he hasn't gotten Kenny Miller with the team in the last month.
Livingston has lost a number of situations against the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could've gotten the lead right before the only goal in the game, because they've caused Rangers a few problems with their assault games.
Scott Robinson broke through the same opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempts proved to be wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball crossed before the goal line.
The domestic team let the Rangers play his own game because they were certain that they could disturb the guests in the fixed playing situations.
The destiny goal was born precisely from a situation like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who found this in the middle of sixteen.
During this stage of the game, the Rangers led in the sphere, but domestic protection continued to be unbreakable, while Liam Kelly's gates were scarcely compromised.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for the only situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt on the Rangers Capus, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost the gate from another free kick in Livingston.
The cross-directional balls continued to come to Livingston's sixteenth, but the defenders have been transferred every time. The assault team has not received two criminals: one Halkett's entrance to Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other for handing.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni from Aréna is a reporter of Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland
Livingston has provided phenomenal performance and has swept the beans.
Players played excellently from one to one, and overlooked expectations.
The members of the team and the style of the game have barely changed since they have returned to the line, but Holt's efforts are also worthy of serious recognition, since the coach has arrived, and he has very encouraged the team.
Several players also brought the most excellent form.
Halkett team captain has formed a vast form of greatly organized protection, and Menga has a proper stimulation of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without a clue.
As good as they are at times under Gerrard's leadership, they just couldn't bring that level.
The last shot has always been missing from the formula, but it has only been possible to break home protection, so Rangers need to get together quickly, as they have slipped back into the field.
In Cologne, Erdo
He described the morning meeting of the Turkish and German leaders on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of the visit to the German Republic, which was the goal of improving the link between NATO countries.
The relationship between the two countries has been deteriorated due to human rights, press freedom and Turkey's membership.
After that, Erdo.an traveled to Köln, a newly built, huge mosque opening ceremony.
The town of Köln gives home to the largest community of Turkishs outside Turkey.
On security grounds, the police banned the gathering of the 25 000 people before the mosque, but many of the supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protesters against Erdo
The two opponents of demonstrations are excellent examples of the shared policy of the President, celebrated by certain Turkish German citizens as a hero while others see autocrat in it.

Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured during a confusion
Six prison guards have been injured in a strictly guarded man's prison in the event of confusion, announced by the prison director.
The confusions began at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at the Long Lartin Penitentiary in worcestershire, and it was not possible to stop them.
In order to address the situation, the competent authorities have led the special group called Tornado to the location, and eight prisoners are involved in confusions who have been reared into a building wing.
The members of the Special Force have suffered only minor head traumas that have been carried out at the site.
Statement by the spokesman of the Penal Order: “Specially trained prison guard team handles the situation in Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, transfer the responsible to the police and expect further prison sentences."
Long Lartin is held in a man's prison with more than 500 prisoners, among whom the most dangerous criminals in the country can be found.
In June, the prison director had to be treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, it was also necessary to help the Special Force to strike a serious disruption in which the prisoners attacked the staff of the prison with biliary balls.
The hurricane Rosa suddenly threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but the situation of the drought areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely achieved by tropical depression, but it is expected that the state should account for this at the beginning of the next week, when the remaining hurricane baptized by Rosa is swept through the desert southwest, increasing drastically the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparations from West Arizona until the south and east of Nevada, as well as the south-eastern areas of California and Utah; it also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is predicted to move straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive Monday night and bring large rains with it.
The Phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclons have reached within the 200 miles of Phonenix, in the form of tropical storm or depression!
The hurricane Katrina, for example in 1967, has approached the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a precipitation of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, for example in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southern desert areas (Medium areas of the Rocky Mountains, Large Basin, etc.), 25-50 mm precipitation can be calculated, but in some places it may fall 100 mm.
Rain brought by Rosa may bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning, as the region is currently under severe droughts.
Despite the serious danger of floods, part of the rainfall can have a positive impact on the southern landscapes that fight the aerodrome.
"The American Drought Observer Service says that more than 40% of Arizona's territory is affected by a minimum extreme dryness, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category," says the weather.com report.
Hurricane Rosa will first reach the coast in the Mexican sub-California peninsula.
It remains hurricane, bringing up a wind of up to 137 km/h on Sunday morning, reaching about 600 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific and will lose its power.
So it is expected that Mexico's coasts will be reappeared as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening hours.
It is possible to expect dense rain in some areas of Mexico, which significantly increases the possibility of flooding.
“The rainages may mean a rain of between 70 mm and 150 mm from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora, where a 250 mm precipitation may occur,” says the weather.com report.
Rosa then proceeds as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north before Tuesday, early in the morning, to reach the border of Arizona, until then, in the form of tropical depression, to reach the southern areas of Utah by Tuesday.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains will be extraordinary rainfalls in Lower California, Northwest Sonora and in the southern desert areas of the USA,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rainfalls are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning and fertiliser flows in desert areas, and the mountains should be avoided from landfalls.

Hundreds of people died in a landquake in Indonesia, the number of dead is rising.
Many have been crushed by the price, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when the giant waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a runaway on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the local authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered together at the festival in Palu on Friday, when the high waves of nearly six feet (18 feet) reached the coast, and many were ruined and destroyed.
The escape price was triggered by a 7.5 earthquake.
“As yesterday voiced the pausing price surveillance, people simply stayed on the coast, they were not fleeing, so they became victims of waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesian disaster control agency (BNPB) at the Jakartai press conference.
“The escape price came not only from itself, cars, tails, houses and all else from the beach,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching the beach.
Some of them climbed to the top of the trees from the price, and escaped, said.
Approximately 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
In the air records published by the Agency on the disaster, there are numerous destroyed buildings and business sites, several twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further recessions.
The earthquakes could be perceived in an area where around 2.4 million people live.
According to the Statement of the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), the earthquake in Friday released approximately 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dumped in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical capabilities could strengthen the impact of the fleet price.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was "significant", in the disaster thousands of houses were destroyed, and hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
More victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that the number of injured persons was 540 and they were looking for 29 more people.
Nugroho stated that the number of injured persons and the damage caused could be even greater in the area called Donggala in the coastal area from Palu to 300 km (190 km), as it was closer to the area of the earthquake.
The communication "totally paralyzed, no information can be obtained" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"They live there in more than 300 000" is stated in the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the professionals and volunteers of the organisation are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
"The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse", they said.
The Agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday on the fact that it did not inform the population of the Palut fleet price, but according to the board, the waves have already reached the coast when the alarm was issued.
On the social sides of the amateur tape, a man is seen trying to warn the people on the streets with desperate crys from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, the giant water wall will be trapped to the shore with cars and buildings.
The Reuters News Agency has not yet been able to prove the recording's authenticity.
The earthquake and the fleet price have caused electricity loss, inevitable communications around Palu, so the authorities can coordinate rescue works more hardly.
Assistance shipment from Jakarta and other cities with military transport aircraft, the authorities say that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential articles.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate aid work and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Widodo is planning to visit all the evacuation centres set up for Sunday.
The number of victims of the fugitive price in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under the tents set up in the courtyard of the office, but they met the trails of terrible destruction during their journey, said Doseba.
“ They said they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he said.
– It's really bad."
While assisting teams have contributed to preparing disaster response work, some have complained that foreign professionals with great experience in this area were unable to travel to Palura.
According to the Indonesian regulations, aid, aid supplies and staff from all overseas will only be released to the country if the location of accident is declared as an area affected by disaster at national level.
This hasn't happened until now.
“The case continues to be treated as a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, one of the spokespersons of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As the government recognises that this is indeed a disaster at national level, we can allow international aid services to enter, but so far no notification has been made."
On the second night after Friday's shaking and escape, please, the missing friends and family members continued to hope that they would also be among those who are in love with those who have a wonderful escape smuggled some light into the dark mood of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channel during the rescue work.

Gendon recalled that when the news about the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread between the gliders, he desperately tried to reach the competitors on WhatsApp for hours who took part in the coastal festival, please.
However, in addition to the messages, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pips.

Kanye West: the rapper's name has changed to Yra
Kanye West, the rapper's name from now on, Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday by the following message: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
For some time, the 41-year-old West has been called "Ye Bece," and that's the title of his eighth album in June.
She announced the exchange of names before Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, Yandhi.
The show takes over Ariana Grande's place, who renounced the role in the show on "conscious reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not just shortening the present name of the rapper, according to his previous statements, it is also religious for West.
“I know that the word “Ye” is the most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “te”, West mentioned earlier when he spoke to Big Boy’s radio programme director about his album’s address.
- So I'm you and I are, and we're all one.
The Canye means it's the only one, and it's only Ye, which represents the good, bad, confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who love to change their names.
For example, Sean Combs has been running with Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that Love and Brother Love would be preferable from now on.
West's former constituent, JAY-Z, has also varied several times by the fact that his name is to be written together, with a bondmark, or maybe a large letter.
The Mexican president promised not to engage the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president, promised that he would never take the force against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised on Tlatelolco, that he would never use the army to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire to the participants of a peaceful demonstration, causing about 300 deaths when the left-wing student movements showed signs of strength in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – he grants students a monthly financial contribution and plans to set up further free public universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that lead young people to the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the financing framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for research in this direction, published Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and employee of artificial intelligence solutions who used Google, Microsoft and Apple earlier.
This was said after the US Government made notifications of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US has no official MI strategy.
In the meantime, China also announced its related plans: the country aims to become the first MI developer in the world by 2030.
"Double the cost framework of MI research would be a good start, since all other countries are significantly below the US and are at a threshold for the next breakthrough of MI areas", said Lee.
By doubled research aid, it could also increase the chance that the United States will take the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence and announced the interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the director of the Snovation Ventures Company. The company has invested in one of China's most significant MI company, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on a MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later acted as a Microsoft Research Board member and chairman of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the results of technology competitions previously advertised by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and he was interested in when they would organise the next event, because it would then be possible to search for new future developers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state aid for their research, said Lee.
He added: “Not China decays the scientific leaders, but large companies. ”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have also signed several major university skulls to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, the amendment of immigration policy could also greatly help the United States' efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that you should automatically receive a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” she said.
In July 2017, the GOC announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science base provides similar support to the employees of academic institutions, as the US National Scientific Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the United States Department of Defence has established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI centre, where various industry professionals and academies can work together, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
NSF currently spends 100 million dollars a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the law of the United States, which has planned to set up a National Security MI committee, has not taken further steps for the purpose of this case for months.
People's votes in Macedonia on change in the name of the country
The population of Macedonia was held at the Sunday referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country “The Republic of the Sea”. This step would solve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which prevented the country from accepting the EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it has a need for a Greek area similar to that, so far he has defended the country's NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments agreed on the new name of the state, but according to national emotion counterparts, the ethnic identity of the most slavic population of Macedonia would be undermined by the name change.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the launched bojkott campaign, he was doubted whether the 50% participation rate needed for the valid referendum.
The question on the voting dossier is as follows: "Does it support NATO and EU membership and accept an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are at the top of the argument that this price should be paid to be one of the countries that have risen in Macedonia, the Roma of Yugoslavia, to be the possibility of membership of the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skop.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, sufficient Members have declared that they feel mandatory for the outcome of the vote.
A two-third majority is needed to change the name in Parliament.
According to the National Election Committee, no notice of irregularities has been received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% at the point. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (66% of the registered voters were finally involved).
“I came to vote for my children because we are in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopj, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and sons of Dushko, took up their voxes in Sztrumica, during the referendum of 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In his sculpture, before Parliament's building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for the referendum voters.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with proud, upright head, and not through the chat door,” said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of the integration of Europa."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be counted with investments in Macedonia, to which a country with higher unemployment than 20% needs a great deal.
“I believe that the majority will support our case, because more than 80% of the population of the country are fundamentally supporting the EU and NATO membership,” said Zaev after giving its vote.
He also added that the 'yes' vote means 'insurement of the future of the country'.
According to a survey published by a political research institute in Macedonia last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
On the basis of another survey made by Macedón Telma TV, the participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the vote, 70% said that they would vote with a yes.
In order to ensure that the referendum is valid, the participation rate must be at least 50% by one vote.
The inappropriateness of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western Government, which was in power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, the player in Manchester City gains the full brighton protection with a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deeply treated with Brighton's protection, so Manchester City won 2 to 0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in England.

The Argentine Warrior was the first step of the attack to get a patch on the middle track, and
The three Brighton guards have escaped to the open field.
That's when he surrounded Aguero with four green fields.
He's deceived a protector, and then he runs more on his way to the 16th of Brighton.
And then it went to the left for the Sterling that came up there.
The British fighter has already returned the ball to Aguero in force within the 16th, who has completed the action on the right foot, inventing the Brighton Network Guard, Mathew Ryan's gate right.
“Agueró has problems with her legs,” said the reporters, Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City.
– We agreed that you could play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, that's when he got a goal."
The initial advantage of Sterling's action has been achieved by the blues in the English championship.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, even when
Aguero on the brightoniak square has received a great past.
He started a beautiful cross ball towards Leroy Sane on the left edge.
Sane was playing with the ball for a while before he started Sterling long.
On the blue battle, he was just able to push the ball into the gate before he slipped to the bottom line.
The nearest city on Tuesday, from 12:55 in Sinsheim, Germany, is playing with the Hoffenheim team in the League of Champions in Rhein-Neckar.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for Rockies.
Since the Nationals team missed the possibility of getting into the post season, they had no reason to really push.
The always competing Scherzer, however, is looking forward to taking a race against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play. Rockies is a game advantage in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball.
At least one comforting place Rockies secured you with the win against Nationals on Friday night, but getting their first title is still waiting for you.
"No matter how much we have a chance, we can stand against them that the spirit of the audience and the other team in Denver is now expected to be at the roof of the whole year.
I'm sure I'm in the mood to get out!"
The Nationals team still has to pick the starter for Sunday, but the news is that Scherzer will be the thrower in this situation.
For Scherzer, who took part in a drum training on Thursday, this will be the 34th drop on Sunday, usually his rest day.
The right-handed Washington player has 18-7 in this season, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation of the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we've done is at stake.
We're only five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big ones, the big ones, and I'm not going on my own, but I'm actually going, and that's why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates", he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical groups of democrats are doing with their own eyes.
They were truly determined, and they were able to take any means to recover power, to see the evil and the lowlyness.
It doesn't matter who they're hurting who they're trying to have control in their hands, that's what they want, control and power, but we don't leave ourselves."
According to the President, the Democrats are putting in place the "resistance and obstruction".
"They have seen all this in the last four days," he said, "the democrats are angry and malicious and ugly."
According to his name, he mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs, who, as the hearing, declared his voiceful reluctance to the gathered crowd.
“Remember, what else did he answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, uh, no, wait - all this with a very bad body speech, that was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He doesn't tolerate those who say what they think freely.
I wasn't surprised at all when the Momentum's activists in my party decided to censor.
Finally, I am only the last in the long series of working parties who have been told that they are not welcome because we have said what we think.
My fellow MEP, Mr Ryan, has been treated like this because of his unorthodox opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't understand Jeremy Corbyn.
Moreover, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which is ironically the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East was that they wanted a “inclusive and productive meeting”.
For the majority of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, however, the sound has changed, and the promise of a more retarded, polite policy has been forgotten if ever happened.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate the different views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, who I thought were similar to our political attitude, have been expected more and more recently to turn my back on my own opinion, and to take a position on things that I would never agree with, by the way, to talk about national security matters or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, irrespective of what I said, they're going to be on the social sides, they're demanding my resignation, they're gonna criticise the policy of the middle, and they're telling me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than many of my colleagues, because the statements to me are usually confined to politics.
I admire the prominence and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to stand up on a daily basis and not run.
The most disappointing aspect of our policies is that attacks at this level have become standards.
Jeremy Corbyn told me last week that the Labour Party had to support the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have renounced diversity, and with all the 'confidence' motions and all the amendments to the electoral rules, the torment of the parties is increasingly limited.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to hold back, not to be so saying, and then “all will be fine. ”
However, that is not why I stepped on the political path.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, because I was shocked by the government of Thatcher so neglected the schools that my classroom was almost depleted and I fought for a better approach to the most needy as a local council and a government minister.
I've never hid my political views, and I haven't done anything different during the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was absolutely clear for all of us what political views I have on, and which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that in this situation, when the country goes to Brexit, which is not only for families, but also for companies and public services, I do not understand why I need all the time and energy to question my loyalty to the Head of the Labour Party.
However, my most important message is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that any threat or political threat to redemption does not hinder me from acting according to my own judgment and taking into account everyone's interests.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr will beat the peak unbeatably
Two late attempts changed somewhat in the end result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr win is worth the most fun game of the day, Tennent's Premiership.
The team is currently on the edge of the table, the only unbeatable of the ten teams.
Due to their uncompromising protection and their overwhelming use, they won, so coach and coach Peter Murchie have all the reasons for their satisfaction.
“We had to meet a serious challenge in the course of our games, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, the Melrose player, said: “We need to know that Ayr has used his situations much better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in 14 minutes, from which Frazier Climo made a point, Ayr was advantageous. Thanks to the yellow paper that was available to the captain Rory Hughes, who was borrowed by Warriors, Melrose could have letornated the difference, but the attempt of Jason Baggot was not the point.
Climo sweated the protection of Ayr with a criminal, just half-time, and then one-person experiment, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half-time, and Patrick Anderson's attempts to sell Baggo, reducing the team's disadvantage to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered severe injury and had to be taken off the track, and the Ayr continued to increase its advantage with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, whose berries were managed by Climó.
Blair Macpherson, Captain Ayr, got a yellow card, and Melrose, in a human order, managed to stop Bruce Colvine's experiment, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to lock up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card that he put on Climo without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down on the criminal line behind the Ayr assault team.
Climo sold what he repeated almost immediately after the reopening, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and forwarded Gregor Henry's warrior for the fifth attempt of the homemen.
The premier of Still Game started a new career in the catering industry
It seems that one of the still Game stars, Ford Kieran, moves towards the catering industry: it was discovered that a restaurants were at the edge of the director's company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in the popular series of BBC, which he writes together and in which he acts together with his old comic partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth year will be your final, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow’s “flowing catering industry”.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without the coast hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patroling the sailor-decorated Navy Command in La Paz.
In the middle areas, ocean blue flags are floating.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon declare the following motto: “We have the right to the sea.
We have a duty to get it back."
In Bolivia without the coast, the memories of the lost coast, which Chile took away in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, and the desire to regain the waves of the Pacific is strong.
These hopes may have been most powerful for many decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court of Justice of October to close five years.
“Bolívia has the ball, which flows with the spirit of coherence and peace to people who are in a positive mood waiting for the end development,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivia monitors the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court of Justice stands next to Bolivia, and after several decades of rapsodical attitudes, Chile will be obliged to sit on a negotiating table in order to get Bolivia's own access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Chairman of Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous origin, who faces a controversial battle that must continue to be re-electioned for next year, can lose much with Monday’s judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia and that would not change the situation much if its decision would still be favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations Council in the Netherlands does not have the right to judge over the chilean areas and has also foreseen that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court was born only six months after the closing speeches indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chile expert of international law.
In addition, the last four years have not helped Bolivia, but he has even taken it back.
“The current Bolivian government has turned the issue of the exit to the sea” explains Zarate.
"With Morales' enemy rhetoric, the remainder of the chiles has gone away."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue after what has happened.
Since 1962, the two countries have not delegated an ambassador to each other.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, Bolivia's representative in Hague, disagrees with the conclusion that the judicial decision would have been unusually fast.
For Bolivia, Monday is a “priced opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and the possibility of both coming out well from the closure of 139 years of controversy,” said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to make a political advantage.
“Bolívia will never give up his right to the Pacific,” he added.
– The judgment gives us an opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
According to the North Korean Minister, Ri Jongho's country will not be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comment was made when Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Minister of Foreign Affairs, appeared to have resumed the closed nuclear negotiations over three months after the Singapore Summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jungun.
According to Ri, "I'm sorry" to believe that the continuation of sanctions and the statement closing the Korean war will never be enough to force North Korea on its knees.
Washington will stand by the adoption of the declaration if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards decommissioning.
Both Kim Jangun and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, widespread skepticism entails Phenjan's commitment to disarmament of arsenal, which is probably considered the only key of the country's safety.
Pompeo is planning a phenjani visit for the next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump peak.
The Paris fashion shows the giant head covers that will soon appear in top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely hide the day, you don't have to search for it anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of unusually over-size head covers as part of their spring/Summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed by the Paris fashion-style audience.
Non-practical hats have generated sensation at Instagram during the summer, and the above fashion designers have also placed their remarkable works on the runway.
Valentino's most prettiest piece was an exaggerated beige hat, which was decorated by a featherful, wide karima, and almost completely absorbed the head of the models.
The other over-size supplements appeared with gem-decorated grenade, a magic hat, even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep the head warm.
In addition, Thom Browne came up with the choice of bizarre masks, just before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had their mouth sewn together and reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute couture.
One of these was like a diving mask, supplemented with pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting jam.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
According to the idea of style analysts, huge hats may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The over-size hats follow the path from "La Bomba" to a 60-cm wide straw hat we have seen from everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult worm behind the poorly practical hat that conquered social sites has presented another piece on the runway: a sauna beach sand, which is almost the size of the bathing suit model.
The dark orange raphia bag, which is decorated by raphiaboys and has a white skin grip on top, was one of the outstanding pieces of the collection of La Riviera in spring 2019 in Paris.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect the huge hats and beach bags to appear next summer in the top-class dress stores. The designer has had such an elementary effect that it would be difficult to deny the demand for over-size supplements.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the new exams, this situation has not changed to 2018, which is only further enhanced by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students study such institutions, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and are seeking to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, careers and the position they play as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to plan and introduce customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and searched lessons.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone he understands in a language, it comes to your head.
But if you speak in his tongue, it gets to his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
The results of this year's exams show that the best results from foreign languages have been achieved across the independent schools across the country.
68 percent of all students studying foreign language reached higher Grade A (more than 85 percent).
Based on the data gathered from SCIS 74 schools, 72 percent of students received higher Grade A in mandarin, while 63 percent of students in Germany, 72, 69 of France and 63 percent of Spanish, reached Grade A.
These results also underpin the fact that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as an essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need to know in the future.
Languages today, as chosen objects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics as well as independent and other types of schools.
The 2014 survey of the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training showed that 17% of employers are facing difficulties in filling in empty positions due to lack of linguistic knowledge.
This also makes it more and more necessary for young people to pursue a successful career.
Since the knowledge of foreign languages is increasingly expected in more jobs, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of what kind of career someone chooses to learn a foreign language, he gains lifelong knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationals will automatically provide a competitive advantage for the applicant who speaks more languages.
According to YouGov’s survey, 75 percent of respondents, in which 4000 adults were asked in the United Kingdom in 2013, did not know well enough in any foreign language to speak with others, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15%).
It is therefore important that we emphasise the language education of children.
More languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, with better chances to apply for more important work when they are raised as adults.
In Scotland, they will be working different languages in all schools.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of major importance to the United Kingdom for 2020.
Whatever the area of the child's interest, you can learn a number of different languages than independent schools and train teachers who are experts in their own territory.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, to preserve anything in the future.
It is not difficult to note that languages in the current global business environment remain vital for the future of a country and that this should also be reflected by education.
As a matter of fact, the knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools offer the choice, diversity and quality of education to young Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this must be the way it is.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is presenting the Lakers on Sunday at San Diego
They don't have to wait long for the fans to sit on the screen to see LeBron James get on track first in the colors of L.A. Lakers.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play on the front season opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're gonna spend on the field, it's still questioning.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play for only a limited time.
After a few days ago, they asked James about his plans with Lakers in the six-game season.
“On this point of my career, I don’t have to play in the premature season to be ready,” she replied.
The campaign of Trump in Western Virginia and YouTube
Donald Trump Wheeling, West Virginia, starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of Trump's five trained events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi who support him.
Now that the vote confirming the candidate of the Supreme Court's vacant position has been postponed, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose their power over the Congress when the votes will take place in November.
When will Trump start tonight in the Western Virginia event, and where can you follow it online?
The speech by Trump wheelingi (Nyugat-Virginia) begins tonight, i.e. on Saturday 29 September 2018, East time, at 7.00 p.m.
Trump can also be followed online through the live mediation of YouTube via Western Virginia.
Trump is likely to affect the hearing of the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which has proven particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote has been suspended for up to a week until the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of suddenly growing events is to assist the situation of Republicans before the November elections.
According to Trump’s campaign adviser, the five events will be “enacted by voters and supporters next week, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently held in Senate and the Congress House,” says Reuters.
“To know the governance of the Congress in his hands, the critical point of his political plans is that the President visits as many states as possible. We are looking at a close campaign period,” reported a campaign leader requesting his name to be shut down.
The event scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in wheeling “Ohio and Pennsylvania can also bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania and be included in the media reports in Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where more than 40 percent won in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate of the Republic of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the surveys, is not in a favourable position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to take personal action to participate better in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, the politician of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Couple: the American team struggles with a full shoulder before Sunday individuals to keep the hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the four-tips of Saturday afternoon needed the Ryder coup.
The grace and momentum's fancy shirt is a fairly airborne sports conception, but every player believes in it, mostly in races like the Ryder coup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point drive and only four of their advantages, so we can say that we have the ball right now,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead to Europe and twelve can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they've finally got a little backbone, and they've got a lot of encouragement, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they've both got three points from the four.
Spieth proved mistaken from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His glorious victory crys grew louder, as he progressed with the round, invented and balanced with a critical swing in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were in double disadvantages after two.
The decision-making of the game resulted in similar joy crying than the 15 holes, a kind that can believe with the viewer that the American team is not lost yet.
“Only you need to dig deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trace.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair of Ryder cubes, could get more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange, but some of the four have brought four of them to love, and it seems they can't make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who did not perform the par over Saturday afternoon and delivered similar performance on Friday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning’s last nine stages.
Thanks to the dynamics between this series and among them and the public that supports them, they became the measure by Sunday, and no one expects to secure Europe's victory at Le Golf National, such as Fleetwood or Molinari with the sun.
The best one at a time would be a victory gained by different holes.
However, it would be early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon executed by Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning when he was playing with Alex Noren.
Once, one and two hits above the par at the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish, which put them in a wave valley where they had no chance of climbing out.
There'll be no one to help me out of your hole on Sunday.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are extremely fun thanks to the interactions of the couples. You can see who gives you advice, what you don't give, and how you can change the strategy during an eyewitness.
Europe has been a better team so far, and it begins with a significant advantage for the last day, but this section of the Four has shown that there is a wrestling in the U.S. team, even if many of them have been missed, especially on the American side.
Europe's 10-6 benefits start the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder coup after the Saturday four balls and four matches have been closed with 10-6 results.
Tommy Fleetwood and the twin of Francesco Molinari led their hair, gaining two wins against the Sick Tiger Woods, bringing the difference to four points on the Le Golf National field.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which is trying to get back the Hazeltine trophy lost two years ago, dominated against the constant failure team in the morning four-ball matches, winning the series to 3-1.
America's been more resistant in the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who are only mentioned as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – the second pair of Ryder's history, which acquired four points at four opening games.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed couple in the four balls, their great team games defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American newcomer, Bryson Dechambau's double to a firm 5+4.
Woods, who dragged himself in two games all Saturdays, sometimes cheated on her talent, but 19 of the 29 games have already lost the four balls and foursomes, seven in line.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four balls, had returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third position of the world ranks, in the fours to 2+1.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this pleasant, seasonal day, from the southwest of Paris.
The three-fold titler Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans two points on Saturday.
A tortured 2&1 victory was made against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter pair in the four balls, and later returned to defeat Poultert and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 proportions after the first two holes were lost.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team only managed to come back from a four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's address protection team is still inadequate to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being the second best, a Sunday counter-attack seems to be rather unrealistic.
"Clear" to unanimously decommission North Korea if you do not trust your negotiating partner
The North Korea Foreign Minister announced to the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased confidence in the United States of America and that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho told the World Organisation’s annual Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant and generous steps” during the last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile experiments, put the site of nuclear experiments into place, and promised not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“ Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– Without trust in America, we feel that the safety of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be removed unilaterally and firstly."
Although Ri reaffirmed North Korea's disappointment regarding Washington's opposition to the idea of "secondary" nuclear dismantling, which, according to the scenario, would receive rewards for the measures taken to date, it still seemed significant because it did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump at the first summit of the former, between the President of the US and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June and during which Kim promised to work on the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to make a formal point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States thinks that Phenjan has to give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington didn't release you from strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and that it increases pressure by sanctions to force us into his will, and it also objects to the conclusion of the war,” Ri said.
– The idea of being forced to kneel by sanctions is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is, unreliable sanctions just increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that it would be planned for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United Nations had spoken separately at the beginning of the week.
The Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Jzein in the last five months and added: “If the country concerned with nuclear decommissioning would be South Korea, not the United States, then the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula would not have been such a problem.”
Despite this, Ri's voice was dramatically different from last year when he announced at the United Nations Assembly that the targeting of the North American continent with North Korean missiles is inevitable after Trump, the evil president, Kimet, called "a missile man", who is on a suicide mission.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “full destruction”, sold Kimet with praise that he had the courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but also noted that there was still a lot of work left and that sanctions would remain until North Korea executes nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday Trump said that there was no time limit, that is, “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, the US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Sanctions of the Security Council must be respected indelibly until they have reached the actual, final, proven nuclear decommissioning."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to refrain from financing Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rív at the recession of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Phenjan in the next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been in North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't been too well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of taking out "gengsterly claims".
North Korea promised, in the course of the meeting with Mun this month, to decommission a missile and a nuclear facility if the United States would also take "the appropriate steps".
According to my point, the "admissible steps" mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore or steps that could lead to the normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are trained to rest enough.
The Harvard University is a new subject this year, and the students have been sleeping for several years, fighting against the culture of cats that are more and more widely able to learn the whole nightly lessons heated by caffeine.
Academic concluded that students of the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which says the first such training in the US, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler who educates sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and practises as a doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the course to develop a lecture on the impact of sleep-taking on learning.
“In the end a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why now, I am facing this as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep that surprised me," he told Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students are told how appropriate sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their studies and sports performance, not only on their overall safety.
According to Paul Barreira, the professor of the Harvard University of Medical Sciences and the director of the university's health service, the university decided to launch the course because during the week, students were found exceptionally unsleaded.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee bars, curtains, gymnastics and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance affects sleeplessness and why sleeping routine is important.
Another part explains with the participants how long-term sleep withdrawal increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present the map of the university's areas with interactive icons in order to promote the daily routine reflection of participants.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we think that they have the right to these knowledge, as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture, where it is considered to be a performance to study one night, continues to flourish, said, adding that the pressure on modern technology and students is constantly increasing, resulting in increasing problems of sleeplessness.
A sufficient and high-quality sleep is a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even from obesity, because sleep-taking forces the brain to starve and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in the formation of the course, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year, Harvardon took up one of the professor's classes.
He said that the eyes were opened there and that they encouraged him to scratch along with the launch of a university-level training.
He hopes that as a next step, post-gradual students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before they enter the competition area.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning for sleeping, awakening, and familiarize with the harmful effects of the electric screens and the "blue light" released by the LED light sources, which can easily stimulate them from the rhythm of the day and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gains a goal
The Rangers had another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb, Steven Gerrard, sliced his team down in Livingston 1-0.
The ibroxies tried to get their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory of St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered the second defeat of the 18 team of Gary Holt as the manager of the team. So they stay eight points away from the first position of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship), Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the half-time, and the unmotivated team of Rangers hasn't even got close to the equation.
While the Rangers slipped to the sixth place, Livingston was stretched to the third place, just because of the goal gap, the Hibernian was missing.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties, after the coastal indicator Calum Spence’s head injury has required medical care due to an object probably dropped from the sight of the guests.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the predecessor of the Betfred Couple by sweeping the Ayr.
Holt was on the same track with Livingston with the same 11 people who picked a point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to watch the game of the opponent wherever he was.
Although the Rangers led in the ballbirth, Livingston took it more with what he got.
You could have gotten a goal in the first two minutes when you first gave Menga to launch Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the middle runner couldn't sell the zigger.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed at Craig Halkett's team captain, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just hit the gate side.
The Rangers took control, but they had more hope in their game in the last third than self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he would have earned a punishment at the fifteen minutes when he crashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson was able to succumb his complaints in Colombia.
The Rangers could only show two first mid-term gates, but the former ibrox gate, Liam Kelly, was hardly caused by the weak shot of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempted to meet the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a zigger forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for the easy ending.
Gerrard decided during the break, Coulibalyt changed Ryan Kentre, and it almost immediately revealed its impact on the game when the extreme Morelos snatched, but Kelly, which brought the impressive form, blocked time.
Livingston continued to play just the kind of game that matched her, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and knocked down Jacobs' position before Lithgow had set up a corner.
As the exchange of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, who came in, tried to fight another eleven when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but he couldn't convince Thomson right now.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger accounter
Apart from our "sunday morning" almanach: September 30, 1882, just 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could result in a device known as Geiger accounting.
Since then, the Geiger accounting is one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado bells" (Coronado bells), the 1950s, strange cowboy scientists, Roy Rogerst and Dale Evanst, became part of the pop culture:
Man: "What is this wonder?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger accounter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be sought with it.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released for the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Hey, listen, he's a little stubborn! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live in the invention of his name.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the abnormal cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells
The vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells.
It is part of the method to win immune cells from the patient and then change them in a laboratory.
So they can "see" the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers, the treated immune cells are reinjected into the patient.
A pilot vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells has been able to say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the extraction of immune cells from the patient; they change the laboratory to “see” the protein called HER2, which is a common escort to a variety of cancers; then the retransplanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, Professor of the National Cancer Institute of the United States (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 "intensifies the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and endemic cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been used successfully in treating one of the types of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL's instrumentation of the MAGA cap was high in a twisted twisted twist of Trumpot.
It didn't work too well.
Kanye West was whistled in the studio of Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent manifestation in which Donald Trump was inviting President of the United States, and then announced that in 2020 he would apply for the presidential post.
After performing the third song of the Ghost Town that night in Make America's Great Again, she began to speak against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trumpot.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone white, he asks: ‘How can you like Trumpot, as a racist?’
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parodia in which Brett Kavanaugh, in Hollywood, was struggling with his testimony before the Senate Justice Committee about the sexual harassment charges of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcasted, the video of the West vocabulary was uploaded by Chris Rock's humorist on community sites.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to ruin the West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was stabbed behind the walls for his hat.
“They scared me behind the scenes.
They said, "Do not go out in that hat."
You scared me!
And they said I was in the deadly place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a deadly place? I'll wear my Superman clip because that means they can't tell me what to do, you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His manifestations were at least twice haunted by the audience, and the SNL’s actors were apparently embarrassed by one of the witnesses who said Variety: “The entire studio was quietly silenced. ”
Westet was invited instead of the singer Ariana Grande in the last moment whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before he died.
West asked more questions when the song I Love it made it dressed as Perrier glasses.
Westet was the leader of the Conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who provided his support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: OH, WHEN YOU ARE APPLIED IN THE THREE.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a conversation show, tweeted that West was simply “young and great”.
“But I have decided not to reward someone (by buying music or fashion articles or by supporting his “artistics”), who I believe is an ideology for you and distributed to the community that I belong to.
He's free.
But we too," he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist who changed his name, and he's stepped into Diddy's printouts, who we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg, also, recorded the name Snoop Lion, and of course, the former legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist who was known as Prince earlier.
They're accusing the belfastian restaurant delayer of attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was hung in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the case happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the DA.
Kit Harington, the star of the Thrones, is detrimental to excess manhood.
Kit Harington is most known as the Thrones' battle as Jon Snow, and HBO is full of violence in the fantasy series of medieval ages.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke against stereotypical cat heroes, highlighting that, in view of such heroes, young boys often feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
Kit said in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he said "something went aside" and raised the question of how to address the problem of the harmful effect of excess maleness in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague, Rose Leslie, said that it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I’m personally deeply affected by this issue — how did the image of maleness so distort? ” the actress asked.
– What have we taught men when they were kids about the problem that we are now facing?"
According to Kit, TV is responsible for spreading the distorted image of maleness, as the shows often include very masculin characters.
Continuing his thoughts, he added: “What is it that was born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What do streets and TV tell young boys that feel like men are the only way they can be?
I think that is one of the major questions of our time – and how we can change it.
'Cause it seems clearly something's wrong with young men."
Kit said in the interview that after the summer season of the serial, he will not be included in the Thronic War Prevention series or activities, because he has enough of battlefields and horses.
From November, Kit Sam Shepard will play a major role in the reprocessing of the film True West, which is about a producer and a brother of the robber of life.
The actor told me that the best thing he could get from the Thronic fight is his wife, Rose, who was recognized during the serial.
“I met my wife on the screen, so I owe my future family and my future life to the show,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who had the character of Kit, Jon Snow's love in the Emmy Prize fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, the number of new patients increased by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living in HIV and AIDS increased by 14% in the country.
According to health officials, this means more than 820 000 persons involved.
Only during the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
Compared to the previous, a change is that a significant majority of newly infected people have sexually captured the disease.
The disease spread rapidly by transfusion of blood previously infected in some parts of China.
However, health officers at a conference in the province of Junnia have declared that the number of such cases has been reduced to nearly zero ever since.
Nevertheless, compared to the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS increased by 100 000 in China.
The transfer of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since then.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are ultimately married to women due to the conservative value of the country.
The disease in these relationships spreads in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denys that one of his teams would have leaked the data of Republican Senators and condemned the "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. representative Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that one of his team's members published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia site of Senators.
According to the Democratic Representative in Los Angeles, the claims in question were distributed by ‘left-learning’ experts and websites.
Waters wrote on Twitter, “Strongness, lies, and more ugly lies.
The information published was reported to include the address and phone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was on the Internet on Thursday, and the unidentified person of the public, but it is certain that they were published on the Capitolium site during the senate hearing of the Supreme Tribunal candidate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three Senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pondit and RedState, are linked to Waters' office as an identifiable IP address, and they also reported information about one of Waters' team members, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars – continued Waters.
– My team member has no responsibility for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been injured by fraud and false accusations.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements were criticised quickly on the Internet, and the critics were also Ari Fleischer, former secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
– Based on this, Waters does not seem to have a blood mitigation required for his representatives.
If someone is suspected of something he didn't commit, he can't react angryly.
You can't behave so bad.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to be calm and calm."
Waters' reaction was apparently similar to the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to the political criticisms of the Democrat, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is candidate for a Republican candidate, has also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If true, then it's serious" he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his communication that his office informed the “competent authorities and police authorities” on false charges.
“We shall ensure that the person of the offenders is known – continued Waters – and that they are legally liable for all acts that endanger or jeopardise any member of the crew.”
Johnny English will strike again, or Rowan Atkinson's paranoid spy game
Today, it has become a tradition that we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception to this, in the booklet category, under Johnny English, which can be classified into the action line/Parodia, whose first part, Johnny English in 2003, the second part of Johnny English reloaded in 2011.
Will the British nation become a new export product of sarcastic, self - parodizing satírs in which we live on our own manifest paralysis?
It is so certain that Johnny English, incompetent Johnny English, had enough ammunition for another return — it is also clear from his name that this comic character was created to name the crowds of non-English native countries in the cinemas of the world.
Johnny English, of course, is a vague secret agent who, with a bizarre manner, thinks he's a bit of a reminder of the Clouseau Inspector, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the performance of the main title of the Firesections at the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international journey that Atkinson once played in a long-old Barclaycard TV advertising and who left chaos everywhere.
There's a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in the middle age armor to a helicopter, and then the rotors got knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comedy old man is well in the movie, but the film's humor doesn't really work, and it's not even necessary, because nowadays it's like a big-eyed franchises such as the James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series, they're bravely touching on the humor device.
Feeling that the humor of the movie is more targeting the children, and to me, Johnny English's successful adventurers aren't reaching the level of ideality and genius that Atkinson brings in the silly scenes of Mr. Bean's series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercrime broke into a super secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest fear of the practitioner Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, only had this small role in the film.
This can be the last angle to the coffin of the prime minister, whose political popularity is still ruined: Emma Thompson practically shapes Theresa May and brings everything out of the poorly written character.
Intelligence advisors explain to him that since he's found out that every active agent has been formed, he has to put a calm agent on the job.
This relaxed agent is, of course, only Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in a prestigious school since his retirement, but he teaches children to spy on the subject – here are, of course, funny scenes, while he describes the foundations of spying for the English "Rocksuli" method.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets again at the emergency briefing with his former, highly suffered arms carrier, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and he married a submarine captain who is always touching his mouth – the captain Vicki Pepperdine, who called for better roles than this.
So his Majesty’s two-sided “Batman and Robin” national security service is rerouted and confronted with Ophelia Bulletova, who is formed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a real destiny woman.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is getting more and more into the crismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy transforms it.
English and Bough will start their clown mission: they will light up a fancy French restaurant for a waitress, and then smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English will actually free the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end development, but whatever cheer and turn, it might make a little too much impression of a child movie.
The outcome's kind of medium.
As with the other Johnny English films, I was just wondering if the British film industry could finally play a role worthy of Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party denys that he's taking a four-day job week while he'd pay the British five-day wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft, introducing a four-day working week, all this by working for a five-day salary.
The party claims that it would like workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing extra day-to-day workers as a result of increased income.
On the basis of the draft, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking as much as they have ever been.
According to the sources, the idea is "appropriate" for the party's economic programme, which aims to drop the balance sheet language on the side of the workers in the country.
The four-day workweek idea is also supported by the Congress of Professional Organisations, which suggests that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Labour Party commented to Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced sooner than the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to another, the four-day work week is a vision that fits the party into the programme that would drop the balance in the economy to the workers, it also fits in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
It would not be the first to support this type of idea, the Green Party has already campaigned at the 2017 parliamentary elections with the four-day workweek promise.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the entire Labour Party.
The spokesman of the Labour Party stated: “The four-day work week is not one of the policies supported by the Party, and the question is not even on the agenda.”
John McDonnell, Minister for Shadow Money, presented the idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to fight to regain his power from "fantastic directors" and "resulters".
If the plans of the Minister for Shadow Money were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water supply companies would not recover the full profit they would receive, as a result of the "reductions" of the labour force government as a punishment of the suspected harmful activities.
McDonnell also reaffirmed that it would also make workers a member of the Board of Directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, which would thus be able to obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy were told in the "60 minutes" show that the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinions.
As a result of the FBI investigation against the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least one week later will be held in the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh's highest judge.
In his 60 minutes interview on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley John Kennedy and Republican Senators Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called the explosion of the case, after the prosecutions appeared, and I asked you, ‘You did it? ’
His answer was firm and clear."
However, Graham's vote seems to be concrete-proof.
“I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh and I need extremely serious charges to change my mind,” Graham said.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has strongly denied the claims, he added to Graham, Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one named Dr. Ford has proven the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will happen."
What is the global citizen festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York begins the annual concert of music, the festival of the Global Citizen. World stars at the festival are going to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The global citizen's festival will be arranged on a seventh occasion, expected to be filled in tens of thousands of Central Park's Great Platform, where the participants will not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but may also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: eradication of the deprivation by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first organized as part of the Global Poverty Project in 2012. The project is operated by an international interest group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in active poverty fight.
A free ticket for the concert may be given to those who are engaged in certain tasks or activities, such as voluntary work, e-mailing to a leading politician, a telephone call or any other valuable activity that can draw attention to the purpose of the project: poverty eradication.
But really, how successful has the global citizen been in achieving the goals it has set for the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert to win others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "clichtivism" when people feel that they have contributed to a case by signing or writing a Twitter message on an online petition?
Since 2011, the global citizen's data indicate that more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by the project's supporters, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to the allocation of USD 37 billion to policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group claimed that 390 commitments and notifications were due to their actions, 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected in the collection of donations.
The group estimates that the money collected has already contributed directly to the lives of almost 649 million people.
The Power of Nutrition is one of the main commitments, which is a partnership between investors and exporters located in the United Kingdom, which aims to “support children to achieve their potential”. The organization promised $35 million to help Ruanda eliminate hunger after having received more than 4700 Twitter messages from “global citizens”.
“The United Kingdom government and the donors, the national governments and similar global citizens can put social injustices and under-care among the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also argues that after more than 5,000 actions requested the United Kingdom to improve the food of their mothers and children, the government separated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve 5 million women and children.
Frequent questions published on the global citizen’s website are one of the following: “Why do they think it can be eliminated? ”
The global citizen answers: “There will be a long and difficult way to get stuck and sometimes fail.
But as with previous civil and segregational movements, we also achieve our goal because we are stronger together."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also be present at the this year's New York event, and the directors will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister for Interior: The United States would use the military blockade to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary," either Washington would enter the Navy against the entry into the Russian energy carriers, such as the Russian energy in the Middle East, quoted the American Minister for Interior in Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's active presence in Syria, in particular as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is only an excuse for Russia's acquisition of new energy markets.
“I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” said Zinke in a statement.
And the Minister of Interior says there are methods to prevent the Russians.
“The United States can ensure that maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary. It can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke arranged for the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself, by the way, as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be punished in the same way as the use of existing energy carriers and the introduction of new ones", said Zinke, while calling Russia "a single-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export flown natural gas to Europe, thus excluding Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump Government, including the President himself, will convince Germany to retreat behind the "inappropriate" wire project called North Stream 2, which if it comes to effect, Moscow will make Germany a "deposit".
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the existing capacity doubled, with an increase to 110 billion cubic metres, with a EUR 11 billion North Stream 2 wires exclusively of an economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so vigorously opposed to the project, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are in the same position as that energy should not be used for pressure training and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely", said Russian Minister Novak, after a meeting with the American Minister for Energy in Moscow, Rick Perry.
The attempt to convince the Americans went backwards because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the US to avoid interference with the EU energy policy, as it would keep itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state interferes in our energy matters,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Association (BDI) after his last meeting with Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putyin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts "he's seriously considering" to take the initiative for the presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts said that after the mid-term elections, he would take a seriously into consideration for the presidency.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Saintoke, confirmed that he was considering his departure.
“It is time for women to get into Washington and put the poor government in place, and it is time for a woman to be president,” Warren said the Hill.
– After 6 November, I will seriously consider taking my leave for the presidency."
At the city meeting, Warren criticised Donald Trumpot, and said that he said he would “to take the country in a bad direction. ”
Warren said, “I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy.
Warren has spokenly criticised Trumpot and Brett Kavanaugh's highest court candidate.
In a Friday Twitter message, Warren wrote: "Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, on the basis of a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's massachusetts voters do not think that Warren should start for the Presidency in 2020.
Based on the Suffolk University Political Elementary Centre and the Boston Globe survey, 58% of the Warren "probability" voters should not be allowed to take part in the presidency until:
32% of them support President Warren's candidate.
According to the survey, the former Governor of Deval Patrick's candidate was most of the respondents, 38% of them would support it, and 48% of them would oppose it.
In the context of the presidential election in 2020, the name of high-level democratic politicians was raised, among other things, as former Vice-President Joe Biden or Senator Bernie Sanders Vermonti.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden decides until January whether or not to start.
Referring to Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he registered in September
He was arrested on Monday night by the charges of domestic violence.
“What my son is going through through, as he has returned home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of the PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning home,” said Sarah Palin to the audience at the meeting in the State of Donald Trump Oklahoma, in Tulsa.
He called the arrest of Palin’s son “the elephant in the room” and said that his son, like the other war veterans, “moved, hardened, and he keeps thinking of whether he has due respect for the service that all his comrades, pilots and other members of the army have done for the country.”
Track Palint was arrested in Wasilla of Alaskan, accusing a woman's family of violence.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support the judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new American asylum policy that allows those who are fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. have written a letter of expertise on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who attacks the policy in court, writes the NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions initiated by the US Civil Society Union against the federal policy was not made public in August.
According to the applicant, his partner and "the sons of violent crime" were assaulted, but on 20 July American officials rejected his asylum claim.
She's being held in Texas.
Attorneys of the States that support Grace were described as places where many applications for asylum to the United States are due, since in these countries the violence committed by criminal gangs and within the family causes a constant problem.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the Committee on Immigrant Appeals (BIA) of the Committee on Immigrant Recovery of Immigrants in 2014, which allows immigrants with no documents to apply for asylum in order to escape their domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C. Attorney General stated in a Friday communication that the new policy “forsakes over decades of state, federal and international law”.
“All applications for asylum under federal law shall be evaluated in accordance with the facts and circumstances that exist, and such an obstacle violates this principle, as provided for in the expert letter.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the policy rejecting immigration is harming the American economy, as immigrants become more entrepreneurs and "the lowest level of jobs".
In June, the DG Jeff Sessions instructed the asylum judges not to grant asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and crime gangs.
"The right of asylum to leave his country because of racial, religious, national belongings, persecution of certain social groups or political convictions, or a legitimate fear of persecution," said Sessions on 11 June when announced the policy.
Asylum rights were not found to solve all the problems that arise every day worldwide – be of any serious nature.
A suspicious rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead is doubled, the paramedics run a race with time.
The situation of survivors is getting less and less visible.
“Everybody is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, reassured a fevery little boy in one of the evacuation centers of Palu.
- The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have water."
Some residents returned to their homes to save them from the wet stuff that can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospitals, which have also been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, are not persuaded to provide people.
Some of the injured persons, including broken spinal and shoulder Dwi Harist, were also transferred to the Palui Military Hospital. Patients were provided outside the hospital building because of the massive postures.
The man’s eyes filled with tears when he recalled the fifth floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were staying in, he shaked into the destructive shaking.
“ There was no time to escape.
I think I was stuck in the fallen walls – Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family came to the city for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The American ambassador accuses China of provoking the country with propaganda ads.
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propagandate in the American press. This was a week after a formal Chinese newspaper presented a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that underlined the mutual advantages of the American-China trade relations.
The President of the United States Donald Trump in China Daily Des Moines Register – Iowa’s newspaper – sold in the largest number of copies – argued that he tried to intervene in the US Congress elections of 6 November on Wednesday, while he accused China of attempting to intervene.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the American elections, some American officials reporting to Reuters represent a new stage in his increasingly strong action against Washington China, which aims to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual that foreign governments promote trade with their countries through advertisements, Beijing and Washington are intensifying commercial war, where new and new customs duties are imposed on each other's import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the customs duties imposed by the Chinese as a response to the target of exporters in the States in which Trump and the Republican Party, such as Iowa, were popular.
Terry Branstad, the former Chinese ambassador and Governor of Iowa, stated that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses, because the Iowa State exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in the article on Sunday Des Moines Register that “China continues to provoke our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
Branstad wrote: “The Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of expression and press by spreading propagandate in paid ads in Des Moines Register.
– However, if we go to a peking journalist, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all reflect the different opinions of Chinese people on the horror growth prospects of the Chinese economy, because the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “One of the most famous newspapers in China was not willing to retire” its article, but did not mention the newspaper.
According to the evidence, the Republicans may alienate women's voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh botr.
According to the explanatory notes, many high-level Republican politicians may take the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh to defend sexual harassment charges, in particular the support of women's voters before the mid-term elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn – says Grant Reeher, a politician in the Maxwell School of the University of Syria, is a Saturday article of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the Flake Republican senator in Arizona, Jeff Flake, will be sufficient to reassure the angry voters at the last moment.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor in November", said a Washington newspaper, D.C., says Karine Jean-Pierre, the headmaster of the progressive group MoveOn and his national spokesman on Friday.
According to the Mic report on Friday morning, some demonstrators in the Senate corridor skated “November” because despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the Republican Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to jump in an amazing way", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“ A lot of people say it's been very high before, and that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the unsure women in the outskirts and young people (18-29 years) who are not enthusiastic about the president, they are often not going to vote."
The analysts were already presumed to return to the Republicans before the public confession of Ford, if they continue to stand by the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in his statement why he accused the supreme prosecutor of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was mistaken” said the NBC News at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Commission.
"This is not only about the vote on the Commission and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and the way they acted with Ford," said Guy Cecil, the US Director of Priorities for the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have quite shared their beliefs in Ford or Kavanaugh's statements as true, and Kavanaugh believes little more than Ford.
On the basis of a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents fully or more believed in Ford's statement, while 35% of respondents gave the same response than Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents say Kavanaugh probably lied to his statement, while only 30% of Ford's respondents believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently examining the authenticity of Ford's claims, as Kavanaugh's other accuser, Deborah Ramirez's claims, writes the Guardian.
Ford confessed a week ago to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was drunkenly harassing him when he was 17 years old.
According to Ramirez, the supreme court candidate showed him his sexual body at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The World Network Inventor will launch a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launches the launch to make it possible to pick up the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where to store your data and who can access your information.
In his exclusive interview to Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking about the fact that the Inrupt's intention was to "make the world's rule."
“We have to do it now, ” she said about the start.
– This is a historic moment."
The application, using Solid technology, enables people to create their own "personal online data base", called POD.
This may include lists, mission lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online database, it is unique that the user can decide who has access to the data in full.
This is what the company calls the "implementation of the right of self-regulation of persons to data".
John Bruce, according to Inrupt's Director General, the company's task is to ensure resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working in the project or a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onward, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask the “Facebook and Google to take into account the technology that brings a complete change, which would set companies’ business models from one day to another entirely at the top of the top of the business models.”
"We don't ask permission from them."
Berners-Lee, published on Saturday at the Medium, wrote that the Inrupt “provision of commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has participated in the debates on the neutrality of the Internet as an important opinion generator.
Despite the inrupt launch, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am undoubtedly optimistic about the next age of the world network", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann was celebrated in the first world war of Viktoria
The only Victoria Cross was celebrated by his hometown of England for 100 years after he executed his heroic work in the first world war.
Bernard Vann was honored and vice general in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never learn that he deserved the highest honor of the British armed forces.
Two grandchildren of the memorial celebration for his honor were covered at the Saturday ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire county.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the memorial stone was handed over exactly after his 100 years of grandpa's decoration.
According to the London Gazette, Bernard Vann was to be respected and vice-coloned on 29 September 1918, he passed his flag on the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel “in the middle of a dense fog and a heavy cannon and a machine gunfire”.
Later, he rushed to the face, and he stood on the edge of the flag shelf with “outspiritual heroicness, ” and then he attacked one by himself a camp cannon specialization, disposing of three members.
On 4 October 1918, Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper – only a month before the end of the war.
"I know I can never get to what my grandfather did and that taught me humiliation," said his grandfather, the 72-year-old Michael Vann.
Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were crushed after the orchestra led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was honored to play a role in the ceremony and added: “A true hero’s vigilance is proof of how many people express their respect later. ”
The OCTs have been wandering all night to watch the bellator 206, instead of the Peppa pig.
Imagine that all night she woke up to see the exciting Bellator 206, and that's what's missing.
At the San José show, there were 13 confrontations, six of which were broadcast in live nights as part of the main show in the United Kingdom, Channel 5 channel.
At 6:00 in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the British viewers did not surprise the game instead of the Peppa pig.
This was hardened by many who stayed up for hours this morning because of this collision.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans took off a child cartoon for some kind of sick joke on Twitter.
“National legislation states that such content can no longer be transmitted by the channel at 6:00 a.m., and therefore they had to change to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, head Vice-President of Bellator’s communication and marketing department in connection with the provision.
"Yes, it's Peppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator company, promised that in the future they would revise the schedule of the program to take into account the United Kingdom viewers.
Coker said, “I think we can solve this by repeating.
– However, since it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is on Monday, we can't cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show turned on, a lot of messages were received, and so most of them weren't quite friendly.
First of all, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But that wasn't what we were talking about, but we got into a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
Instead of the six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we would have liked to make it to the audience, but we counted ourselves.
There was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with minority complex
Tom Daley's masterpiece at the Olympics said that when he was young, he felt lower than anyone he had sexual orientation, but that's what made him feel motivated to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like him" until high school.
In the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme, Lauren Laverne told the programme director that he would stand up for the gay rights to give others hope.
He added that since he became a parent, he's much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent programme director of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has missed several months due to disease.
Daley invited Laverne in his first show as a "boat burglar" to say that as a young person, he felt like "lower" than anyone else, because "coherence was not accepted if someone loved boys and girls."
He stated: “To date, the feeling of subordinatedity and kindness is what I am drawing up with endurance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” to avoid disappointing everyone when he was exposed to sexual orientation.
The double Olympic bronze jump became a publicly recognized representative of the LMBT community and, using its role in the national community games organised in Australia, asked the world's governments to decriminate homosexuality in all countries.
He said he called me on the case because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he would have wanted to give him hope.
The three-fold world champion said that the situation was "very surprising" when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance, the first American filmmaker he met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-judge writer married last year, and he claims that the age difference never meant a problem among them.
“If a man is going through so many things when he was young,” he said, “the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died in cancer three years later,” he found something like extreme experiences in his own age class.
In June of the couple, he adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and according to Daley's own statement, it completely turned his attitude towards the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said, the most important thing is to win the gold medal, ” he said.
There are more important things than my Olympic gold prize.
My Olympic gold coin Robbie."
The name of the child became Robert after Daley's father, who died when he was 40 years old after a brain tumor was diagnosed.
According to Daley's statement, his father did not want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already available for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I was incredibly pleased to answer him that “Dad, you will no longer be in the first line” he quoted.
"I had my hands on him when he stopped breathing, but until the moment I couldn't accept that my father was not insecure," he said.
The following year, Daley attended the Olympics in 2012 and acquired the bronze.
“I realized that this is what I've dreamed about all my life: jumping on the Olympic Games in front of a home audience, there's no better feeling than that,” he said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Byske) helped him in the preparation of the Olympics, and until today, he's going to be a hamster if he hears it.
Desert Island Discs begins on Sunday, local time at 11:15 on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he went to the bar on Saturday at the Ryder Couple.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by participating in the 47th coupon game on the Ryder Coupa Sunday, but you must win its form back if you do not want this milestone to remain unpleasant in your memory.
Mickelson plays the record 12 times every two years at the event, because of the performance of the four-ball Saturday and four-game games, Jim Furyk sent it to the team captain.
Instead of having five winners at the center of events in big competitions, as many times when they had to fight for the United States' victory, now in one half of the day, the team has been struggling, the other half of it's practicing and trying to correct the flaws that weaken his game.
Carrier's top was never one of the most precise hits, so the 48-year-old player is not really the close track of Le Golf National, where high grass is a very high price to pay for faulty hits.
And if the track alone isn't scary enough, Mickelson's Sunday, the ninth game will meet the English champion of Francesco Molinari, who won all the four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood as the beginner.
If the Americans that start with a four-point disadvantage before 12 individual matches start hard, Mickelson's game can be of crucial importance.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“You are fully aware of the role that you have played in today’s development, and you beat my back and clawed and promised you would be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- Very confident.
It's one of the biggest ones, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the last week.
Basically, I didn't plan two games for him.
I've planned more, but in this situation, we've decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
With Mickelson's role on Sunday, Nick Faldo's record is going to be ruined, and no one's ever played more games in the Ryder coup.
This allows you to close a series in the Ryder coup, which is far from the player's individual performance.
Mickelson could have 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven infinites, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the Veteran player would not have any conceived advantages for the team.
“ Vicces, sarcastic, spiritful, loves to play with others, a great team member, ” he explained.
– I think younger players also enjoyed playing games against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence outweighs the strict sense of the game."
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder coup, it's easy to turn his back on fortune.
The Danish player introduced it first in a 1997 valderrama match where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained five-point advantages against the Americans, and then they managed to keep a hairy advantage for the 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we have gained a great advantage in Valderrama, but we have won only one hairline, and we have a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn in the picture after the Fridays of Class 5-3 and yesterday’s win, which leads to Le Golf National track between 10 and 6.
– We have enough to think about the competitions of the previous years, and everyone is already seeing that the game is not over.
You're gonna have to play with a full twist tomorrow.
So let's go and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have the goal that is nothing but to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on now.
As I said before, I am mostly dealing with 12 players in our team, but we must also pay attention to the other side, who happen to be among the biggest players in the world."
Bjørn added proud of the team’s performance in the difficult field: “I would never be able to envision such a situation.
Tomorrow's a different pasta.
Then everything depends on the individual performance, which is completely different from the team game.
It's great to play in a couple when things go well, but when a person stands out individually, it's all about what golfer he really is.
That's what you need to understand with the players to bring the best out of you tomorrow.
They're gonna have to break up with their partner, who's gonna have to bring the best form too."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team, expressly trusts his players to perform better than in a couple, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points of the four.
Furyk has personally experienced both sides of the last day's resurrections: Brookline was a member of the winning team, and then the loser was on the side of the European team's "medinah miracle" mentioned after the brave performance.
“I remember all the damn words, ” she replied when she was asked, as she encouraged the players before the last day of the team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but we're going as fast as we could see in Brookline as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really fit into it, it puts a huge pressure on the players of the opponent during the middle games.
That's how we set the order and prepared our players to make a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to get the job to turn, and Rory McIlroy is playing the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next as the first half of the European team.
"I also decided on the order, because I think this is how the picture comes together from the beginning to the end of the day," added Bjørn to the individual act.
Once again, the shipment of Germany's new military ship has been postponed
The newest fregat of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War Army ships, but due to different system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for you for at least the next year.
The flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class fregats, the “Rheinland-Pfalz” admission was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the Die Zeit weekly newspaper quoted one of the spokespersons of the army.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy bond in 2014, but the ongoing delays have made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy still ordered the four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to the place of Bréma-class Age Fregats.
We know that there will be a large firearm cannon, and it will be equipped with missiles and disguise technology against various aircraft and watercraft, including a sign-reducer that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that there is fewer need for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest fregats can be put away from the parent ports for up to two years.
However, due to the continuation of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel power overseas, may have become obsolete when they are finally assigned to service, noted Die Zeit.
The heavy-fatal fregat F125 was covered last year when the German Navy officially rejected the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship ship back to the manufacturer.
There is not much information about the reasons for returning, but the German media has a number of critical "software and hardware" errors that make the warship unused in a battleship.
The software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 Marines will be served on Baden-Württemberg-class warships, which are only half of the crew of the old Bréma-class fregats.
It has also emerged that the ship is extremely overweight, which deteriorates its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
According to the 7000 tonnes Rheinland-Pfalz, it is allegedly twice as difficult as similar types of ships set up by Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty parts, the increase in the overall cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
Some sources show that the cost of the project has already reached the amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion ($ 3.6 billion), while the initial draft accounted for EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with new fregats are of particular importance in the light of the warning that the presence of Germany in the sea is in need.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the Navy is beginning to run out of military vessels.
According to the public officials, the problem has become a self-impressing process in the meantime, because the old ships had to be deployed, but there are no more ships that could replace the falls.
He expressed his concern about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregats could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats.
New research is carried out in a Scotland landscape, which aims to find out how bats are used to hunt landscape characteristics.
Researchers hope that the results can provide new information on the behaviour of single-aired mammals, which can also benefit from subsequent species protection initiatives.
Scientists of National Trust for Scotland will examine the behaviour of common and sophisticated smurf blood and brown long-coats and water bats in the area of Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
On the appropriate points of the area, special reception facilities are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
And NHS staff and volunteers will carry out mobile data collection with manual detectors.
Detailed analysis of the sound material of the records can determine the frequency of bats and what species is exactly what they do.
Researchers are also preparing a habitat map and report, which enables them to be detailed in order to determine how the behaviour of the animals is evolving depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Consultant, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats and which species uses them.
This information helps to determine the charity of livestock management work, such as the development of loops, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and other species concerned.
In the territory of Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations decreased significantly over the last century.
Buildings and regional development work will disturb animal sleeping sites and reduce their living space.
The wind turbines and public lighting also represent a risk factor for them, as are the attacks of fixed bean papers, certain chemical processes used for construction materials, as well as domestic cats.
The bats aren't exactly blind.
However, the night predator who was ours is much more reluctant to hear when they are hunting for the preacher, not for their sight.
They can determine the exact situation of insects and the terrain objects that come into their way using their sophisticated techniques based on the reversal of the ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings across the country, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleeping site studies and occasionally participate in rescue works.
The organization created Scotland's first and only dedicated battalion reservoir on the Threavebirds in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat trees.
David Thompson says the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here, inThreave there is a great place for bats,” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great."
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before buildings are renovated, because the destruction of a single establishment can result in the destruction of 400 females and young infants, which can lead to the death of the entire local population.
The law prohibits bats being protected by animals, their destruction, their harassment and the agitation of their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also requested the help of the population.
He said: “There are still many things we don’t know about bats, and we have almost no information on the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo confiscated charges on sexual violence against him, and he believes that others want to use his name to "become public consciousness".
Football attorneys are ready to sue the German weekly card Der Spiegel, which is the prosecution.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the warrior of Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to listen to the case, he wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo announced in an Instagram Live Video a few hours after the prosecution of 142 million fan camps that the news was "loyalty".
“No, no, no, no, and no.
The things that were brought together about me today are all a lie" said to the camera the five-fold gold ball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
It happens.
They want to become famous with my name, this is the life of public lovers.
I'm a happy person and my life is fine," said the player in a smile.
Because of all the claims that were called "unacceptable, infringing privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz's lawyer, the player will submit a claim to compensation for the damage caused by the moral damage to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in one of the Palms hotels and casinos in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athletic suite where the man assaulted a woman, they're in the papers submitted to the Clark county of Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo was on his knees after the case and told him that he was a "99 percent good boy", except "one percent".
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had established a sexual relationship with the woman, but he believed that all of this had been done with common consent.
Mayorga also argues that she went to the police, and she had a visit to a hospital about her injuries, but later she went into an extrajudicial agreement because she was “fearing the revenge, ” and “an obvious humiliation. ”
The 34-year-old woman would like to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life miserable.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was just before a reconciliation (from Real Madrid to the Manchester United team), and this summer the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will ‘forever’ treat the loss of automotive works
The United Kingdom will ‘behave forever’ if he loses his world-led car manufacturer position after Brexit, said Greg Clark Minister of Business.
He added that Toyota UK considers its statement to BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, it will be forced to temporarily stop production in the burnastonia factory near Derby.
"There is a need for the agreement", said Clark.
According to the Japanese automotive company, in the case of a non-contractual Brexit, there may be a loss of jobs due to delays in the borders.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis model factory manufactured 150 000 cars last year, with 90% exported to other Member States of the European Union.
“I see that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops in the factory” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that after Brexit, it would close Miniket’s Oxford plant for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risk associated with the supplier chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production hall is based on the "in-depth time", parts come from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, cross-border disturbances may lead to production delays and partial deficiencies, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store sufficient spare parts in Derbyshire for more than one day and should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, which is known as Theresa May Chequers, is "explicitly compiled to avoid delaying controls at the border."
“We need the agreement, and we want to agree on the best possible terms, not only to enjoy the fruits of our current success but also to offer new opportunities,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we definitely need to keep our highly successful supplier chain at the moment."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would last, but it warned that the computing costs could in the long term deteriorate the competitiveness of the factory, which could ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for 24 years in the burnastoni plant and is currently acting in the representation of the Unite Union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “My experiences show that we will never get back jobs that would end this time.
One government speaker said: "We have developed a prudent and feasible plan for future EU relations."
Once again, they can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting, announced by the White House
"You can postpone more than a week" Rod Rosenstein Deputy Attorney General and Donald Trump's meeting with a large scale, since the debate about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, issued the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of a special attorney Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence on elections, possible relations between Trump advisors and the Russian government, and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
In Washington, for months, they've been concealing whether Trump will eventually be killed by the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence.
According to this month's report by New York Times, Rosenstein considered that it would be able to record the discussion with the President, and the question was whether, on the basis of the amendment of the 25th constitution, Trump could be replaced.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
However, last Monday, she visited the White House, and she spoke about submitting her resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trumpp, whose presence was before the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he would not be “happy” to defeat Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed so that he would not face the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford were also witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the final senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We still have no designated date, even for this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I have some chance of delaying another one week.
Soon I'll find out, and, as always, I'll let the press know."
However, some journalists doubted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked me about this reason.
Sanders replied that the reason for the rareness of press conferences is not to resist the behavior of television reporters as a "Sensation Hair", but added: "I am not debating the fact that I am truly sensational."
It then suggested that direct meetings will take place more often between representatives of Trump and the press.
“The President interviews more questions than any former president,” he said.
Press releases will continue, said Sanders, but “If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is better with light years than to talk to me.
We are often trying to find this line, and in the past few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so you can speak to the President of the United States personally instead of the white house press conferences."
Trump will regularly answer the reporters' questions when leaving the White House or in public events, perhaps attend the press conferences with visitors.
However, the press conferences held alone are quite rare.
Why, it might be suggested that this week, when the president was provocating a bizarre role in New York, in front of the gathered journalists.
The head of the health wallet sent a letter to the EU employees of NHS Scotland for the concerns of Brexit
The head of the health wallet stated in a letter the country's thanks to its employees from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom is expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of decentralised EU citizens' claims for status in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations on the exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which is expected to take a decision in the fall.
The UK Government has also agreed to prepare a scenario without any agreement.
I am aware of the worrying period this may be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.
Employees from different EU Member States and other countries help with valuable experiences and expertise in the work of the health wallet, which also has a positive impact on patients and communities we serve.

The Tennessee State Tigers linebackeren, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after a battle with 31-27 defeats against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ Tennessee on Saturday.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He walked to the coastline and just collapsed", said Reed.
The coach team and the healthcare staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field and then put it on bed and took it to further investigations.
One of the Tennessee State's authorities in Nashville of Tennessee told Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter that Abercrombie is beyond the surgery that was carried out at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “you do not know further details about the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the first season of the second-year student who was resting for a year, will be spent in the Tennessee State team to which Illinois has certified.
On Saturday, he presented five successful equipment before he left the track, so he's already on the 18th season.
Foreign purchasers will have to pay higher fees for real estate purchased in the United Kingdom
On the basis of the new Toryk plan, foreign purchasers will have to pay higher taxes after real estate purchased in the United Kingdom and would support the homeless with the additional income resulting from this.
With this step, I would neutralize Corbyn's successes among young voters
Increasing the levy aims at those not taxing in the United Kingdom
According to the State Treasury, this would mean 120 million pounds of revenue per year, which would be used to support the homeless
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees after real estate purchased in the United Kingdom, and the additional income resulting from this will be used to support the homeless, and will be informed of Theresa May at a press conference today.
The objective of the action is to counterbalance the successes that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved among young voters, which has achieved by proposing more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the levy affects individuals and companies not taxed in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue resulting from it will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional charge added to the current levy, which may be higher than the higher tax on second apartments two years ago and for real estate purchased for expenditure, even three per cent.
The State Treasury expects a revenue of GBP 120 million per year following the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by non-United Kingdom citizens, causing a significant price increase, which makes the situation of the first residents becoming increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich districts in the country have become a “spiritual city”, especially in the capital, because many foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new proposal for a law came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees to help young people who are waiting for their first home.
He is personally responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which has become the custom of purchasing and leaving the sites. May was asked to erase quotas for affordable houses and to start with something that was created in the country as a “dishonor of the housing market”.
Corbyn has submitted remarkable proposals on the series of housing reforms, including the elimination of rent control and thorough undue removals.
In addition, it would provide councils with more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “In general I said that I would like to devote my Prime Minister to restore the English dream and to make life more and better for each generation.
It is therefore necessary to settle the situation on the real estate market.
Britain remains open, as always, for those who want to live here, work and establish a family.
However, it is not right that individuals outside the country and companies with foreign interest can buy real estate as easily as hard-working English citizens.
The dreams from their own home have become almost inaccurate to many people, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: “I want to become the manager of the Scottish team”
Jack Ross, the coach of Sunderland, says that "the greatest desire" is to be the head of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scotland coach would be pleased to meet the challenges that the North-East club is raised, which is currently in the third position of the first-class league, with only three points below the first place.
He then transferred his seat to the Stadium of Light baptized stadium after he successfully returned his team of St. Mirren to the first-class Scotland football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserves – Ross said in the Scotland BBC Sportssound.
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scotland team game in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled back to them.
Now, however, I only have the chance to succeed as a club manager."
Among the predecessors of Ross, the manager of Sunderland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not excited because he has to enter the prints of such great names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“The success at this moment is to determine whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the location of the first-class league, he said.
– It will not be easy to get back, but more than likely, I will only consider my activity here as a success if I can get the club back."
Ross manager's career started just three years ago after he worked as a deputy coach for a while with the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months at his coach at Hearts.
Then Aola helped to stand on his feet after the team relapsed into the third grade, and St. Mirren, on the edge of the fall, received the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels much more confident now than he's ever been in his game run, either Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical team.
“It was the right time,” he mentioned the period of training as Alloa.
– Clearly, I thought management was more like me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done a good job, I've had some really memorable moments of my life.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very tough.
There's a lot of things to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the work with stress and pressure, but the management tasks lie to me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel like I'm the best in my skin in my entire age."
The entire interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel by local time from 12:00 to 13:00 in Sportsound's Sunday 30 September.
A study says the beer falls best at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
In summer thermal waves, there has been a significant increase in the traffic of bottles in England in difficulty, but there is still a lot of pressure on restaurant chains.
Based on the data collected, the income of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but decreased by 4.8% in restaurants.
Peter Martin, employee of the CGA business advisory company compiling statistics, stated: “With the solar season and the longest role in the world championship expected in England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when the pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in income, with the difference that a further decline could be observed than restaurants.
The decline in income of restaurants by 1.8% in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars, mostly alcohol traitors, were the best performers who produced more growth than even the loss of restaurants.
The pubs offering more than food have been uncomfortablely affected by the durable sunshine, although it is not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people prefer to drink at this time.
The income of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% in this month and the income from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst of leisure and hospitality, says: “These results follow the trend since the end of April.
The weather and major community and sport events continue to be the main source of income for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult position, and the reduction in the annual 4.8% revenue may become particularly painful due to continuous cost pressure.
The long, hot summer of restaurants for operators would not have come worse, and it will only be time to find out if the lesser weather in August will also bring relief in this area."
The total increase in income for pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slowing rate of introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the United Kingdom’s catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) as a widely accepted industrial scale, collects and analyses the performance data of a group of operators with over 9 billion total turnover of 47 members.
Of five children have social media branches hidden from their parents
According to a survey, a child of five has (may be 11 years old) social media figures secreted from parents and teachers
According to a survey conducted by a 20 000 high school survey, the number of Insta sites is increasing
Fear of Sexual Contents Is Enriched From the News
20% of students responded to having a "major" account that your parents can see
A child from five creates a social media account that is secret from adults (because he is 11 years old).
According to a survey of 20 000 high schools, the number of Insta-alcohols is rapidly increasing, which refers to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students responded that they have an unmaculated "major" account that their parents can see, but they also create private drawers.
A mother who accidentally showed up on the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teen - year - old profile in which she said, “Assault me.”
According to the research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have recognised that they have private branches.
“I find it concerned that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said the head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "sporters' voice" in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected not to be the Executive Director of the Scottish Athletic Alliance at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
According to Doyle Scotland's most effective athletics, the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, will be an invaluable help to the decision-makers of sports for the last decade.
"Elidh is a huge esteem in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletic community, and his presence will help to develop the athletics of Scotland", said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I was pleased to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold coins of American athletes who regularly acquainted on BBC acquired at 200 metres and 400 metres in the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circumvention disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I received stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me if I'd be able to fix it at all in time.

Thank you for all your encouraging messages."
Breast absorber advertising like cows shares the online community
A strong online debate has been launched by a company producing tits cleaners, which compared breast-feeding mothers to head steak.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first quiet, portable bra”, and the appearance of their products was advertised in an ironic advertisement that quotes musical videos, which presented the freedom that the device gives to mothers with milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a cow-wheel-full cow-wheel, while in the background the following songs can be heard: "Yes, I'm headed, I'm not even dicked," and "If I didn't show up, they're not tits, but my boobs."
And the rephen sounds like, "I pump, I pump that the child eats big, pumps, pumps, I punch the chicks."
Advertisement published on the company's Facebook page soon entered into a cross-wind of debates online.
The video reached 77 000 views, and hundreds of joint receptions were received. Many people say that advertising is confused by the dairy of the dairy industry.
“To advertise the product with very flavorless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life to their offspring, but their calves will be taken away from them in days," reminds one of the commentators.
Elvie breast vacuum is discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and calf.
But why don't we use them to sell a breast sucker to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: “Advertisement is completely insensitive. ”
Others have come to the protection of advertising, a woman admits that the video is "badly funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would've bought it right if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant" – he wrote.
Another commentary says: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who have milk in their workplace or in a toilet who feel like a cow for this.
The dairy industry does not glorify or judge."
At the end of the video, women show me that during the dance, they had a discreet breast-smelling in their bra all the time.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women using the breast suckers sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is silent, does not apply wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast bra, so women can move freely, hold their children, or even move out during breast sucking.
Ana Balarin, the mother’s co-owner and communication director, says: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it was a bold, provocative advertisement.
In parallel with women heading their milk and head steak, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges facing the use of breast suckers and the funny way to detect the feeling of freedom that our breast sucker offers in comparison with this."
The Elvie's bra didn't get into the news first.
A two - child mother, Marta Jakubowski, entered the runway in the fashion week of London.
Hundreds of young migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child-old migrants held in custody, while the number of crossings of the month has not changed much. This is partly explained by the harsh rhetoric of the Trump Administration and its measures so far to find more hosting homes.
Includingly, the recipients themselves are illegal immigrants, and fearing that they would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they applied for the reception of children.
This threat grew further in June when parents applying to the receiver and adults living in a household need to give fingerprints and share these data with the Immigration Authorities.
Matthew Albence, headquarter of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Immigration and Customs Office), acknowledged in his statement before the Congress last week that there were dozens of people arrested for the reception of unaccompanied minors.
The Office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were unpunished.
“ 80% of applicants and those living with them are illegally resident in the country and a significant proportion of criminals convicted.
Therefore, we continue looking for such individuals," Albence declared.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced that a part of them should appear before the court within a month of detention instead of 60 days, social workers are appointed.
Many people register in the court for a video conference instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressive children will be, and the chance of violent outbreaks or attempts to escape will increase.
According to lawyers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility like the tornados, where it is more difficult to detect psychological care needs due to the number of children.
They added that if they don't give children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they move them to a facility like this, they're making them even more traumatic.
Syria has called for immediate departure from the American, French and Turkish “arrival forces”
Mr Walid al-Moualem, spoken before the UN General Assembly, was asked to return to their country in spite of the 8th civil war in the country.
Moualem, the Vice-President of the Prime Minister, also claimed that foreign forces entered the Syrian area illegally referring to the fight against terrorism, and “this way they will be treated.”
“They must withdraw at the same time and without conditions” said the Assembly.
Moualem stated that "the war against terror will soon end" in Syria, where over 360 000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their home since 2011.
He stated that Damascus “continues his holy fight to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from the terrorist groups and “the unlawful foreign presence”.
The United States' 2000 soldiers reside in Syria, as a trainer and advisor of most of them, help the Kurds Forces and the Arab militias fighting Bassar against El-Assad.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country of war.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem claimed that the circumstances are appropriate for their return and that only 'some Western countries' are curtailing 'irradic fears', alarming refugees from returning home.
“We requested the international community and humanitarian organisations to help people return home,” he stated.
– Politics have been made of a purely humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid for reconstruction will be provided to Syria until political agreement is reached between Assad and its opposition on the conclusion of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a counterpart for the last great survivors around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the Syrian governmental forces supported by the Russians from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three million inhabitants.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement sets "explicit deadlines" and indicated its hope that military action would only target jihadists, including an-Nus Front linked to the Al-Kaidda, which would be "developed in a good way".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of representatives of the government and opposition can be convened soon, which is responsible for preparing the Syrian Constitution after the war and preparing the elections.
Among Moualem's conditions, the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, for example, is only acceptable to “revise certain articles of the current Constitution” and protects all external actors from interference.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trumpot.
Following this logic, Trumpot will certainly be re-elected in 2020 unless many of its liberal viewers' hopes are fulfilled, and a responsibility procedure or a scandal will not end its presidency before the time.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic finale of all time.”
For now, however, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's main-time view has increased to nearly double, and MSNBC's views have been nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million people in the main showtime instead of 1.7 million years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC is the most viewed cable year show with its 3.5 million audience, which comes to the nights of the major news.
“It attracts us as a fire, because something we don’t understand” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of the ABC “A designated survivor”.
Nell Scoovell Veteran Venice Player, author of the “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has different opinions.
This is how he recalls a bostonian taxi trip before the 2016 election:
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why" – asked Scovell.
"Because she laughed," said the driver.
It's chaos' fun power.
In contrast to television series, of course, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade-precedens to reunification of immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
It's just a very narrow layer that can help you not to care about these facts.
However, it is no longer a part of the responsible information when we have been staring at a debate show in which the authenticity of the anonymous background discussions used in the book Bob Woodward "Fatal" or Paul Manafort's 15-hour structive jacket (the body's dressed as arrogance according to the wording of The Washington Post) or the consequences of Stormy Daniels Trump's description of his anatomy.
As for me, that's what I'm going to remember about Super Mario from now on.
“A little bit of a feeling of a reality show, where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the author of the "Greek Stars", who keeps changing the players in Trump's show, and the new turns are coming every day (this is how the N.F.L. starts complimenting Kim Dzsongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it right away.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunshine time in Kauain, yet he was in there looking at MSNBC in his house, recording his CNN show.
He couldn't break off TV as Brett Kavanaugh started his hearing at the Senate Justice Committee, where he was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many said this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss pointed out.
"I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right."

Both parties put money in the most frequent competitions in the mid-term congress election.
No one was surprised that in the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania, both parties spent money indefinitely after the recast of the Congress districts, two active representatives are fighting for the same chair.
One of the competitors for the recently rebuilt Pittsburgh premiere is the Democrat Conor Lamb, who last spring acquired a mandate at an interim election.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a former representative of Pennsylvania's 12 electoral district, showing a significant overlap with the 17th district today.
The map had to be recast after the Court of Supreme Court in Pennsylvania concluded in January that the previous district limits were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties' funding body, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) were almost licensing each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name was known in Pennsylvania after winning the March interim election in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade, the Members of the Republicans, Donald Trump, won the district for 20 exact benefits.
Political experts say that the democrats are somehow more likely to win.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then abandoned the plan.
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington was hardly responding to.
In June 2017, Donald Trump negotiated with the President of Juan Carlos Varela in Panama, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization leader's team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back the chief colleagues of American posts from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of their “practical decision that they do not support Taiwan” earlier announced Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars of American aid in 2017, including as aid to combat drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as reducing financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As closed meetings continued, North and Central America's competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In the middle of September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not wish to punish El Salvador.
They announced that Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to the diplomats, indicates the importance of the administration of the event.
The three U.S. sent quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue criminal statements and unlawfully imprisoned criminal measures.
John Bolton's white speaker did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by the three American officials, including two diplomats.
Their reporters were supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next strike could be Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's report to see if Trump had prevented justice in any way.
According to Mueller's investigation, it also covers whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are made to a majority in the Congress, they will certainly try to take up Trumpot, who may have to face his political judgement after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as it is not of European comrades.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how much the fight will go.
In 1938 many German officers were ready to kiss Hitler, waiting for the West to stand next to the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
The support has been lost, so it has not been possible to prevent bloodshed for the following years.
It falls on historical points like this that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been running since last year, when, as our newspaper has reported, he suggested to record the discussions with the President and has asked Trump to complete his inadequate office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and is appointed as a member of the Supreme Court despite a credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is, in the interim election, are we voting for a Congress that is ready to take Trumpot?
If we fail these trials, democracy stands in front of a long winter.
I trust that it won't happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once sat in the building for my ambassador home.
My mother survived the holocaust, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on the table of the swamp sign during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimist about our future?"

The Graham Dorrans at the Rangers is confident in the fight against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The Austrian victory can provide them with their participation in the European League G group after the unpredictable end of the Spanish Villarreal.
Graham Dorrans' knee injury in the middleway did not allow him to go to the 2-2 fights against Villarreal in the season, but he feels that, building on this result, Rangers could also choose more daring goals.
“It was an important point for a great team against Villarreal, ” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could get a point, and we brought a point.
Maybe at the end of the day we could've pulled up another goal, but we can't complain to the end.
In the first half time, they were better, and in the second half, we switched to it.
The Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were pretty good at their previous game, but our cheerleaders behind our backs will certainly have the strength to win.
Last year was pretty difficult, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now it's very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, they're good at training.
I hope that if we put everything in it, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
Many women are worried that they don't save enough for their old age
Participants in the survey had accurate ideas of the age care they wanted, but only a small part of them spoke to their family members about this.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents argued with their spouse the expected costs of their old age care.
Only 10% of them responded to talking about this with their children.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and your children: You cannot expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell us what your needs are.
They are chosen together with their counselling and family, where and what kind of care they want; these decisions have a significant impact on the later costs.
Take a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can take place with traditional insurance bonds designed for old-age care or with a hybrid savings life insurance that can cover the expenses or use its own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources.
Prepare the legal documentation: so they cut the possibility of subsequent trial in advance.
Trust a representative, a trustworthy person who works in your name on health issues, will supervise his medical care and ensure that everything happens according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to deal with your finances.
This reliable person makes the necessary financial decisions and provides for payment of the accounts when you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Please note that your elderly parent has been in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
Such data shall be recorded in writing to be available at any time.
“It is not just financial issues that need to be clarified, but it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance."

Earthquakes and Runners in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives when a great earthquake was on Friday, and then a fugitive smashed down to the city of Palu in Indonesia.
The communication network of the region is also injured, and so far no news has been received from the Government Donggala, which is north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 people had to evacuate in Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the Central Celebes Province of Palu, on the west coast of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 people in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city's foundation when the earthquake and the escape price fell upon it.
Governance Donggala is over 300 km away from the northwest coast of Celebes.
In 2017, the population of the government, a lesser administrative region, was approximately 299 200 people.
Central Celebesre is primarily a characteristic of fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but is concentrated primarily in Morowal, Celebes overseas.
According to the Indonesian Catastrophe Surveillance Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by the fugitive price for the past 100 years.
A 1938 fleet was killed by over 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, western Donggalla was hit by a fleeing price, then nine were killed.
Indonesia is located in the area of the earthly active Pacific Fire ring, so earthquakes are common.
Only some of the major earthquakes and fleet prices in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a massive sea drift began on the west coast of the North Sumatra Aceh Province, which launched a fleet of 14 countries, demanded a total of 226 000 lives along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: The Western coast of Sumatra was shaken by the series of strong vibrations between the end of March and the beginning of April.
On the island of Nias, near Sumatra, hundreds of people died.
2006: A 6.8-strong trembling struck the southern part of the island of Java, the largest population of Indonesia, and nearly 700 victims of the fleet on the southern coast.
2009: 7-6 earthquake destroyed near Padang, the capital city of the Western Sumatra province.

Earthquake and escaper in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes in Indonesia.
The 7.5 earthquake created a fountain that destroyed thousands of residential houses.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunication have become inoperative, and the number of dead will probably increase in the next few days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, from the capital of Indonesia to the northeast of Jakarta.
In social media, a number of videos were published on the arrival of the fleeing price.
On the coast of Palu, hundreds of people gathered together at a celebration, and that's when the beach hits.
The federal attorneys have requested a death penalty for suspects of terror attack in New York City.
New York's U.S. Attorneys are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspects of eight human lives in New York City, who have not been executed since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov accused him to drive a truck rented from Home Depot in October on a bike trip on the street of Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, hit a number of pedestrians and bicyclers.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and has been injured by the South District of New York.
According to the file submitted, evidence of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-orthical blackmail murders, which were used almost exclusively against organised crime, and the destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and foreseen intentions", states the prosecutors, and Saipov, in their words, carried out in a "surprising, cruel, inhuman" way.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco” – it is presented.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District of New York has been asking for a death penalty for a prosecutor for the last decade.
Khalid Barnest was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life-end prison.
In the Federal case in New York, the last sentence was executed in 1953, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the married couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown any repentance in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was pleased to have done it.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, they're on the prosecution.
According to the police, he asked to put an ISIS in his hospital room.
He both confessed himself innocent in 22 prosecutions.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “understandably disappointed” for the decision of the prosecutors.
“We believe that the actual life-end freedom loss for confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty only extends the suffering of all the parties involved in the case,” says Patton.
Saipov's lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty for their defendant.
Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage at the demonstration during the Tory Conference stated that he “invites the army of the people to battle. ”
According to the former Ukip leader, politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of the parties to Theresa May has raised that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to Farage.
The Conservative Peter Bone, who did not complete any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have ‘no longer left’ if Farage was the Minister for Brexit.
It is well characterized by the pressure within the Mayre, that Toryk, the remainder Party, was spoken in another demonstration against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires the permanent recession between Brexit and the remainder parties and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose from his package or “full chaos”.
Bone at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull (the exit means we're leaving) said that the “Chequers” should be counted.
It was suggested that Farage be raised to the House of Lords and that it should be entrusted to the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had led the negotiations, we would have quit."
Mr Wellingborough added: “I thank you next to Brexit, but the Chequers will have to be counted."
In criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption. Since the vote in 2016, the public opinion has changed: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and want to stay.”
The representative of the Brexit Party tory Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and said to the journalists: “That’s all I ask: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers initiative rejects the public opinion, the opponent will not vote, the party is unpopular, and mostly the activists who work in the field and helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
He added as a corner message to May: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his chair that keeps his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “sensibly feel the pressure”, so that they would not dare betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between our people and our politicians has now been expressed”
– They want to sell Brexit, and today we've gathered together to send you a message, we won't let them do it."
With these words, he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I would love if our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit felt pressure.
We call the army of the people to win with the Brexit and not rest until we make the United Kingdom again an independent, independent, proud country."
In the meantime, the remainder parties went to Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Some of the activists were formed on the weekend by the flag of the "Toryk against Brexit" movement.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party lived on the conservatives because of the security errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people said that they had the IT background for a Canadian plus-plus agreement, a border-free movement agreement with Ireland, and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders.
- They're just talking to you.
It is simply not a good Brexit" – stressed.
Warren "reasonably" to take action for the presidency

The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was a meeting with the electoral citizens in 36th Forum of the population since Trump took office.
A Participant asked if he was planning to take off the presidential election.
In Warren's reply, he said that it was time for women to “become involved in rehabilitating the misguided government in Washington, including the seizure of the highest position”.

The Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a man was arrested on Friday by the shooting of a basketball player in LSU, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police captain announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the 20-year press conference at 11 noon.
They used to publish a video about the Friday shooting, and they asked for help identifying the man on the tape.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the World Championship, after the team retirement he gained victory before Sebastian Vettel
After the Valtteri Bottas qualified himself for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became immediately clear that Mercedes' instructions will play a major role in my run.
The Bottas, who started out of no position, started well and almost put Hamilton in trouble because he defended his position in the first two circles, which enabled Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vett stood in the bust and let Hamilton crawl behind the middle field, which he should have proved to be decisive.
Mercedes stood a round later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came after a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner curve free after he moved twice as a defense in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the launch cubes, and it was seventh at the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race because he didn't change tyres so he could quickly target and prevent Kimi Räikkön in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, he stood in the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight circles he couldn't increase his speed, so Räikköne became the fourth place.
“It was almost a day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a true gentleman when he was instructed to let go.
The team achieved exceptional work to get the first two seats", Hamilton said.
His body speech was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a new member of the Supreme Court for sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee, but noted, the things in Senate prove that people are “religious, disgusting and liars”.
“What can happen, and what has happened in the last few days of the Senate when you see the rage when you see people angry, malicious, hateful and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the leakages, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... You leaked the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Well, let's just stop for a second.
What were we leaking?... no, we didn't leak" he said, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent to Feinstein in July and leaked out at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein denyed that the source of leakage was his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims and I didn't leak out his story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill's report.
"You asked me to handle it confidentially, and I also handled it confidentially in accordance with your request."
However, it seems that the President did not accept his denial, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I tell you what the situation is: his body speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it out, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by the three women to use the alleged accusations for their own purpose.
“They are determined to have any means, but they will regain power.
You can see the maliciousness, the disgustingness, they do not care who they are hurt, who must pass through to gain power and control," quoted the President's words, Mediaite.

Is it a black one again?
Nancy in New York has sued a party for dismissal after a "rassist" message
A New York-i male lit up for the dismissal of a few who were discriminating against him, after the mother complained that they were able to apply "a black" again.
The couple denys that they're racists, and the trial is like a "crimination".
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when in 2016 the new child carer, Giselle Maurice, saw that she was black on the first working day.
“NEEEEEEEM, I DIDN'T THROUGH,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after he's awakened, Plasco-Flaxman, who's unintended, dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing male, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, rather than expecting a philiphino.
Ms. Maurice's work was paid for the same day and then a Uber was sent home.
Maurice is now suing the party for resignation and is asking for $35 per day compensation for the inhabitant work for the six-month period for which it was originally hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the road, you can’t do that,” said the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims accusing them of racism that the termination of Maurice was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after they were infringed.
“My wife sent him something that he didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust someone who was rude to by any chance?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, according to the case, she had only two months ago born the baby and was “very difficult. ”
“Will someone attack that?
It's not really a good thing to do that," said the investment banker.
While the legal procedure is under way, the court of the public opinion has already condemned the party quickly in the media of the Community, by detrimental to their behaviour and their logic.
According to a letter that we have just found, Paddington's publisher was afraid that the readers would not be able to connect to a talker bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, commented on the letter: “There is someone who is looking for us to read first before his publication.
This information is quite fun now when we know how much success Paddington is."
According to his father, who worked as a BBC operator, before he felt inspiration for writing a little childbook about a game bear, would not have been troubled if his work had been rejected, and added that his 60th anniversary of the book was a bitter success after his father died last year.
Paddington was called “a very important member of his family”, and added, his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t even imagined,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real for him, he was like a child who takes him to something: we are proud of it even if it wasn’t really our merit.
I think you saw Paddington's success somehow.
Although he created it and made it out of his imagination, he always attributed success to himself as the merit of Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her bye through the phone.

“They regularly called me to tell you that she was in a very bad state and that she wasn’t expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then they gave me a call from Nad telling me that in the next two minutes my daughter will die and I have to thank him.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep his heart throwing, they ran out slowly and then left his body.
He's already dead, and that's when everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait until it was over.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, when she was mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the others who didn't care about the trial she's been through.
"No one knew", he said.
“ I drove my head down, and my tears shook all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there on the plane, I felt this all overly sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."

Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up cards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a walesi bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he became depressed and then committed suicide when he was 18 years old.

The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and his vigilance was stuck on everyone.
“He knew about everyone’s smile.
They always said that his smile would put up any place."
But before he died, he gave up his work because he was “very bad.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own self, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that this would cause some domino effect. ”
Ms. David made the cards for that purpose, “so that people know, there are people who can be asked and spoken to them, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit still – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who for years lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend, Mark, who was a life mate for 15 years, just after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed or anything,” he said.

He broke our hearts into pieces.
But we have to continue fighting."

The future of the questionable Brett Kavanaugh, as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve what he requested – a limited-term, limited-scale investigation – maybe we could agree", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee held a "dead" because of the party's inconclusiveness.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their opposition is only due to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expecting to fail, it will be much more difficult for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby at them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also recognized his wife through him, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases your report?
The Senate holds a vote where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow the vice president Mike Pence to take a decision to put Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea dissidencies under the control of Kim
The number of North Korean disidents to South Korea has declined since Kim Jungun has been in power seven years, and a South Korean lawmakers have declared that he has been in power.
Park Bjengök quoted the data of the Southern Ministry of Merger and said that the last year was 1127 dissidents against 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said that the tighter border guards between North Korea and China and higher penalties for traffickers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information in public.
Most of the North Disidents will eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing to China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitrate Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are taken by China as an illegal immigrant and not as a refugee, and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is practically still in war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leader of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the heart of their discussion, the closed nuclear disarmament negotiations were held.
This historic meeting in June took place between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dzsongun in Singapore, where they agreed on further cooperation on the Unarmed Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the American sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, our national security is not a source of confidence, and in such circumstances we cannot unilaterally dismantle our weapons,” Ri said in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "histerian", he said he was inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh as a "histerian" and claimed that his conduct was not in line with the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in an interview, so in the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought unwillingly that if a woman acted like this, I would call it “histerian”, he explained Pelos’ response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh's sentiments to protest against the celebrity that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost shouted, and his voice shut down when he talked about his years of family and high school.
In addition, he specifically condemned the democrats of the committee, the accusations against him called "grotesk and coordinated character murder", and the defeat of Hillary Clinton during the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not suitable for his work at the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I believe that he excluded himself from his statements and his behavior against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when they asked if he would try to take Kavanaugh into account, in case he fills the post, and if the Democrats acquire a majority in the House.
"I'm telling you that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where you are right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judiciary at the capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that he was concerned as a democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Law on Reliable Provisions or Roe vs Wade, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court and expects us to be ripped out of joy,” said Pelosi.
And women need to keep in touch.
It's a legitimate runaway, a rage that's been raging on the surface for months and years, and it can't be released without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", she told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so rare, right?"
“I had help with a woman who was working in a leading position somewhere,” she continued. “He said to me that she was angry too, but he developed a technique that when she started crying in anger, she said to her conversation partner: ‘You may think I'm sad because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they were basically misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories of my early work, a manly office, where I once started crying in my angry inability, that I was grabbed by an older woman – a cool manager, who I always feared – and took me to the stairs.
“Don’t let them see cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they managed to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, former Democrat Congressman from Colorado, Gary Harttal, worked on the campaign of presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an outside marriage with the hair called Monkey Business, and that's why she fell out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, she figured out that there was no reason why she couldn't go to the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” she laughed to me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidate was wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone called "White and Seven Smurfs."
Since it's been a long time since the campaign, Ms. Schroeder's been missing with the money collection, so he said he's not going to compete unless he's picking up the $2 million.
He was a battle to be defeated.
He found out some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“You thought I was going to get a discount?” he was meditated.
When she held a press conference that would not launch a formal campaign, the emotions were so overthrowded because of the thanks to the people who supported her, and the fact that the money was collected and the system that directly affected the achievement of the voters, the frustration and the rage of sexism, that her throat was obsolete.
“They believed I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, how the press reacted.
“They believed the Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?
"Crying"?
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening of the US-China trade war was almost ear-drying, and while the battle was not nearly over, the break between countries, according to experts, can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warnings by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, since the new customs duties have already covered a product of USD 200 billion, which is practically taxing half of the goods from China to the USA.
In any case, Beijing has recovered a customs duty of between five and ten percent, which has been imposed on an American product of USD 60 billion.
China accepted that every time it would strike back, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not retreat in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to retreat, it would mean you have to give the leak before the claims, but the public bowing to the US would be too awkward for Hisi Chin-ping, the President of China.
However, the experts say that if Beijing is well tacticed, the US's commercial war pressure can be good for China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision, whether in Washington or in Beijing, could create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into an economic turbulence, is much more serious than the observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant for Asia as a researcher at New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, states the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that he is ready to return to volunteer refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed for more than seven years in the war.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the state of the country would improve.
"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there is every condition that refugees should return to the country, which had to escape between terrorism and economic measures, which affected their everyday lives and their lives.
According to the UN, Syrians left the country more than 5.5 million since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people living in this country need humanitarian help.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would like to take all the help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they did not accept conditional assistance or co-operation from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe has acquired the Ryder coupa in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Couple in 2018, defeating the US team in 16,5:10,5 proportions outside Le Gold National on Paris.
The US has now fallen six times on the European scene and has not won Ryder coup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14,5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson's American star player, who was struggling on the whole tower, put his hit in the water at the par-3 16 holes, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari glowed all around, so it became one of the four players who have ever achieved the 5-0-0 results since the tournament started in the current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth received 5+4 from the lowest player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2+1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in the last Ryder coup.
The eight Ryder-couple veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of the tournament for all time with 25,5 career points.
“I don’t cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy I'm so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to help you," he said after the European victory of Garcia, who is struggling with emotions.
The staftbot is handed over to Jon Rahm, who won the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on Sunday 2+1 individually.
“I feel incredibly proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man,” said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now he has a 13-213 career record in the Ryder cup.
It's a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 main titles and who only Jack Nicklaus does.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who have been great at the whole gym.
After the disappointing results of the U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, he stated that “he was proud of these boys because they fought.
There was an occasion this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Get the hat down in front of Thomas.
That's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, the American PGA, and our Ryder Couple Commission, to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your captain.
You're gonna have to raise your hats.
The opponent was better than us."
