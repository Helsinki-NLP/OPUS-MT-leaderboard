A 9-year-old boy on escape in Tampere found
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance declaration of a son from Western Tamperee with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and there is no danger of life and health.
The son's father told Ilta-Sanom that he was found at midnight.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start examining.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo as a hurricane again... Ripped the goal break to the Messiah.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued its factory in the Masters League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Championship of the Championship of the Champions' League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the painting statistics of all time when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of punishment and one game situation.
Ronaldo lifted his goal balance to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messique, which was read with him, has 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been compiled in the Italian football league in Serie A since early, but in the D-section of the Champions' League, it started in a strong 2-1 visitor win from Manchester City.
The winning painting made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juvenus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-driven Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured at the election game, only came to the field with the last ten minutes.
Another company in Manchester United also experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 deaths.
Luke Shaw's guest match of the 20-year-old law enforcement officer in ManU lasted only 15 hours.
The dangerous sliding stretch of PSV Moreno hit the goal towards the attacked ManU pack so bad that Shaw probably broke his leg bone.
Shaw slept on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff went to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but the joy of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened it before it took a break with an extra time.
The PSV winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
At the Masters' League, the painting season began the A block of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was an Argentinean Angel Di Maria, who changed the pants of Manchester United's shirt to the PSG stunt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball through the back corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
The PSG has been conjected with the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the lengths of the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Starfleet of the PSG, met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow CsSKA lost 0-1 at the B block match in Germany to Wolfsburg.
The opposition party immediately called for resignation, the president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech as he had held a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has kept the same speech in the country's Parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe 91 is in full spirit power.
The Prime Opposition Party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because it's too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's presidency and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want a special summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra EU leaders summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
Mr Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Merkel, fall within the table of the Ministers of Interior.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
The voice is just a little colored university teacher, Shannon Lamb, during the emergency call, tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb underlined that his "Dear Dog" is alive and probably shocked, as well as said that the contact details of the dead woman's closest relatives are found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written on the side of Amy Prentiss' body and hate: "I am so sorry that I could cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter, which, according to the experts, was signed by Lamb.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesota's Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled almost 500 miles to a school campus where the police believed that he had shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, told the university staff about the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while afterwards.
By the end of the day, the number of the dead rose: Lamb committed suicide when the cop was surrounded by a belly.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after the pupils and staff had to hide behind the locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but with potential problems.
Students told me they were waiting for her hours.
The police at the Prentiss Death County, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book in which he thanked the "powerful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught by a social science and history institution with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but he said he also seemed nervous and unrestly, "I don't think something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that she had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's remuneration policies meant that although Lamb had worked hard in advance of his doctorate, it did not give him any automatic career development and auxiliary professor's office.
Director William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in his mind.
The Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped from the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in Mississippi's Greenville suburbs, told Methel Johnson the death investigation investigator of the Washington County.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught science and educational knowledge. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said he was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston for many years to play guitar.
He was a pretty charming man that time.
All the girls were melting wax when she was there, told me now 40 years old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but their marriage has no evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house in the riverside in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together at some work.
O'Steen told me his daughter's doing and singing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the last night before September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lipstick show for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were playing games and throwing dicks to each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year student seminar program and was specialised in Indians and colonial history, reported at the school of English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and he had three little children.
He studied in Kansas Emporia at State University and was chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State Campus, Cleveland held a candle training, involving approximately 900 people, including education and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mess during which the university choir sang the songs of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississip's Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus Mississip's Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the police now saying that Lamb has called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb was referring to him as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for the holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the retailer of toys and babies says that the current regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to make more hours.
According to the company, it intends to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while during the 2014 holiday period the number of employees was 45 000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews of the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the purchase season of Christmas time is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help them in the occupation of shops, and in the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking with Princess Diana.
The first night of the movie was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said the documentary film coming in back in Time's trailer.
The movie begins and I think that I'm just a squeeze and a hand pull away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the return to the future film, to which Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd were interviewed, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and director of production Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it's definitely the finest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some movie theater in October.
The UN leader says that Syria's situation is not solved armedly.
The reply of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Russia adds military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is "not solved armedly", and the extra weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
Again, the UN leader called on all parties, including a divided UN Security Council, to join and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
In a Wednesday press conference, Ban told me that he was going to meet the ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - in connection with the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces " has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and unanimity in dealing with the Syrian crisis when they were conciliated with the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 advocates which show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to stamp him into a windmill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for a crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to squeeze Donald Trump off the top of the support surveys, it has not been successful.
The last 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump have been in charge in the two-digit century, and some have started to consider seriously what this means for the title of the real estate king.
Of course, the election season is only in the early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump would probably become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leadership to Herman Cain, one of which did not back any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
The external groups, such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation for Club for Growth, have, however, noted Trump's stiffness and have started to use its resources to put him down.
The following recent statements of support indicate that the real estate king is not just a transitional phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University's support surveys showed that only two of the ten republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says that they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In Iowa, the University of Quinn Market, last week, 60% of the Republicans said that they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of the Republicans said they would be either "inspired" or "happy" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "dead" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves mostly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent "inspired" vs. Trumpin 40 per cent).
Next is the most enthusiastic thing?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfactory" or "abundant" if the popular Jeb Bush of the authorities became candidate.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post report, 52% of the republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
The survey of the Quinn market last week indicates that in the state of Iowa, the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of the Republicans think that Trump has the right character for the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44% thinks, however, that his character is not suitable for the president, and almost six out of ten believes that his nature is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trum the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be appointed as a candidate for the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball.
During the last parliamentary period at this time, four of the ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry was appointed a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, since the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey carried out at Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bushia with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's at the level with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were to be set up against them, Ben Carson would win a businessman from Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Right and just most of the Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure to say that it would never change its mind.
46% said that they might be able to switch candidates.
Anyway, Trump's biggest competitor at present is another unlikely winner, neurokirurg Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "raisers" in his campaign talk, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's ability to drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebuilding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six of the ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, it is also Donald Trump.
The impoverishment of the government has risen to a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, due to a large part of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person than someone with government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
The two-week survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg from Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "real angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first presentation at the Prime Minister's Question class
Corbyn's first presentation at the Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his choice.
The new leader of the Labour Force Party, Jeremy Corby, meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby is rising up to ask about its first six questions a little after midday, and it is likely that both the media and the representatives of the Labour Party will be closely watching his performance.
Corbyn has demanded this weekly show to be "lower theater and more facts."
He also said that he could leave some of the occasions for his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre for Trade Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the head of the Labour Party to stand quietly during the national song in the Tuesday Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the World War of Britain, has raised criticism with the Conservative Party’s representatives and has appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said his "respectfully quietly" and that he acknowledges "the bravery of the royal air forces in the Great Britain Air War."
Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight, that he would have called the head of the Labour Party to sing the national song despite the fact that he thinks the King's House should be shut down.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's internal context, insisting on disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
BBC Political correspondent Robin Brant says that the costumes on the part of the party's position in the European Union and the government's ceiling have also been "developed" within the working party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Centre for Trade Associations that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Secretary for Work and Retirement Smith of the shadow government stated that the party was "very clear" in relation to the fact that they only oppose government plans to lower the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 230,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has encountered in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The head of the Labour Party has pledged a new approach to policy and is now telling us that he has "bundled" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Congressman Corbyn of the Islington North region has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Times is too contradictory and that he intends to abstain from both clever wording and stunning, but instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequalities and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's economic secretary, Angela Eagle, will be replaced by her inquiry classes when Corby is not involved, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should at times be given the floor, and he has said that he has approached the President of the sub-room, Mr Bercowi, from the point of view.
When Cameron came to the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often combined with the Prime Minister's questionnaires, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since they were started on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important meter in assessing the director's discretion, the management of his subroom, and his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticised questions about the fact that they have become only clumsy, which requires far-reaching reforms.
described in Joburg: Non-home young people are trained as photographers
It's a difficult place in Johannesburg to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and earn living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and gain profits from it.
The BBC News met one of the first young people who completed the project.

The value of the GBP increases as the UK wage rises
The value of the GBP jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in the UK wage increase, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, with the exception of bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth target was fastest after 2009 and it was considered to be accompanied by an estimate of the increase in courses.
Pounds rose over $1,555, and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct shares on the market and increased by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The contract would combine two of the world's biggest brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after a competing luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
The latest sales figures in Richemont were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 per cent after the mining giant told me that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating shares as part of its debt management strategy.
The shares of the packing and paper group Mondi were the highest players in the index by 4.3% after the Goldman Sachs changed their recommendation from the company to the "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company published information about its profits for six months before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to JD Sports director, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wages for workers are raised in the UK, it may mean "the purchasing power of potential consumers will grow".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be focused on the company's enlargement plans, and he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash starts a grass-rooted campaign against entry into Ald's sector
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA store from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash's wholesaler has launched a grass root campaign to defend the share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before the $700 million attack on Aldi.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the opening of the first trade next year to South and West Australia, with up to 120 trades coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local distributors and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events, such as Adelaide show.
IGA's dealers and buyers have jumped along, and brands such as Dunsborough's ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offers tastes in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to their Australian football games to their stock customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesale dealer of food, alcohol and iron goods is organising an annual strategy day for investors.
There is a lot in the game, as the South and West Australia represents almost 30% of the IGA business area of Metcash, and the profit margins are higher than the IGA network of East Metcash.
At shopping in South and West Australia, visitors are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the eastern countries.
However, analysts, like Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In his weekly report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually and Metcash can lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up next year in the south of 25 and in the west 30 movements, which will generate $500 and $600 million turnover in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million of profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, with a market share of 14 per cent of 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at the business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "may be lost in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the IGA market share has decreased from 18 % to 14 %, and Metcash’s income on food and food business that transmits products to around 1200 IGA resellers has decreased by 43 % since 2012.
The wholesale seller, however, holds its side, and has invested more than EUR 150 million per year by calculating the prices of hundreds of products per week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair stores by increasing faster fresh food and bringing on a better range of private labels.
Ian Morrice, Director-General of Metcash, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of shops have increased attraction and hopes that the wholesale seller will return to the way of growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Union, supports Thanas Kokkinakis
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been suffering side by side in a recent storm that has been swept around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says the Australian Tennisional Union president Steve Healy.
Cokkinakis, the younger member of the talented twin named "Special Ks", was unwilling to be released in a case where Cyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after this, in the fire fight in Cincinnat, the judge had to separate the Cocktail and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Even though the last time the chef was seen scattering his land after the cramp ruined his possible victory on Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a firm defender of the cook.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth from another place in double games with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semi-final against Britain.
"I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the rubbish," Healy said.
He broke his mile when he lost the cramp in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mile when he frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has acted very well, also in quite provoking situations with the US Open Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a fine team around him, he has a fine family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature when he is 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he exercises firmly, is in good condition and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take into account the important games that started on Friday, and I describe this "common decision" as a good solution to all, but I still support the Canberrai return to the team's vacation.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games, and not all the poles around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public in reflecting these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency situation, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared an exceptional state and closed its southern borders, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of blocking the flow of immigrants coming into the country.
On the border there was chaos following hundreds of migrants gathering into a neutral area, and Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who fled violence from their home countries have now set up their tents and settled for an indefinite period between the two country inspection stations.
However, despair grew.
As the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and yelling to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that it is impossible to accept the return of migrants from Hungary when they are coming from more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the border between Hungary and Serbia occurred after the 28 nationality group failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and the Ministers were hoping to reach a final agreement - either next month or at the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday next week, the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will call for an extra EU summit to discuss the continental immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases can be accelerated.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the aid on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up its borders against Romania in order to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
Charlie D'Agata, correspondent in CBS News, reported that even prisoners were recruited to complete the staple bar between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the point of arrival in the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life and that those who are fleeing from the war are entitled to protection - this view is strongly inconsistent with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight now define a criminal offence by the company to cross or damage 4 metres (13 feet) of stainless wire cord, which the government has built on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
The Hungarian Government declares the emergency situation because of the situation caused by mass migration, and the Government reporter Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear in this regard: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the military position expected for next week, but the suppliers of the Associated Press on the border have seen for days a heavyly armed military staff with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempts to cross the border, and that they had already reached 15 countries.
They got past by harming the fence, now being imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of the violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also shut down two of the seven crossing points from the borders of Serbia after sending a trailer covered with a wire to shut down one of these places.
The main crossing point near the Hungarian Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office for the processing of metal containers and the crowds invaded in.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands of them got out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main engineway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National Question Survey Hillary Clinton Head of Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit regime in the Democratic Democratic Championship, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be stalking him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the democratic voters (of 58%) and the second Sanders supports 27% (of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to join the presidential competition, but he is in favour of 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-elections, the majority of the democratic voters observe that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters are more firmly behind their own choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined with a number of population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and Sanders has risen somewhat at the same time.
Clinton is strongly in charge with women and moderates, but his leadership is narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's front trip to democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and now he's even with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders runs this group with five percentage points.
Approximately half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a candidate of the party.
The fourth says that he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely to be very enthusiastic in supporting him.
Thoughts are more confused with those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, only a quarter would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of the democratic voters say they would eagerly support Clinton, Donald Trump, the first of the Republicans, says the lesser Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked on an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had an appropriate experience (16%), and the most popular answers were that it is now the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President has an impact on the potential candidate for the President, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him already in the race, even though a third disagrees.
When asking the Democrat voters who they would choose for the second party's appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Over half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the candidates of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden's source is involved, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voteable has grown.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what is most important in the candidate, they put their opinions ahead of voting.
Also, last month, no democratic candidates or potential candidates were considered impossible for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's doing three best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters say that Clinton is not considered to be honest and reliable, which is twice more than Sanders (15%), but 27% says that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these points, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server as a foreign minister still raises questions, the majority of the democratic voters are pleased with his explanation and says that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided shortly after the daylight.
The majority of the Americans say that the e-mails did not affect their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinions of him have deteriorated.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has calculated 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not considered to be honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of all the registered voters in the country do not consider Trum to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered well leaders.
Six candidates involved in the study are considered to be the most honest candidates of Bidenia, Carson and Bush.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many do not have his opinion, just as Carson does not.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of the votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the foot.
Throughout the Republican voters, Trum is still strongly in favour of a CBS survey of 23% from 27% of the questionnaire published on Tuesday before the Fox News debate last month.
But at the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson was well coped with different demographic groups and is outraged among the highly educated Republican voters in Trump.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichi of Ohio. The support of Governor Wisconsin, Scott Walker, has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, are at levels at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 republican voters in the latest survey in September is +/-6 per cent.
Last week's survey of CNN/ORC showed Carson's rise in surveys: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is above him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
When Carson's favor rises last week, Trump criticizes the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said his campaign visit to Iowa last Saturday.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a student in the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died in the Brotherhood's Simputusseremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, the murder accusation has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi University of Baruch College in New York City cruelly attacked Chu 'Michael' Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his taking to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag of more than 13 kilos of sand, and then he was repeatedly stabbed to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood didn't call 911 after Deng fainted, but the charges said they were waiting an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look for information on the network about his symptoms, and contact the national president of the brotherhood Andy Mengi, asking for advice, the police chief Chris Wagner told me at the press conference.
"That is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the brotherhood’s well-being ahead of Michael Deng," said Wagner, police chief.
He didn't wake up, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated dull object attacks on the head, body and thighs.
"There have been too many families who have been suffering from the brotherhood’s apprenticeship when at least one student has died annually since 1970," Doug Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, stated in his opinion.
Brotherhoods and their members must be responsible, and this step by the authorities is important.
The grand jury in Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the third-grade murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent smuggling and criminal plots.
"We do not want to be responsible only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what has happened that has either officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held responsible," Wagner said at a Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned his connection to the local department by the brotherhood and the national fraternity.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The interest rate increase is coming, and the market in the rising rates falls, the income of bonds is rising and the economy will have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past does not much help with the timing that comes specifically to the economy.
The return has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first lift, sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in the increase of interest rates has often been, although not always, a factor in how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly the trend of time to normalise the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
At the end, however, market participants may find that all the interest rate-related mortgages have been over-minded.
"The first increase in the central bank's post-global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as a result of the end of the period of "bad money"," said the main economic expert in Capital Economics, Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal, although still low, to the level of a devastating shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
Underneath the review of how some of the economic sectors will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last about a month, waiting for an increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not that dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's increase.
In particular, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days afterwards the situation is fairly even (mean increase of 2.6%) and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the leading capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management in the recent analysis of Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when the return begins to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be nearest its lowest level in all times before the central bank's interest rate is increased.
According to Deutsche Bank, a nominal annual GDP increase of 118 after 1950 has only been less than 4.5 % twice.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, it is rare to believe that it will remain once the third quarter has evolved by 1.5 per cent, the Federal Reservation Bank of Atlanta reports.
The increase in interest in such a fragile economic regulation can be risky and raise the question of "whether this time is different", Deutsche Bank stated.
The parties have been reserved for an increase in the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for a meeting of this week's Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategics and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade expects only 25% of the probability.
"Our research shows that from 1950 onwards all the increase cycles have so far experienced an increased leverage effect in supercycles where GDP has passed its predecessor peak very quickly after recovery has begun," reports the report.
On the other hand, an exceptionally slow recovery has been underway, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting for the most far out of the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months.
The fixed return has also been instability in the market when the interest rate is expected, and the model is somewhat resembled the findings of the capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are reflected more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The trend of debt securities yields seems to change immediately for the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on debt securities will be reduced immediately," said Deutche Bank.
The Charles Schwab strategy believes that the increase in interest will lead to a convergence in the profits of longer and shorter-term bonds, thereby reducing the return rates.
High-income bonds are often better generated in this situation, although "we are still cautious about the search for profits", Schwab's fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones said in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the CB's orientation expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the markets have adapted to a stronger monetary policy perspective," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is evener, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characterised by the market when the central bank has tightened its direction.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing worse when the dollar increase makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"The archaeologist shows that the 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the first three months after the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts said their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover passed the low turnover after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares made better than low-quality companies, with a first average of 4 (percentage) and the latter 3 (percentage).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in dollar value.
Savings can also benefit from higher profits, even though experts disagree with how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says Congressman Andrew Bingham.
Conservative secretary Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "conspiracy"
He claims that disqualifying it from a commercial competitor will become more and more difficult
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards target, saying that they were just imitating British Awards awards.
Congressman Damien Collins criticizes the Voice, saying that it's not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims the leading representative of the additional production company's pressure to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative Commissioner Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on the content of the "communicating" and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "the public sense" to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Prize Gate, which was charged last December.
"The last year's BBC Music Awards only seem to be a British Awards gala under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different here, there are two examples that I remember directly when you were actually just copying something that we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC contested the charges claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much above its commercial competitor as regards live music and the sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Previously on this year, head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classic music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC supply criticised for the entry of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, the Conservative Tory Party, criticizes the Voice, the music contest that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often debated because it is not original and is not quite unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this programme of the BBC1 channel, where the star judges are Paloma Faith and Boy George, is produced in the real BBC style.
He added that he would like the production company to find success inside his own house the next time it started the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of the forthcoming periods of the Voice, or to order the money of the authorising paying agents to be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose to date at least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the increase was low after the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may control consumption
For over a decade, virtual purchases have grown dramatically and have transformed many of the British shopping skats into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs of a levelling net sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only 7% rise to the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew at least then in 2000: only 5 per cent from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling of net sales in the air when the latest figures showed only 7% rise to the first quarter of 2015.
"If we were looking at the growth levels of the previous years and returning to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalised over time", Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index supplier, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people bought online and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it eases, and (growing) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been held as one of the reasons behind slowing shops.
Experts believe that consumers will control the purchase before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the normal average was five times more buyers wandered to their computers to grab shops, pouring down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made buyers argue about findings, can control the purchases.
In a study published by the British Retail Consortium, it was found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using shoppers’ fashion chains.
Muslims bury Meka in a lifting accident, the consequences of Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Meca
Saudi Arabia has partially accused the collapse of building giant Saudi Binlad Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that there were also 394 injuries when the lifted cucumber collapsed
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them; and the victims died when the lifted cucumber collapsed in the great mosque of Mecha.
In general, the white-dressed mourners filled the route to respect the first of the dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad journey passed by a holy place where only a few days ago the lifted cucumber fell through the mosque roof and fell over the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the building group of the Bin Laden family was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the 29 bodies of the worshipers killed by the raided raiders in the great mosque of Meka were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton from Manchester, and he was on his first pilgrimage when the lifted cucumber collapsed.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the beginning of the year-on-year period of Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already sworn that the Hajj Mekka will continue when thousands of people keep coming to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binlad Group should not have left the lift up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version said that the Binlad Group is partly the reason for the collapse.
The English service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s managers were banned from travelling abroad.
Previously on this week, Salman sworn to find out what caused the fall of lifts into the yard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the later in this month.
The Binlad Group has not published reports on the collapse of the misery, and its representatives have not been captured for commentary purposes.
The royal decision also accused the association of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifting cucumbers around the big mosque of Meka, which are part of the huge building attack led by the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arab ruler family for decades and leads to major construction projects.
Al-Qaida's deceased leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son forbidden by the family in the 1990s.
The wreckage took place in wind and rain weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the sanctuary, which each of the capable Muslims must do at least once in their lives.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
A million rials (174 000 GBP) were assigned by the authorities to the families of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that low-cost workers in Eastern Europeans are behind the popularity
The British are using more and more aid services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, city principal correspondent to Daily Mail
It is said that the British will give up their hammers and paints and rather hire skilled Eastern European workers to make home rehabilitation
Looks like if you're clever with a hammer or beat the walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to do tea-self-works in their homes, reports the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at the prank price.
This will result in Kingfisher's planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she would like more women to work at B&Q stores because the purchase decisions made in eight ten are specifically made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single women's economies, where there are more homework than before.
Laury said, "The majority of our stores' staff still have men.
We need to find a better balance.
Nonetheless, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process."
Laury is only one of the five women leading to the main companies of the UK FTSE100 index, which has rebuilt its management team with equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with equally 50 % of women, including its Director and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference here is an important thing.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher announced the bill in both production and sale for six months after the group took the costs of closing down the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owning Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new movements
The government of the three Aces decided to rely on forced legislation to save the country's economy.
Even though the effects were very rapid, they were very rapidly affected.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other employees' centre organisations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the broad expression of workers.
A little bit of a lot of people think that's a reason.
Let's see if it's worth breaking when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been on the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, they are going to work.
In old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declaring a wealthy would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people in millions of trade organizations does not take much moments, but it gives us the reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union is no longer so obvious as 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the objectives of the movement, the values have changed
From an interesting point of view of the activity of Ay, the government's brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
As things have appeared to be rolling over the years with their own weight, the unions are finally able to reach the issue, namely the rights of the worker to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary.
Let's do whatever it takes to do with the organizations, so it's silly that the phenomenon of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has already decreased for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's heads.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranna: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduced staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranna starts with the aim of savings, with a total of 8.5 million euros to reduce costs.
As a part of savings, the university will start joint consultations on the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this is about 130 reductions.
Other activities are also intended to save two million.
The Single Negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which is expected to have a deficit of 8.5 million.
This will also be influenced by the government's appropriations operations.
In this financial year, the university will produce about 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly for the next year, but the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The overall budget of the University is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The co-efficient of the reduction of major education and research operations and corporate funding to our university is extremely important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's newsletter.
Before summer, the effects of surgery seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new scales.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last the six weeks laid down by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail transport is expected to be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is the subsidy of the capital region in 2017-2018.
Long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus's plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport from other international companies, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The US Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow from the side when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
As Reuters made a survey to 80 economic scientists, little more than half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero level and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars in balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to raise, but the signs show that they also believe that the probability is against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology message.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting his colleagues later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "forgivable" for the first murder and hoped, "this could be canceled", the authorities said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier's police told me that the teacher of geography and social science at Delta University, Lamb called an emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police need to send officers to his home.
He said, "He killed his wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "solid dog" in the house that doesn't bother anyone, but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was a body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove almost 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed his historian teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killed himself late on Monday when he was surrounded by a police officer.
Director William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in his mind.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the arguments published on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "guarantee information or evidence" of any "tripleodrama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple of them broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "retired."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughters were "one of the best friends of all time."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand online from his home. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that he's not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb Road 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta Statesta in the spring of 2015, reports the credentials available on the University's website.
Stars that lost their charming power
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been difficult in recent years.
In 2001 he was sick of leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possessions.
All of these really require their taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw got a double fracture on his right foot when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven at the Championship.
Even if the defendant was stuck in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play this season.
The injury caused the Hector Moreno's unreasonable strike 15 minutes after Shaw, 20 years old, had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field, and he had to be aired before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing at the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got the red card and the punishment bag.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian editor was wrong.
You can judge the situation when I say it was a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tactic.
Shaw twiittad as follows: "Thanks for all your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Concerning the issue: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June European championship competitions in France.
Coach of PSV Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone's very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland in the 2014 MM races.
"Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's stabbing.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this could be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not last long until it is almost learning out.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service offered the childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favourite children’s book, he chose a story of the environmental protection of Dr. Seussin The Lorax, published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book's story, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new figures and details were added to fill in a rather short original text.
"In the city of Needlle, inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams with the heart of the girl by filling Audrey's wish to see the right tree", the text says and describes the love story Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it had been taken from the Lorax film description found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins with the following: "In the city of Needle in the Walls, where everything is artificial and even air is commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams with Audrey's heart."
Given the fact that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexperienced by the book's plot, a young, anonymous son will hear how local nature has destroyed the greedy, tree-blowing and accessories of Kerskane, without passing on to the story of a short, fierce creature named Lorax, who "abouts for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR mission is probably outlined for an assistant who apparently has never read a book for a child 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's reporter said the text must have come from the Cameron Electoral Office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think the recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut down a evacuation.
Alastair Cook's side may have less experience than a team three years ago, but it has good spinners and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in its spinning and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related to this: Adam Lyth fell from the British Cricket Team, his replacement will be Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging circumstances, and the simple but hard truth is that cricket players are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press, because, as I have said before, players are the best choices.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The chief coach in England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me.
It's hard to answer the question how long the hitter gets to leave.
Lyth was elected seven times to the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and visitors.
The only subject of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to Caribbean when Lyth was in great shape, but the lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with you, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of something we saw in Yorkshire early this time when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen's beating is sphered next to Cook, where an extra feeder could be held, but I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the hitter could not be hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is a third to them, and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when he fell to the first sleeve before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a thief, and the little thing I've been dealing with with him seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his incredible statistics - hitting the average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gambling, but there's not too many feeders and the electorates chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough increases on the coach side.
The appointment of the Srilanka hitter Mchain Jayawardene as a consultant for games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in with the white ball games and brings with it both energy and unsatisfactory stunning.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, it was then playing or training, and he has the same horror to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and choices do not make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
British departure from the EU (Brexit) can take profits if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-final renegotiating strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic every day, even if it does not even take into account the hearty Jeremy 'Is it yes or not'? Corbyn's choice of the management of the working party or of the madness of the centre of trade unions in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
The European Diplomatic Brother recently explained that, since the EU is so deep in various crises, of which not all have its own cause, some Member States are tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, which is full of disagreements and disrupting changes in the treaty that these countries do not mostly want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Associations decided that neither would it want them if they were to rape social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfieagenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local memorandum, either with or without the local eyebrow, and then coming home to say that they will win supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out inside the British EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with France", says from Berlin - suggests that the shortest ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they do not care if we leave.
The German cautious and moderate alliance Chancellor Angela Merkel is a federal man, but he has been in power for 10 years and he wants to leave his actions before it goes to ruin the same way as thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's the power to get out of here too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, a left-handed government in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves for the selfiebrits when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even plan to make consciously useless comments to the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 referendum campaign in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations had a case" and "Renegotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had a terrible experience of how the greedy Fleet Street newspaper is capable of being and how the EU-Skeptic exclusive authorities of the press were not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio of 2:1.
They can bluntly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist, who made the name of himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as a correspondent in Brussels in the early '90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a booklet of tax-raising strangers, mobile hacking foreigners, and persons whose place of residence is nominated elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same way about them, but he realized that if you were in a cage with a passionate gorilla, bananas must be surrendered because of the confusion, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more than Blair himself, as far as Cameron was opposed to the renegotiation tragedy, which was accepted by the Bair under the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgived him.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I said to him that he had no more time to waste time on me) seems to be in danger of reintroduction of Neil Kinnock's 80s' boikotation of Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he must develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but without doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC suite Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the United Kingdom's Independence Party of Ukip's military initiative and the arrogant nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly be behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-Fan" Benn said this in both radio and TV this week, when his internal patrol would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the Karski John McDonnell shadow government as the Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father squeezed on TV trying to be unloyal to the government colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far to lose his dominant position.
Hilary's pinnings were more attractive.
But in favour of the fight to remain "wherever it is" - benn's slamming - was not what McDonnell said, and in the light of everything that Corby told the main gates and the referendums at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhierarchy, sensual and personal image Corbyn wants to pass on (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communications is important during the period of the 24-hour TV, and especially in social media circumstances that are acceptable to growth for paranoids and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing the Labour Party to support the referendum campaign itself.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's basic rounds on membership of the EU (and therefore, in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and their anti-capitalistic past) are no longer merely difficult to discuss with those on the left hand with whom the narcissism of minor differences is a key dogm in the study.
As far as he is concerned with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not have a campaign to give up) foreign diplomas must only try to explain it to his superiors.
Why should either Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) in favour of the UK, when it can be completely in vain?
The United States has already disappointed the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the power of a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded on Monday at the start of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the Public Health England electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency's claim that electricity locomotives are 95% less harmful than traditional, started with a meeting of 12 people in which some had connections to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts aligned with the evidence used by Lancet in the Public Health England (PHE) report on electricity tobacco.
The PHE published this "virstant column" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Publication of Medical Times Lancet published last month an editorial that attacked the PHE's main lead decision against the "normal hutera bottom".
Two other researchers in BMJ have considered whether the arguments were "built on rock or sand."
The European Public Health Professor Martin McKee at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, say: "The main principle of national health is that action must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's argument "the best estimate is that electricity pounds are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on the detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people developing a multi-critical decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with various products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of the BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One meeting of 12 people announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding that he was reported to have received earlier from Philip Morris International, they will increase.
The selection criteria of the panel members are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also say that they have received funding in the field of research.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise under the supervision of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the director of PHE's tobacco.
The study produced by the group "soundingly admits" that there is a lack of "undeniable evidence on harm in most products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say the PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that the electric tobacco works as a route to burn children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE's health and well-being, says that the arguments raised in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "The airbags are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lives will die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electricity tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term impacts.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance in relation to the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die annually from smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS GBP 2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - even though the electricity locomotives aren't riskless - they are just a fraction of the damages of traditional tobacco, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says the former Channel 4 Director.
Former President-in-Office of Channel 4 Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "written anything" of the hits such as this soap series on the Albert Square street.
Johnson said that the licensing fees should only be used to make programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticises BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to be smaller than the public, in a difficult time of broadcasting, against the most popular programmes of competitors and channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he came to Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that would be clearly agreed on non-discriminatory competitors," Johnson said to the communication committee of the upper room as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the fee is to be held - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and do.
The Voicea will be sent to the most important time of mission because it will be desired to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, that's ridiculous, that's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders second, no doubt carried out within the house.
In fact, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's a public service delivery.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010, led by the series entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is committed to hunting the number of audiences "for the objectives of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the most popular series of BBC, which reminds us of Tony Ball's comments from the former Sky Director. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of the BBC's smaller public service are "going to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but BBC therefore meets its area of responsibility and then, when defending 4 billion GBP licences, it is hypocritical to say that "We do, I suppose, we are doing all of these unknown programmes that no one sees".
They're gonna put them on a mission site where no one's ever going to look at them.
With regard to the fee, Johnson said to the Committee, "I will ask you to find a more regressive system in who will receive the most of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for people with 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
Former Head of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its timely role in "information, training and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as training - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take models from Australia's and Canada's broadcasters and change the form of "information, enlightenment and entertainment".
As far as the partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on the events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only some people on television, and to join commercial companies so that they can be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change their direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them with sound wavelengths.
Little shuttles change their direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to hear the human ears.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the performance of a new method called sound genetics, which allows the use of ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a Salk Institute researcher in California, told The Guardian that one day, the method can replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive measure leading to the brains of humans to treat the Parkinson’s disease.
Sugar beads usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed ultrasound waves that then pass through worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP-4-ionic ports, structures in some worm cell films.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, reported in the report published in the Natural Communications magazine.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled shuttle mats, Chalasani genetically edited worms so that parts of their motion nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified mats, the microscopes confirmed waves and transmitted them to mats where they switch on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a career-developing tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent from the optical fiber to the desired position within the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue inevitably, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using genetic therapy and therapeutic virus, the targeted human nerve cells may be able to instantly respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertisements may be ashamed of the British arms trade
Look at the video against Amnesty International arms fairs.
Terrible killers!
The leg irons crushing your ankles!
Grape bombs!
And electronic stunning lamps that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
There is no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parade produced by Amnesty International in order to emphasise the British Government's desire to trade weapons for oppression governments at the Excel Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International at the London docks.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared in bus stops and metro trains that require more accurate access.
"Requisite information, will you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18?" together you will be asked using the underground font and brand of London, when the DLR track changes into the picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route, and customers are asked to help stop gun fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Plans of Public Plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is six pounds of packing six block keys, which according to the collective, "is accessing a third of the whole planet's bus stop advertising mode".
Transport for London is not amusing about this unauthorised "publiary dentalism".
One of the parodiamainos produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex journal Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
The second anti-arm poster is greeting workers in the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook over 100 000 times during the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background reporter worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, found that the arms fairs were not advertised at all - and also in the ExCeL calendar there was an empty spot - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They used to play with the idea of a more realistic, blurred corporation advertising, but "it was more obstructive to stress it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the arms fairs comes from inside of ExCeL when the samplers sell fantastic decorated products.
He was released in his press release that he received a order from the U.S. Army from the AT4CS RS triggered from the left.
This includes a "first-quality plumbing drill which has excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight gold rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student's apartment when I was unaware, and then I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the people I've irritated, the smiling smiles and many, long complaints of others.
A large part of what I learned can be summarised into eight simple rules.
Moving into the apartment can be anything from nerves to totally scary.
It's fascinating to talk about: tell me where you are from, have you held the interim year and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just an yeast of the HahaHAhahaha to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire, and they'll share shutters.
Give people room.
Human rooms are often converted into cocktail invitations, cinema stores and high places of entertainment, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even imagine starting a university when you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many of the apartments form a culture of travel, which is friendly, social and that causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say, "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but now you have to leave, so I can get back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student's tired of socializing, and maybe send a message to the door instead of knocking.
To knock when it came up, knock.
One guy in my student apartment felt that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw some pretty stuff.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start at the university in the top season, knocking people's doors with a chocolate bakery plate and showing yourself seems to be a little less strange, less "fare to the neighborhood, baking something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50.
Offering self-decorated delicious deliciouss is a great way to be friends.
Your fellow residents feel obligated to talk, and it may be that they will continue to link your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, it depends on if you know how to bake.
Badly blended flour-sugar fat vacuums are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in students' apartments.
I understand that taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Why don't you ask the owner of the milk and check it out?
It's possible they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more grown up than my apartmentmate that mixed his milk into the washing matter to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to be noisy so that people don't get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like the pot of the proverb ringing the roof.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play a drum and bass music slowly because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music shaking, locking their doors and going to a three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved to the same apartment with you?
Or in turn, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you view a cottage partner as your future spouse, beat yourself together, resign, and then see him every day, and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if a hot cottage partner isn't really your future spouse, you could even try to make sense to your bottom.
In that delightful moment when you find that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between the fight and the temptation is thinner than it seems.
Good trick is fun, but it can be canceled in a moment.
You can give us a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something, but never mess with someone's room with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
Lock up their doors and drop the keys in the water glass, then you put on the freezer, but don't stick their property on the roof with a blue tire than twice.
A racist attack on foreign students' home in Kite - The house that was planned for the reception centre was struck in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kitea in Northern Karelia was carried out at the home of foreign students.
Unlike the police earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers but the sleeping facilities of foreign students already in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Evangelical Academy of Kite.
The windows and walls of the facilities of the National Convention were tampered with racist marks, such as scatters, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation space, says the Itä-Suomen police.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher of the social guarantee training of young people at the University of Nations, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," says Luke.
The university has been hosting people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All the people in this messed up building have a status.
Some of them study in adult basic school, some are in professional studies and some learn Finnish," says Luukas.
The status A is the so-called continuous residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreigner who has already been in Finland.
The Itä-Suomen police are investigating the attack as a result of damage and breaking home peace.
According to Luke, the event was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had so many decades of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens", says Luukas.
According to Luke, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been moving on a light passenger car.
I think that this is the end of the youth weekend night when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," says Luke.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about this on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital's wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
It's been filed to the police for criminal records.
Adjustment 15.9 at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y train to Karjao, passengers in their heels, "good idiots"
The Y train passing from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjara stops passing in March.
The news disgusted the passengers on the main railway station in Helsinki who rose at the early night of the train.
In particular, the downstream is hit by the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's very idiotic, because the population increases all the time, and workers need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This cannot be attached to anything but political will or its lack.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video, he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
Train changes are also happening elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined to a new R line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry of Finance will buy the train during the following contract period.
The contract period is changing in the course of the year and the routes to be dissolved are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siunthian, believes that the state's train cutting is a short-looking activity.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then you'll be repentant.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and civilians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Espoo’s Annina Powder was harmed by the train from the urban area to the destiny of the travelers.
"It is utterly miserable for those who have to reschedule their journey," he said when he pained his Y train.
There's a little relief on the line.
There must be a new train connection coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the area of the Helsinki Region’s transport (HSL), i.e. take it to the Church Numme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year for the Y train, of course, much more.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions.
Instead, the number of train shifts is doubled in Ainola and Sauna Kalio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes in the whole country will cease.
The Ministry no longer buys train transport from the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The train shifts are reduced on routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made per year on the day of the day when there are about nine million trips in the transport purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State's annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
The Sixth Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeline book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The global crisis has raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final edition of Capital in 1867-1894, writes the timeline of Marx's capital in the book today published by Mr Hakane as former President of GDP.
"He's being taken more seriously than for a long time now," writes Hakanen in his premonition.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and intrusion in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly far-reaching.
Aalto University professor, a valued economic operator, Sixten Korkman, can also be found on the list of writers of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is the timely "you and forever".
But the former CEO of Business Research and Business Delegation is not Marx, is it?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today social sciences are isolated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, an economic scientist, a journalist, a political agitator and a literary lesson.
"The common idea is that the history of the past tells the wrong opinions of dead men," begins Korkman.
The truth is, Marx's predictions have gone very bad.
Even though Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of the capitalism, Korkma wonders.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical positioning.
"The more important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We will now again discuss the points of interest of Marx, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical inflation," Korkma analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, it's worth working with Marx in Korkman's mind.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maoans and trots and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today the debate is more diversified, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political load of back years.
"Every societal scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like the other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals to be judged in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war of Sri Lanka, says the AFP News Office.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Tamilites.
In the civil war of Sri Lanka, it is estimated that at least 100 000 people died.
There's no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last few months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, and the UN report is required.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces Report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims of men as women.
According to the report, rebels have been committed to forced by sidelines and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not allow the establishment of a United Nations Court because foreign judges.
In England's yo test, it was possible to weigh social media.
In the autumn academic writings, Wednesday was on the turn of a long foreign language, the majority of which had English.
His skills in England were tested by over 16,000 experiments.
The test could have written a substance about social media.
Based on their own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the word 150-250 in English could show the administrator of the website’s advisor.
The title was the Aunt Dear Agony.
Aunt Agony is in charge of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
She had to ask her questions about how parents could also look at things for young people.
In total, there were four topics of the substance that had to be selected one.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses the third topic in Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school teacher Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a sitt from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was really nice.
It had to write a fire speech why companies should hire young people to work.
"One at least in our school, we've been trained to write speeches," says Lybeck and assesses the whole test as normal."
In the English experiment in Finnish - or Swedish - it was possible to answer questions about the texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of the summer chamber to climate change and the processing of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some Russian students (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when it comes to a test of another domestic, Swedish or Finnish.
In the upper secondary schools, the test will be arranged normally, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The student degree board invites the experts to find appropriate contacts in time to get to the trial.
Even more time may be granted if you can demonstrate that the delay was not due to your own carelessness.
In Oulu, they robbed a trade with guns and threats.
The store was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering squad wardrobe.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators to Helsinki - support batches from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against government operating decisions will block the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicts the police.
In advance, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Open and the STTK Alliance shall meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
It is also believed that the police are involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads to the rail road are closed from motor vehicles for a period of about 9.30-14.
Only alarm vehicles are released in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from the Caisaniem traffic circle, from the west direction of Mannerheimi.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it looks like that's enough.
I'm not taking a position on police work fighting.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming to support patrols from elsewhere in Finland due to the demonstration of mentality.
They don't tell us exactly what the police are doing.
"Something is coming, but, in general, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police call for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic stunt extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standby traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With demonstrators from other countries from Finland, Helsinki is also coming with a lot of orderbusses.
They're not allowed at the Railway.
The buses are going to be far away.
Then the rest of the journey must walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side.
The flooding issue of mass transport, which is normally handed over in these large crowds, will now be dealt with in part.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of government counterparts in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to be smooth.
People are ordinary working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," says Kujala.
On Friday, local expressions of mind are also organised across Finland.
On Friday, the expression of mind is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The big expression organized by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä emeritus Martti Siisiainen.
It's not a miracle that the Ay movement protests.
If it weren't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Coolie says.
The very rightful government has hit the core points of the Finnish Corporatism tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard choices are missing in contract law.
There are many traits here that ay-moving is really trying to get on its knees.
Also, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have all the employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep distribution that the demonstration of the mind will result in amongst those which the ay-liike would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from each side of Finland showed their views at the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If you were looking for a reference point for a Friday demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Shijainen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorsta gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho (Central) government struck from the labour market crisis to the point of view.
It was said that between the Finnish government and the employees' associations had never been as bad as that of Aho during the porn government.
Now, between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than the Murrostorstad for a while.
Besides, there is now a very porvarial government in Finland, says Coolian.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so tightly rightful, despite the words of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the stainless.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day homes and schools.
Although not receiving undistributed support for employees, it may become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
They're all on the side.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have been hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
The demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of the property, says Cooler.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of the demonstration changed.
The EU's membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get a pig shit on them.
The fireman strike took three months in 1998.
There were also signs of strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical laws in the 1970s
The main strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal strike.
The bill was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received an increase of 16%.
The electricity strike lasted 49 days in the spring of 1977 and caused electrical failures around the country.
Murrostorst in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many of them, who had made the recession unemployed, met for the representation of the parliamentary house, to express their views on the work.
Firemen striked three months in 1998
The fireman strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught by egg rain during the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops" was one of the phrases.
Espale's farmers drove snow tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn haystacks before the meeting place.
The nurses strangled in 1983 and 1995
The nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
Some of the deaths that occurred during the strike in 1995 were coloured by the strike.
The attack threatened with strikes and the resignation of nurses in 2007.
The threat of resignation has finally accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors strangled in 2001
"Doctors at the break - escape", was part of the strike clause of the strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and led to a rigorous discussion on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marching for their student support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliament building in 2013.
Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of Finnish trucks filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police to help out the backgrounds of the Finnish registered refugee truck.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with a truck with 42 refugees.
There is no information on whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
The people on the cold truck were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the scene of the event in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, refugees travelling with a truck in Austria became more fateful.
At that time, 71 passengers on board evidently died by choking.
According to the Austrian public broadcast on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreign-fashioned, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Irakisms have been arrested for human secrecy.
A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug-driver and a smuggling businessman, a story of five smugglers.
Upporikas king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and self-righteous cab driver.
For example, such people engage in human secrecy in the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed tens of smugglers and their "users", and the book The Travel Office of Death will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human secrecy, propose solutions and present smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
The archipelago islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the tunisians are headed for the summer ceremony.
On behalf of their position, the islands also fit excellently for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa belonging to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a burning captain in the chain and a father of six children.
The archipelago islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir's done hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
After spending, Emir earns about 8 000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of tunicians wanted to escape trouble.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis ran out again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will place them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers just survive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer loses the money, it is their problem.
We'll go to the water by midnight.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in 20 metres of high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the destination, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the anoyors to death.
He says in the book that when the police once struck him, he threw all his passengers across the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I was one of the customers on the neck, and I threw them across the edge," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen are going to have to assault this.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
We have to show them immediately who's in charge here.
It's just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Bogovasha in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling at last, and it's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre without their family, men stay in tents, oranges and abandoned cars, which anyone has now managed to find or build.
families living in the forest who have not filed a asylum application in Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the wildernesses, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of cross borders and weekly walks in a difficult landscape, often in mountain areas and dark.
When finally arrived in the territory of Bogovasha, a large human secrecy point, people are fatal.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrians, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best clients are the Syrians, he's in the book.
"They say what they do once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to tink.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, the price will be EUR 300, then fall to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," she says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than others and he's going to charge only EUR 50 per person on Hungary's border.
There are three hundred kilometres of road, mostly the highway.
I hear my colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about €50,000 a year.
It is not a big amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the short paths and takes his rider a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and shine away.
In the work of grace
A 35-year-old congolaism is called Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers who escaped from Congo, and a small centre to help congolics.
In addition to preaching, the Mission preacher is running a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He shines his shoes several times a day and ensures that the white shoulders’ rubber cloth is stylishly curled under the low belt.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrace car, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and moves forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls someone from the Poster’s five phone numbers.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hides the money out of your hands and settles with the shoppers crossing the border.
In order to obtain a refugee or refugee status from the Uganda authorities, it must be said that it is from the war zones of North Kivu, for example, and that it has been forced to escape violence from its home.
Often it is true, but if it isn't, the missionary will organise a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
It helps us contact the Missionary in the Uganda Police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the NGOs, eventually the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become refugees in Uganda.
He invoices each portal separately: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and moving to some European countries, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and icefruits
Tom's a start-up smuggler, an ex-drug criminal.
The 4th-year-old Irish guards on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people to trucks on the way to Britain.
He has an Afghanistan, a French cab driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in a human secret business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 highway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be put in jail for an illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs his customers across the motorway to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they go across the channel across the British.
Tom's picking a suitable truck, we need to make sure that it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and cut off the protective cover.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Well, sometimes the driver's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into a aluminium foil, the same thing that is wrapped around a bakery or oven potato in the kitchen.
It's supposed to stop the police from spotting someone who's hiding.
Some use sleeping bags filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver doesn't drive a sudden smuggler, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Upporical Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undeniable king of the Mediterranean illegal landscape, which controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money available.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship fraud: Turk ports are rented with a snack of fun to take Americans or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded in full by Syrians, Iraqi people, Kurds and Afghanistan, who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to a sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until they are ready to leave.
People get into minibuss and drive someplace on the coast.
They're told to hide amongst vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it's given, we have to get onto the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Maritime Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury trip after the costs.
He does not handle practical things himself, but he hires captains, recruiters, guards, accommodationrs and other smaller ones to do the work on his behalf.
During the summer season, transport is organised at least hundreds and Küçük is making millions.
He is thought to have bought the land, the pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party's representative and a drug entrepreneur.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: This book of the Death Travel Office will be published, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner reports in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, the 500 yard runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about ending his career and being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in the top condition and ran in the cargo for the second best time.
At the final, however, he was panicked.
At the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership on a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself above the goal line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had made a year before Sydney's races, suicide, and he himself felt huge success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of having sex with strange men.
He also confronted his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money in a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline pics as he had received when he competed in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published a article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 3,57.40 in the world's statistical cycle, but remained the last in Sydney's Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance controlled the Norwegian skiing flower: "Superselling"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's skiing union have turned down the whole summer and autumn like last year's athlete agreement.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better agreement than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplication of world champions and an Olympic winner.
The result of the contract dispute was the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
Astrid Jacobsen, a double world champion, received a decision.
He said he was happy that the alliance controlled the ski flower.
"Thank you for showing your spine," wrote Jacobsen in his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow an active athlete to avoid working for the Union's sponsor," he continued.
The argument between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Northug, apparently, would like to be part of a seasonal national team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a covenant that also caring for future generations, and not give one athlete on solo.
At the same time, he reminded me that the Union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published his own release on Tuesday, in which he assured him that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as then in the MM races and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen, in total, won six MM medals, two gold medals.
Last winter, he was involved in a team that won the message gold in Falun.
The shielding day of the bakers is also celebrated in Northland
On the day of the Turtle 25.9, stunts are held in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded a Past Turner's shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finnish high-level food skills and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the meaning of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that all high-level restaurants have not concentrated on the capital region, but that the top restaurants that have been checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the turtles and the organization.
In the northern country, a restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks is held in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town will attend the turtle day.
The event has also attracted significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Setting up the Kauhava reception centre a complaint for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in cooperation setting up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-varustuses currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complainant, the region continues to have a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, the Finnish Erillis nets Ltd.
The Kauhajoki magazine states that, according to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building block would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have an interest in the area of the former Air Military School and the airport, which has no impact on the preparation of the reception centre, it shall write.
The case states that for the last two years in Kauhava, negotiations have been conducted on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Ombudsman that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
The distant city government dealt with the reception center thing last Monday.
Nationality: Syria’s situation reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that immigrants and people here have the necessary conditions, so the societies will comment to the suppliers in the evening after meeting the Chairpersons of all parliamentary parties in their office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern of the management of the refugee situation was aligned with all the participants.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
In particular, at times when we face major challenges
According to the So.Ge.A.AL, the Syrian situation and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The societies are hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the societies, the issue of NATO was also sivued in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media researcher: Sipila takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not want to assess the frequency of the repeated way of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated on the sides of Yle.
If other channels sign up as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech for citizens.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
The pig's taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television talk is not about a more general government-in-house turning.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly and to refuse a public debate on questions? Anu Koivunen, Professor at the University of Stockholm, is concerned.
The recent comment by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin on the fact that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of the democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not connected.
The coyunen understands that the commercial media is disgusted by Sipila's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communications styles are not advisable in democracy.
The role of the media's representatives is to make a specific effort not to adopt politicians' agents as given.
According to coherence, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way or in a different way or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old ones in the permit, it must be wondering why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this respect, it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is stamped as a message from politicians or delegations and governments, which is certainly not in accordance with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A squirrel bet from Sipil
In the future speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media scientist.
The evening should be carefully looked at where Sipila is missing and not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Kuut, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipil, because this is how it can bring up its own view without noises.
This will bring a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike in a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipil passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because more precise questions are not allowed to be raised.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, it's sweating, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government informs about something, because this person is talking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
It's very exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo really considers the speech of the Prime Minister to the citizens as exceptional.
He said that in decades, there has been no such thing that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the forthcoming blackmails.
Employee organisations shall organise demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
The President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter, that Sipila could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sc.), again, announces that he is challenged to the dialogue with Sipila.
We don't have time for the monologs.
It's about six months from the elections.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne's writing on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
THE POIKA IS IN THE TIME AND IN THE KUNN, the son’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finnish Police Department also confirms the issue for the Ilta magazine.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later this evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped us find them.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an amazing balance in such short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildlife of young people: you are anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurditausta freelance fighter, published a video on Facebook, appealing particularly to immigrant-backed young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a heavy speech against young people's street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and a five-year-old with his family in Finland, has so far won both of his professional match in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani says he's got a message that asked him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been downloaded with videos where young people fight with extremely violent taps.
Amirrkhani says he's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other side, and smash eyelessly, without thinking of any of the consequences of this, when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on the videos are immigrants' backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinose, fight videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in the country.
That's exactly what you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants in Finland.
These individual cases have become quite brutal.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you'll be pretty long guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for letting you be here, says Amirkhani.
My Amirkhan urges young people to remember their closest.
If they ever become targeted by some racism, you may blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go with me, guys.
Amirrkhani says that violent action will be contributing to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like.
You're going to be pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter, that the recipient organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings made by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would submit his own proposal to the government to achieve a 5% productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest SAK to soften its previous position.
On the other hand, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in short words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the market lock" and that agreements concluded by the active parties are needed in the position of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Government of Prime Minister Sipile for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
The Sipila earlier closed the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity gap.
Comment: A big point of view threatens to pound - "It's a bit funny to wear a fist"
Well, it feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary in the payee camp from the top to the top.
Is the government supposed to be shouting to revolt, or is it supposed to be settled with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders exploded holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the undermining.
The OAJ threatened by closing schools and day-care homes.
Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK Organisation, appeared conciliatively.
He said that he kept in touch with the government and had prepared the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) for a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Kok), the president of the schedule, has prompted immediately to announce that his reconciliation paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to settle when the federal leaders just on Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK will seek solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipila's government.
The right hand of the fire, head of STTK's social impact, Jukka Ideus, formerly acted as Special Assistant for Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire is characterized by the fact that the government's ay-skills have improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but the fire exit took a bit off the Finnish standouts, whose coincidence is the ACP Marko Pirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duuma president, Sergei Naryshk, criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duuma President, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the September session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Narysh also made extensive comments on the July Helsinki Conference.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to the meeting of the European Union's sanctions, to the issue that the President was going to remind journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news office, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became a complicated one, so Naryshkin continued to squeeze Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for "good organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting that was held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that Parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met an Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), leading to the meeting at Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff trophy: "Present paintings"
Killpara and Luukko continue in Hakamets today for bull days when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today, in Hakametsa, there's no real goal party.
Killpara went to Kuopio last night to chase a 3-2-foot win from Kalpa.
The rise was manly, because the silver group of the last season was the worst of the two goals in the loss station.
The lock Tuesday was a better molest winner.
The Raumani catch was the guest of Blues, who was retired, with round zero points, and loss figures as well as 2-3.
Tough game, the goals in tight, if any plays the same game as last year, the Lock-Blower Janne Lahti anticipates the positions on the sides of the club.
The killer has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the creeps.
In the last two years, Tappara has just fallen from the final series of Luko.
On both occasions, a crucial seventh match has been required.
During the last season, the lock took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next sides and over.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, except in the case of paint vacuums.
The casinos who rejected both of you yesterday will receive a slope shift today.
On the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: The apocalypse is running
Sports director Toivola handwriting an inappropriate extension to the main trainer Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky film where he was acting as the main part.
The subconscious sent a sensational campus with the heavyweight series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola handwrited a restless ash story to Pori.
Anonymous and wooden paddle made a surprise for everyone at the SM Finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but stiff pools like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop game, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Hopela was one of the heroes.
The manwriter Hopela believes that the news work of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who has just worked as a sports manager has built a pope for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have ruined the giants in the chamber like Rocky's pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kupariis are worth some other than a linguistic game.
Hopela has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main part is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Collar Sean Connery.
The Iron Kallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original session in the Rocky of Hopela.
There's no other name than Rocky in the iron calculus.
The game philosophy of the iron calculus is not part of rushing and swinging.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
Last year, the Ace Garret Stafford threw the Tapper Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2 plus 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put him in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an ace hockey, a hot-rolled Raud Kallio twisted after the game for the people of the Satakunta.
The team of the recent season has been oddly built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, jackasss.
There aren't practically key players in the best game age.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the players' acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the procurement and unfortunately, the market situation was rather limited, the Iron Collion responded diplomaticly.
It's underneath the surface.
The yearly model of 1953 The Iron Collective is known to be interested in moving to Hopela to a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance in the three league games of the season is equal to a number of losses in the difference in painting 1-6.
Hopelan would not have been worthwhile writing the further part.
Olga Temonen is acting like Sipe Santapuk's mother.
Olga Temonen will reveal that if he had met his husband when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen, for the first time acting in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna You made us beautiful in the movie is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
The circa tsemppa and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (which is presented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of mind.
The more I've seen my true image in Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has come closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone, communicated.
The circa has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
And fortunately, we also understand that the drama is a drama and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga underlines that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really nasty.
There was a pretty small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth from Tuuka before the movie plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skate.
Olga was a day and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the highest level, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga said he's been working so hard with Tuuka in 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production team will go to Heinola for a month.
Although Iiti’s couple is often planning to drive home for the night because it is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have warmly accepted us, only asked which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
The budget of the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, guided by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Vuorensola begins to film the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's follow-up, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive film in Finland all the time with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously on the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in place will also rise after the Iron Sky 2 is completed, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa start in October near Antwerp near AED Studios and last eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare you.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I'm so relaxed about a fictional manuscript because I know exactly what kind of a movie should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, and he'll tell the evening magazine.
Initially, 8 to 10 million were planned for the budget of the film, but as the manuscript evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million would be allowed to enter the film because each angle and power is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loose ends.
On Wednesday, Iron Sky Universe, a film production company launched a mass-finance campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and by supply during the campaign.
At least two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The activity film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What's up? Or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the Trends have recently decorated the big logos.
Another time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsa in a conspiracy.
Advertising the cuckoo or t-shirt marks was seen somewhat as a cuckoo.
But the times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports stamps such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness wave brush.
And as so often before, a funny and trendy border is shining: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
At first, the standard core practice, the tavis fashion, where the trenders were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a means to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey base college, it already buryed on the bottom of the cabinet with a look at the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas trackers, the favorite team's gambling shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logs are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from athletics to luxury bands.
For example, the chest of Versace's sculpture makes it clear what kind of dress it is.
Would you be ready to introduce the logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn't stick in the tank for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which was held in Russia Arms Expo, which presented the products of the Russian military industry.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotovia from the tank block for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to squeeze a tanker from the door in a very good atmosphere, and at least on the basis of these images, it is not about falling or getting mad.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a battle tank, but it was a raid tank of BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in Ural.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolska and Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel, in his exhibition, the new engineering of Russia, because he was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I was thrilled for our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all the tanks and all the rushpant wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the editor who wrote it as a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and rotting, but nothing that I would've stuck somewhere in the tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
The words of Zotov support the fact that no photograph of the alleged imprisonment has been published, although in a few days there were a total of 50,000 people at the weapons exhibition.
The argument that Zotov was stuck started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told that he ripped out of the tank hole while trying and threatened to finally shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way he sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

Agnico Eagle Finland’s Kittilän mine has been leaked by a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand in its yard.
According to the company, measures to remedy the leakage have begun.
In the pool there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foam process.
Usually water is pumped for re-use as process water or is managed in accordance with authorisation through the surface coating field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the material came into the environment.
The leakage was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been detected to cause structural damage to pool patches.
The company tells us that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report, published by the International Monetary Fund, published today by the IMF, respects largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization was confronted with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuopamäki, Danske Bank's main economist, structural reforms are in agreement, but there are little differences.
The IMF's assessment of the government's activities has a great deal of sympathetic message, but on the other hand there are also words of the warning on what should not be too much cut.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% for this year, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today that growth will remain zero this year when the new cycle is predicted.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported the total production in the summer in a small growth rate, says Kuopamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the difference is only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, under the authority of Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, started his work on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for a successful Wii Console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible successors of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research Analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to be seen by taking Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gambling consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
The Swedish Immigration Service already acknowledged in February 2015, that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their websites, according to the Swedish Migration Office, hundreds of minors disappear annually.
Inspector Juha Kannelmaa, the Immigration Agency, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear from "lower country" per year?- In 2013 a total of 156 minors received a single application for asylum.
They disappeared from nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and they disappeared from 11, Kannelmaa reports.
In the context of the disappearance, it can be found that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been found to be full-age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014 the applicants for asylum in Finland had a total of 3651 persons, of whom 134 of whom the application was made because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for asylum from a minor alone.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is well known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have been given a decision?
Are they lost, for example, in the "blind labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the appeal decisions, Kannelmaa.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered countries.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU Ministerial Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - look at the pictures of the equipment.
Because of the seizures, Timo T.A. Mikkosen's equipment for television and radio production is now sold.
Mikkosen's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment in Huuto.net, which were the most advanced professionals in his field.
The Internet report was the first one that reported the Internet magazine Iltamacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs will no longer be filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these too are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasms - collectors and their own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Michaels are trying to move away from their current Storm East home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent a bit of trouble and see what things are being given up.
That's what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer a personal use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real lifework was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials in the box store from Stormskylä.
Traffic threatens to fall worse than thought: Metro and tramways can stop for the whole Friday
The metro and tramway drivers today decide whether or not they extend forces in relation to the recession of Friday.
The original plan was to stop the subway and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, you'll figure out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Truster Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly squeezing drivers, so the government's plans to cut the lizards raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that stopping transport all day is a dilemma.
If the subway and tramways stand by Friday, public transport is practically almost completely stopped in the capital area.
According to VR, trains do not travel on Friday between 6:00 and 6:00 in the morning.
On Friday, there's no traffic in the nearest or in the distance.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the fortress.
The members of the ACP will be gone from work on Friday from 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven; they will be driven by superiority, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo assumes.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell us exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employees' organisations will be organizing a demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Theatre on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used tears gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the AP News Office.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border aid.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, escaped in the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tyres against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, a 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher kept him at school a self - deciding watch bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he was just trying to show him the output of his electronics.
But one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the youth arrest cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police, but it was known to be composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days in forced leave from school.
His father is furious and the American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is another evidence of islamophobia in the United States.
United Kingdom on - Labour Director refused to sing the national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent to the monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also joined the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has been insulted by the people, suspected by the Labour Advocate Kate Green broadcaster at the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
The last Memorial was respected for the British Air Force Flighters’ fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroicity of royal airpower pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect during the national song, and the opinion stressed.
Corbyn's choice as a party leader has divided the labour lines.
Especially among the representatives of the people who are afraid to expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, cessation of savings and increasing public expenditure.
Corbyn is due to be present today for the first time in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron rode in a weekly Twitter on Corbyn's choice as a party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and our family safety, and the Prime Minister televisioned on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota’s family death is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a case.
South Lake Minnetonka's police have soon investigated the family death in Minnesota Greenwood.
A five - souled family was found dead in his home on 10 September and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife with a shotgun and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police went to the house to check and found a huge house on all sides of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a successful company
The South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses designed to social media on the site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014 at the StarTribune interview Short said there were four million different visitors per week.
I've been offered 50 purchases in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011, by the Short’s family buying a hulpe house in Greenwood with two million dollars.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are only 12 rooms in the house, including eight cars in sufficient garage.
The case is underway.
According to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various preppaus courses, had challenged him to court because of the comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments were deleted from Short's website and therefore had lost customers to its competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on the short business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee.
In addition, the owner-thirds were awarded at the dietary event by the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner award.
That's great. Loiri's commenting on his good-looking desk.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused with Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think that's happened.
According to Loir, the Coach of Successshevose will receive full peace with the horse while working with him.
It's the stack and decide where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri squeezed.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens’ superstar P. K. Subban has contributed $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the medical news, this is the largest athlete of all time in Canada for charity.
In addition, Subban, 26 years of age, is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with Canadiens eight years ago and $72 million worth a year ago.
Subban’s contribution is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars.
Subban receives a titled lobby from the hospital for its award.
The players in Canadiens have used to help local hospitals significantly before.
One year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same childcare hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital, which gave the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese coffee can order a wife's evening, serves only bikini and bikini.
The diamond cafeteria is a tough deal in Japan.
There's already a goat coffee shop, a cannabis cafe, a vampire coffee shop, a hay coffee shop, and now a wife coffee shop.
It hits the lonely, the cravings and the hunger.
The Metro told me about it.
A coffee from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my wife) can be ordered for a wife or husband's evening.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Poliso" will be selected from the list before the coffee shop comes, and he will prepare and serve the food.
The wife is opposed to just a gadget and bikini on top, and a husband in a tight bikehorses.
The website offers all the information about the length and pressure of the wife candidates to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep.
Soon, 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against automobile security began to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the Intel release reports.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and distribute online data.
We can, and we need to improve cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is a major component in the design of each vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
The Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in the processing of information.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as a moon rising.
Eventually, the car is starting to be in the vicinity of Finland.
Ford published RS information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerating with 2,3 litres of 350 horsepower engines in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed in 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, it is originally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when they report.
The favorite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - these are the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish, it is certainly more important than two new news, the new Sportage of the fourth generation, where Kia intends to capture a larger wing from the ever-growing streets market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaum, created by Sportage, is rounder than before.
One inch has come to the axle intermediate and outward dimensions, and the car is going to crack more efficiently.
The engine range is mainly unchanged, but it has been added to a turbo with 1,6 litres of horse power.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported to be closer to the sales.
It has to be waited a little longer, as we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the year's change, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Quickly, the news doesn't seem to change, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of high-speed buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher levels of equipment.
At first, Optimas with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of gasoline engines are obtained.
Next summer the pace will accelerate when an Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
At the same time, with its income, the sales of Optima-farmar begins.
Chisu came back to the stages and blew in a brave hustle.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neckhole in the electric blue trouser suit.
The costume is beautifully introduced by the singers in the star's siro belt.
The whole is crowned by golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During three years of the break, a singer who became a mother has gained the kg of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish a new and fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternal style is reluctant again... now you can see the chest.
The true-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics of each other.
She presents her childhood stomach and breast-fibrely in sexy clothes last night at 1 A.M. time when she left her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, her husband, Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored brass under the dress when lighting lights.
The last time Kardashian dressed up in amateur maternity suit when he went to her friend's dinner invitations in New York just a few days ago.
The chart was highlighted by the black overgeneration boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift had its way of pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Mano Leloup wanted a short idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Public dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season begins from nowhere.
Even if you'd posed in top designers' costumes during the previous season, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season comes new, fresh faces that compete for work with constables.
The models rarely have a place they can call a home.
The work is continuing to travel and can take a year to have a hotel room or apartment to which fashion halls accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop a pound, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
For fashion philosophy models and designers are all the time together and operate as the same support network.
When the fashion logs run out, the difference is odd.
The models want it to be given to this sector for the opportunities it offers, but they feel that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Even the models want to be their own person.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with some role.
But you can also express yourself in your model's work.
You were on the Tory Burch show last night.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers reveal their designs next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulant musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala, in the Apulanta group, based on the first years.
In 1991, the lautala set up Apulanna with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rapist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to the people, so I think it's good to learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to do a human implication.
A man who can trust the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is completely empty, doesn't go to the role.
The Punk maneuvers come with the man in nature.
The stars, the stars, in the punk period, surely many saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, you were announced today by the main actors of the beautiful film, the Tuukka Temose, who called the basso.
The group of nuclear teams that are familiar with the band is still quite unknown to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki performs Teppo Manner, singer of Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo Based on Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future debris last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
Roope, seen in the mustache and the jaw beard, has turned his face into siloposk, and coloured his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or should you tell me about it at all?
There is no need to take this up forcefully, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises the psychologist.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and trouble, he says.
However, if a child has encountered a TV newsletter about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about it.
It is good to have a discussion on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that parents think he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're embarrassed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves stay calm during the discussion, the child will feel safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter a discussion of refugees in school, friends or online.
Parents should be happy to take this into consideration with them if they think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world aren't doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how our family feels about this.
However, in the end, do we think that the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have a variety of educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from distress wherever possible.
On the other hand: If a family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

My powers at the end?

It's hard to control the Vermonic Ball Salama
Pertty North got a slice of Apila's Ball salama in the middle of the summer.
It only dramatized profits and second places until the collapse occurred in the Tampere rays at the end of July.
Since the Ori was completely defyed, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian to his guard.
The explanation of the shutdown was cleared in the inauguration.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the weakest in the head, but it took two drug cubes to defeat it.
Since Apilan Ball Salama had to be undergoing mild exercises, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE station in Turku after the Taruntuule.
Apila's Ball Salama was very pressured when it had only been able to drive for a few weeks.
These things, considering a small tendency at the end, were understandable, says North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made steel for the Ori.
I'm sure the horse's vire went ahead of it, and I hope it would have even balanced.
Apila Ball Salama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been amusing, it could've thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori has removed a lightning letter that the opponents have been wondered.
In short speed, turtles can't handle the Balloon Hall, from which even the warm bloody rides can be released.
In the north's hopes, Vermo's got a spear run.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Ballsalama agrees.
It's kind of difficult at the time of departure, and it might be a swing under the hood of the driveway and something like that.
I hope the Ori would be more calm than Turku would go.
Apila Ballsalama can also come from the bow while in order, and we are going to drive it from the victory, the coach's license.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs on Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple intends to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips will come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a forced update on iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone applications are in close association with other programmes.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating it because the company does not want to waste memory space on user iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area's consumer prices rose only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-years, said the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat today.
The increase in prices was lowered by the cost of energy.
Eurostat thus revised a few weeks' interval of 0,2% of its estimate slightly downwards.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% of 1.0% of July in August.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
In the EU-28 countries, the average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most from the euro area, i.e. 1.4% in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was low as prices decreased by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percentage increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year the rise will rise to 1.1%, and the central bank expects the new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed will try to blackmail monetary policy next
The next recession in the United States begins at a speed of less than a year, but surely within three years after the NCB Fed again starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And on the financial market, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rates should be initiated by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at the earliest autumn and before that as a rate of financial markets.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's biggest economy and financial markets act as they have used to do, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank’s Strategies of the London Market Survey Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive investigation of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a survey report on Long-Term Asset Return Study on over 60 pages to its international large customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
On the other hand, they play with the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the markets have previously acted during and after the Fed interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key economic and financial markets are now in the same or other model as at the time of previous interest rates - and possibly what will happen.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a more odd position to endure the increase in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Not a year to the beginning of the recession.
The leaders decided on Fedi's monetary policy and its subsequent incitement have suggested that the time is beginning to grow up in interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can be reached this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Board of the Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds guiding interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular, but at the same time 0,25 percentage points of interest, which Fed raised from 1,25 % to 5,25 %, ended up at the same time as two years.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ripped off into a global judgment nightmare.
The major recession came from 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial market and the real economy began slowly than has typically occurred since the previous Fede interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsch's strategies have screened the rises and declines in the world's major economies and the fluctuations in the financial market since 1950 and in place since the beginning of the 18th century.
Since the 1950s, they are making clear about Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts.
At the beginning of the recurrence, the first interest rate has taken the fastest period of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate of the financial market has ended within one or two years of the beginning of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has on the occasion raised and on the occasion lowered its steering rate to a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time, there is a relatively limited difference between some and others, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certainty on the effects of the following interest rates.
Strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Interests too low for too long
Without the crucial causes of the financial crisis, the culprits may not be unquestionably identified even by decades of research.
But for the reasons leading to the crisis and raising its destructiveness, there must be some unquestionably clear evidence:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world's largest central banks held their interest rates too low.
They mounted the tracks of the technique, while growing up the next one.
2) Over the decades, over the different parts of the financial and real economy, the debt volume of the central banks increased even more over the monetary policy impact.
The biggest debt bubble of economic history was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing entailed the most financial markets' components of the financial economy's major price bubbles from shares to real estate, debt books and commodities.
It is hardly a very difficult argument that the high-level financial market for more complex debt shortfalls was rarely dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
In addition to the financial structures triggered by the debt lines, the valuation bubbles were not lasting until their time after the interest rates had begun and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche Strategies do not realize what is going to happen next, but give us the topic of nuclearism by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Liability has not been crazy for a long time as ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Therefore, the debt cargo for the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but in various parts of the economy, the debt burden is much more severe than before the financial crisis or ever before.
3) Liquidity issued from the former lower and cheaper central banks has remained mostly on the financial markets and has slowed down the key securities and assets most expensively before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only with financial market warning signals, they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the most severe recession to the model that has taken place.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks in the financial market are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is next to tightening its downfalls.
Perhaps the French bank Societe General's strategy Albert Edwards' future picture is not as strange as it may suddenly affect.
For a long time, he has trained the bank's international investor clients for the following translations:
First, Fed raises interest, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fedin is about to squeeze financial fires with even bigger QE-shoes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), manufacturing computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted by the HP business service provider, the company explains.
HP is distributed in November to the HP Inc., the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on company sales, and to consumers.
The staff of HP was highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the single costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions of the consumer will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating performance.
In the last year, the three main customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after the Apple update
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings application, clicking "Universal" and then selecting "Provision Update".
If the update is ready, the phone allows you to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the "Protect Update failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
In order to overlook this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user in the end process.
This may include removing applications for a space, but Apple has reduced this opportunity by lowering the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes removable applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update, so that the battery is not finished.
If the download level is too low, Apple does not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery is running out, it may result in a failure to update.

It is also worth making sure that you have been through our list of all the things you need to do before download, so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with you new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and enormously new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that accelerate and correct the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has operated in the Government of the Tax Paradics Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Government of the Tax Paradics Company.
According to the above, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company, appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he has submitted a notice of resignation for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains will take place in a agreed timetable, Berner says at the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who joined the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was in Karelia-Upofloor’s government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs’ government and in Luxemburg.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs pass through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he received a member of the government at the Luxemburgi company, at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the capital interests of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company has no tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established in the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs already had a capital fund for the ownership of Triton, a holding company of Luxemburg.
Espoo opens the reception centre operated by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company in Espoo Otaniem is open for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from six o'clock this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to up to 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy are agreed, inter alia, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative workplace blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the work of the government.
The organisation also wishes other employees' centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently being given in the remarks of Friday.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization's administration meeting on a break to the suppliers.
The Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economists of the STTK have calculated that the change security included in the government competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a one-off relationship to a hundred sides of it is a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation.
Palola: Consultation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, since the government is to present a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to start preparing the reforms.
The Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is real.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive of him all the time.
According to Palola, the STTK Agency for the field is a sick place, especially for Sunday passes.
The organisation requires the government to retreat forced legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, the Palo does not provide for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the workplace blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first day of sickness are cut, overtime payments are half-uped, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK underlines that the central organisations have called employees into a demonstration and have not been intended to strike.
The Open Fjäder Thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder thanks the STTK for preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, as the plan has already set out an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package because without the SAK, the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, president of the schedule, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare the proposal for an alternative for surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it has long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitive jump pursued by the government as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for the government's presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on the content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, talkoos," playing bingo when Sipila talks tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Vivan bingokuponki, the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Yle on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the corresponding previous talk, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in the course of the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
The President and ministers then held a number of radio speeches during the winter and future war.
In the 1990's, Esko Aho gave a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train-person strike with a television speech.
Alone, monarchism
Sipila's speech has raised all day's criticisms and conjectures about what to come.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said: "Sipila could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, people listening.
In Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judge condemned the fact that "monarchism: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for them".
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipile's dialogue: "After six months from the elections.
There's no presentation from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's with the fear of @Juhachila?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on in direct transmission by the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Hääkämies.
It's a noble one who's been judged to make Sipilä's speech.
We considered the issue and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote the whole of Finland's comprehensive publicity, a line in the news by the Director of Yle's publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we're at the Tammelos
The speech has also provoked abusiveness.
After tonight, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be combed and dressed for the best.
My mom puts on the nicest piece and my dad's gonna settle the tie on her neck.
At nine o'clock, they'll shut up on TV like before we used to be at the Tammelo's time," writes Saku Timonen.
"Do Prime Minister Sipila also mention why the government of Finland is sitting in the tax paradises of millionaires that hide their capitals, who are making laws for mercy to his other tax collectors, and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the government has no money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by Viva Green Left at the University of Tampere.
It's been published on Facebook by a bingo.
Are we hearing about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries opposed the Russian proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer, whereby the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been given up the power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaar, the United Nations ambassador of Russia proposed a plan for al-Assad to be stylish after some time.
The Western countries did not, however, take the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaar, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in the two-way debate, listed three points of plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the resignation of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we will be able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, Sit down, Mart, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the newspaper, but Ahtisaare said there were no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused to take over all the agreements he would have taken over.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responds to the speeches of Ahtisaare, because Russia was not at any time prepared to discuss the destiny of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
In Ahtisaar's argument, I weakened that Tshurk spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that Putin's shark would have held power in some of the supporters of Al-Assad.
The Refugee flow of our own works
During the negotiations in the Ahtisaar, about 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee from their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay the bill that we caused ourselves, the Ahtisaari will tell the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' organisation centre in Tornio
The asylum seekers' organisation centre, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be founded in the empty building of the Tornion colony in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place for better management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsingin Sanomat reported that the Board had already decided to present a school building for a state solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hööpinen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, that is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the teams wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
During the local debate, 36 were authorised from 43.
The Arrangement Centre was opposed to 13 officials.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, says Tuppinen.
According to the city leader Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and was rapidly responded.
It would be estimated that 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspecting that it might be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wishes a job market option for blackmails
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the pooling of holiday money in public would only be carried out by a part of the government's desire to lower the price of work.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners were able to agree on that.
Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament that he had not contacted the social partners.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for substitutes for the pressures of work reported by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipila's view, the pooling of holiday money would be a tool, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday tickets for the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present these views on next Wednesday to Parliament on the stresses of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipila, the proposals made by organisations should be known beforehand.
And this isn't the end of the line.
Legislative work will then move, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long to see if there's a will, Sipilä shaped it.
The list published by the Government last week includes, inter alia, the conversion of the lobby and the helatorstat to unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for the first day of sickness is cut, the overtime allowance is half-up, the Sunday allowance is reduced to 75% and the holiday is reduced.
The reforms are implemented as forced legislation over trade unions, which has brought strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, workers' centre organisations organise a demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Council of the Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the stock of the juice hall
The Tohmajärvi Council adopted unanimously, but slightly the extension of the stock of the mahlahalli, which is the rule of Nordic Koivu Oy.
The assessment was caused by the project being bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for order was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the sub-annual report.
The agenda was still talking about the investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000, but the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local authorities.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a lease, Vesa Västö (ps.) justified.
Even the Karelian place in Joensuu
The city government relieved its steepest position to bring pasture street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of upholding the herd tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared to be the capital of the cattle language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the cattle is naturally part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more than part of the eastern savage fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the language of the cattle, for example, in the information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-speaking municipality, it is also worth a wide-ranging approach to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturality is living and changing strongly in the North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specialities of the county, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used to make use of the various types of marketing in the region.
Train connections cut off the region’s vitality
Train connection surgery strikes the region's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business and competitiveness.
And it affects whether we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights airlines, which has continued several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not manage to reduce our opportunities by government measures, as it is now happening.
The impact of these termination of transport links, for example, on employment, should be considered, emphasised by the Karelian.
The deterioration of transport links will give the University of Eastern Finland an additional challenge for attractiveness.
Of course, the better services are here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that bad transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels much because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, the recruitment manager, says that the marketing of the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in a cross-sectional direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently coming from outside of Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuus became one of my noises to the war of Siu
Joensuu City Government's view of the National Siu Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of my noises is amongst me.
Pentti Centralsalo (i.e., picture), member of the city government, presented the resignation of the entire project at the board’s Monday meeting, but his presentation was ineffective.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjai draft decision, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvolaan ends next year
Passenger train transport from Kotkasta to Kouvolaan will remain in the future, although one train shifter is less than one.
Passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will be subject to changes next March.
One train shifter stays out, but five times a day still gets to Kotka Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to public savings.
For the next four years, the purchase money of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys livin' off the ground.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climb on the roof, who couldn't get down on the roof by his own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketoway at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two-layer wooden house in which there are no ladders to take to the roof at all.
It did not prevent the crowd of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the masks of radiomasters next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the other travellers flipped out of the place and alerted the rescue facility to help safely return to the surface of the last on the roof.
FedEx's operating profit is double, declining the outlook of the tax year 2016
The FedEx reports depressing results from its last quarter, and the supply leaves cut all year’s projections, due to the deterioration of demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire about 55 000 season workers for holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 season workers for holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening time.
According to FedEx Corp, it is expected to end next May as a result of a tax year of USD 10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84, let's see the FactSet survey.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, the smaller outlook came in spite of the higher premiums for land transport of heavy or large packages that started in November.
The company said that it would expect business profits to increase from the previous year, because they have cut costs, turnover has grown and online trade is growing.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "supports firmly, taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries during the holiday were published on the day after the competitor UPS said that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came at $2.42, which remains at the average forecast of USD 2.44. The survey of 12 analysts carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the evolution of its Express turnover.
However, the increase in online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the country unit rose by 29 per cent, but the income of the operations was in principle the same due to the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic fees, while higher labour costs were reduced by the operating profit.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening time, FedEx's shares fell to $3.85, which is 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent below the 11th of June record.
The US central bank decision-makers will sit this week for two days around the giant mayonnaise table at the long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time to almost a decade.
On the other side of the central bank's decorative two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map reminds us that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Congress has given the central bank two responsibilities: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the heads of the central bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the information indicates that the economy is rising firmly, recent droughts in the global financial markets may have made the already precarious NCB officials more frightened, as far as instability increases are concerned.
"Intelligently, labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a major economic expert in Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they seek to justify leaving the interest rate level alike, there is an increased uncertainty in the world market that is sufficiently qualified for waiting yet," he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which already leads to nervousness in the economy.
According to the recent study of Bloomberg, approximately half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
However, the financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that there is only about 30% of growth.
This indicates a decrease in the securities market if the central bank increases the level unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the attack by promising that the next lift will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599.85.
The expectation that the central bank maintains the level this week was accompanied by the recovery, reports John Lonski, the main economic expert of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest, "they need to see a lot of effort in their direction to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that the increased level would relieve the financial market because it would eliminate uncertainty about the time when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago it seemed that the central bank would increase the interest rate this month by one quarter, thus taking the first small step towards slow tightening the financial situation, which would confirm the stability of the United States' recovery.
In spring and from the beginning of summer, he has observed that he expects a level to rise this year, despite the need for further economic development by the Liberals in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest number for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of stimulation.
Although inflation is still below the annual objective of the Central Bank of 2%, the NCB’s decision-makers believe that it has a significant temporary impact on the price of low oil.
The economy "is clear of higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the strict situation in the labour market", says Pantheon Macroeconomics, the main economic expert of Ian Shepherdson.
However, the global financial market was shocked last week when China devaled its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record, when investors feared that the Chinese slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the maize peak figure.
For CB decision-makers, market failure is an additional factor in a complex equation which states that the interest rate should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks on the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they do not have much information about the consequences of the Chinese events", says Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the ECB's influence has been tremendous.
In 2013, the President-in-Office, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could "develop" the increase in the amount of money, caused distortions on the market around the world.
In the world where markets and economies are increasingly blurred, officials of the central bank are expected not only to develop elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted its financial markets, which has appeared to be separated from the basic economic factors."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has decided, has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions, "without the limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth", Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank revoked these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as was the case when the markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the former member of the Bank of England's interest rate determination committee.
The last assault isn't even close to its level, Posen says.
"No one wants a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the markets are harmed", says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Law of the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) still holds a two-like requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I believe that they should not expect it.
You miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown.
This trade/inventory was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai Costcon, is a thai store that also sells to the private.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
Trade/inventory is a single stop store offering a dizzy range of fresh, frozen and dried commodities, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture, religious and celebrity decorations.
There is even a car department in the store if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to circulate all the hallways.
If the sale makes you hungry, you can eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food shop (good, cheap) is close to the bags, and there are several pick-up food options.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
Products have been priced reasonablely and a large proportion of the products are sold in wholesale packaging.
The fresh products provide Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat desk is wide, the same fish desk. The staff will clean and file the fish behind the dish and, if necessary, also cook it for you.
A large part of the movement has been reserved for a huge freezer compartment, where you can find frozen curry leaves, haircurrants and galanas, whole ducks, fish, bovine meat and biscuits, pork leather, fish balls, local sausages, meals and other.
Whoever shops: The owners of the restaurant and you cooked, but also individual families and individuals.
It's the same as the shopping carts and the trunks.
Finding: Fresh monthong durioth next to the cashier.
Where it is located: The store is located in the factory area of Los Angeles near Chinatown and the centre facilities a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area to be distributed with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be busy, the parking lot is usually easily found.
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization, SPRS, has invented a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good food during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
The breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide all the nutrients needed for babies to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories with about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that the increase in calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
The recent study led by professor Robert Waterland of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was shown to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is the favorite viewers, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to news the lead display in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's assault to the news of the Liberal Party's exploration failed to increase today's number of viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull dismantled Tony Abbott.
The contestable program of Sunrise, led by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped in London as part of the series of its weekly international broadcasts covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara falls and Cancun.
The distance cargo did not seem to interfere with Australian TV viewers, since the average viewer value of Sunris was 397 000 in 5 capitals of the state when today's figure was 339 000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise in the last few months.
In August today's average was 318 000 and Sunris 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, the average number of Sunris is 349 000, while today's number is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in winds are blowing this morning outside Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 series of words, with the former Packed to the Rafters series of stars Erik Thomson, a marvelous premiere.
A new drama series that gathered a very impressive average of 1,219 million viewers reports of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series is the bearing force alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
The The X Factor programme was a strong 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
The Seven Channel had a double fate on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new philosophy programme gathered 446 000 viewers on average.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour number was dizzy 720 000.
The average hot Seat was 620 000.
The Chase Australia’s average viewer value in the second night brings confidence in the Nine channel that at the end of the Hot Sea will eventually become the most popular programme at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme that failed to reduce the number of viewers of the McGuire programme.

The final triangle agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The remaining three girls aren't really gonna drop who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before three became two, they could give an unintended indication of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed before Thursday's finale.
All three women were cast into poetry by telling them how Wood is a perfect man, referring to his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness for the reasons why they would like to be his partners.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not to you, whom should it go?", their answers could offer a revealion of who won the son's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been incomplete since the first day.
"After I walked into the house, (Sarah) the energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind all the time," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really on the ground, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel nice and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good partner.
Mackay said last week's visits made him realize that Wood could be "that's right."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with my whole heart in this," he said.
When you ask who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls left as much as I like, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. on Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coachs would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the end of the game after the Australian Rugbyligan turnover dropped the ball when the first swing was returned to the team when the team was won in Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next flight and took him to the run game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's real character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new new enthusiasm a battalion in front of another team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
And Jarryd Hayne dropped the explosion Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man to NFL Debyy.
Haynen was seen screaming on the way out of the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio parachute Hamish & Andy about the 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 10.4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start of his NFL career.
"It was now just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared its fracture to his 2007 Origin debut when the feed on his own goal zone led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo published in his Instagram account, holding the Australian flag with the fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when the police shot rubber bullets against demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old sons, died in Nepal, South, when a policeman shot rubber bullets into a crowd that showed his view against the new Constitutional proposal in the country, on Wednesday, the Authority reported.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandusta.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the senior official of the region, said that over 1,000 demonstrators had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tears gas and then fired the air before using rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous option appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the recent weeks of violent demonstrations, it was a merger across the southern provinces of Nepal, where the members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in the West Nepal when the Tharus group calls for its own country.
After August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of which have been cops.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement on the distribution of the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards the new Constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed by the devastating earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted this week on the constitutional clauses of Katmandussa, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
The US National Hurricane Centre NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane
On the low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southern part of the Cape Verde island group, 60% of the chance to develop a tropical hurricane during the next 48 hours was reported by the US National hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
The second specific low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical cycling storm over the next two days, added the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google will start the donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees in Europe fleeing from war-breaking and poverty countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its blog of the donation campaign.
Instead of making a statement from the Director, the Google worker Rita Masoud, who escaped from Kabul with his family when he was seven years old, wrote about his personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the crisis of refugees and immigration in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Gifts will receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, save children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it corresponds with the same amount to every donation made on the Google.com/refugeerelief globally up to 5.5 million dollars, with a total target of USD 11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been going on since World War II, which is mainly due to the four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dilution surgery can help mildly obese diabeteses
According to the new study, the benefits of a mildly obese type 2 diabetes mellitus surgery may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to tell if these mildly obese diabeteses live after dialect surgery longer than those treated in other ways than surgery.
Dr. Robin Blackstone says, "To obtain mortality information takes a long time," he's a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a headline in a new JAMA Surgery magazine.
Dilution or bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery have been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved have been ill fat and their body weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person's BMI is more than 30, he is considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in Taiwanian Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatrist surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and a reduction in gastrointestinal gastrointestinal treatments, for type 2 diabetes medication in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained mostly the same in 29.
36% of the cut-offs had a full improvement and 28% partial improvement.
Due to comparative treatment, diabetes was fully improved by only 1% and partially by approximately 2% in the treatment group.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the bad LDL cholestero "were generally better in the surgery group", the writers said.
Investigators also monitored the levels of haemoglobin A1c in patients reflecting blood sugar levels in the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Following surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the pharmaceutical group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
This better "glycaemic control", described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between the two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared with the abdominal cavity surgery group, the group in the gastrointestinal surgery had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more weight index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and had more likely achieved a complete diabetic remission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that even though the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where the surgery led to longer life in more severe people.
In a Swedish study, it was found that overdrug fattening patients in the dialect surgery had a 29% lower likelihood of death during a period of 15 years compared to a group that had been experimenting with more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 and interested in surgery.
"The results of the investigation are crucial just in showing that surgery is safe for the lower body weight index", he says, and there is no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time of the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," she says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Not all can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The Head of the Buddhist of Tibetan has called for the abolition of violence in the countries of refuge.
Dalai Lama dealt with the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, which was dedicated to ethics research.
In the present situation, Dalai Lama argued that the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, although the answer to the refugee crisis needs to be admired by the Western European countries, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, it is necessary to consider long-term solutions: how real peace and real development can be brought into these Muslims, mainly through education.
The ultimate point is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
When taking a position on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response in the United States caused serious events in the chain.
"Before my letter, I gave my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used the strength and it created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
During the last four years, the swallowing of the child’s hand-driven agent has increased to four times
The toxicological data centres across the United States have reported a strong increase of almost 400% in the swallowing of an alcoholic hand-infundant for children under 12 years since 2010, reports Georgia’s toxicological information centre.
According to PhD Gaylord Lopez, the director of the toxicological information centre of Georgia, the cases reported in the toxicological data centres for the swallowing of disinfectant in children under 12 years of age rose from the case in 2010 to the case in 2014 16117.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them is due to the emergency policy," said Lopez to CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap rise.
According to the reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to make a stronger drink.
The fragrances of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think it's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those that have been added to.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", head of the University of Kansas Medical Centre, Mr Stephen Thornton, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey shovel on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left visible, and if the children are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who, some time ago, swallowed only four strawberries of strawberries in a school with hand disinfectants, and was taken to emergency aid.
Her blood levels of alcohol were 179, which is twice the limit of adult drinking, Chris Ritchey, first-aid clinic, who treated her at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When you were talking to Nhaijah, he couldn't walk when he arrived for an emergency.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital for possible cerebral injuries, because alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," said Nhaiyah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are combined with death.
In 2013, two ontario women died after swallowing a toxic, undisclosed ingredient of the hand disinfectant.
Health authorities assume that the product contains a methanol, a lethal substance, and not a ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the State of New York, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bacterial" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant of the hands and denied it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan from being a "fun talk" and leave disciplinary action at the school district.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no contradictions
The Griffiths are declining talks about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops are in a tight place, but he'll make it turn around.
Hearts fights against the Scotland Football Alliance for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is alert to the January recruitment that could disturb the team's unity.
Dons raised his leadership to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time punishment took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodrien's stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference between Celtic to five points.
Griffiths deciding on contradictions.
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths passed them right away, and he claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under a more accurate eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The lack of the Scottish Championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers' central field player and former Dutch country team leader Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the Championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "The administration no longer shows the highlights of Celtic's games and why?"
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here can't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
These teams have a lot of tensions, and not only the Scottish people want to follow them.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
Lose Malmölle and its resulting drops from the Masters League quickly followed the loss of 10 men to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series with a difference of five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had some bad episodes before, and we'll get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
That's what we are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is being watched for the January Player Transfers
Although Rangers-Pomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible targets of the January players transfers, he's being warned about the recruitment's greatest, making sure he doesn't want to mix the team with the unanimity.
The former boss of Brentford said, "January's transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players coming in the summer, the time of adaptation is all over the time, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in retirement suggests Michu
The attacker in Swansea Michu, whose name was attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swans is terminated.
A 29-year-old player has had an ankle for two years, and during the summer he failed to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scotland Football Alliance for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defendant's red card was revoked later, and this was in the last eight months already the third Collum condemned the red card that was revoked.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernia player was reprimanded after singing an offensive song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at the Roseburn in Edinburg, before Edinburg's derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment of instinct", the attacker said, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
The Tannadice Government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Government still has faith in the leaders' ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakness of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in order," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the "Great Victory" in the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but he managed to achieve his seventh successive league victory, which lifted them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a pocal or a league that would not have won games like this."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the increase in the United Kingdom's total number
THE WORK IN Scotland remained 164 000 in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Britain rose to 1.82 million in the total of 10,000 people.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than 5.5 per cent in Britain, according to the National Statistical Centre (ONS) figures.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people during the three-month period, and the number of employees is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the average of 73.5% in Britain.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of administration is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
It is almost a precise year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has declined.
Why am I witnessing the execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, then today I will see when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit on the watchers' magazine at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've been starting to creep this day as it approaches.
So why did I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through terrifying dignity.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to twelve.
Whoever you choose, you look at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossippi, and I have also made my contact with him through the calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to save what I saw.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma in Twitter accused me of my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner in the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
The affair admitted that "the word could have been better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international reporter who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the direction against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I'm doing.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him guilty anyway.
But I believe that there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I'm sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the angle I look at when he dies.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists here who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it feels like to look at when a man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was dragged out of the Canning River after a water police hunt.
The Canning Valen Officer stayed dry when he dragged a man away from the Canning River River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to deceive the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in a low, muddled water just a few feet from a policeman who tried to "people him back to the beach gently".
Canning Vale's police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of unauthorised intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this was trying to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get too far.
"He stood in the water saying, "I will not come away, come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to be wet, so he used a safer tactic: "Dear police negotiations."
"Something people do funny things while trying to escape," said Sergeant Castledine.
The master's football player Ben Cousins is a impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and trying to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired the locals to begin the design of a playful Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
Peter Moody claims journalists tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria's suppliers tried to infiltrate their treasury in his deposits last year and threatens to stop competition immediately.
He accuses journalists and Racing Victoria's Incorruption Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign to be running against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment of the day of the race was the last stamp.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has suffered a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half of his statements of spy, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and for a long time I've been quiet about it, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that all will be unloaded at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and sleeping well.
I want to go up my head, and I want the owners to think that I will do my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I should no longer be coached.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb at the racing.com site interview where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
Thirteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man and I'm gonna name him when he asked, and they offered him a job on my deposit if he gave me information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, it's true that they should separate their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking it's gonna be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to male and perhaps transfer responsibility to non-trainers about what is happening in the field?
Am I injured in the business?
Am I so uncomfortable?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me away, and I do not doubt that the things that I have said might make them think exactly that.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and I'm sad.
It really hurts me.
I press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with a long-term Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection has led him to say that he could "vise his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the unprofited master Black Caviar, has called the rule on the treatment measures for the race day to be "smart" after the mud or clay hat has been placed in the horse's legs, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to mud it into his leg.
It could have had a hawk last night.
It could have had it last night, just like it was.
It was the day of the race.
Moody may have a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race for the haul treatment, from which the suppliers initiated the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who have these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, arrested by the driver who has been forced to transport
The police have arrested a man who was convicted of traffic escape after hitting a bike in Cobram this weekend.
The bike driver was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by airway after he got serious injuries when the car ran into him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver drove away and didn't stop helping the injured bike.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia registered himself to a police officer in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, negligence of assistance and other traffic violations.
The bike driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
Mr. Melbourne Storm, coach Craig Bellamy, has criticised the arguments of the two NRL-rugbyliga champions that his team's tacklings are part of the line.
Coach of Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson said that the distinguishing judges allowed Storm's "pain" on their side when he suddenly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely going to cover up his reference to Storm after he won North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals.
Bellamy defended his team's tacks and said that they were just focusing on "contact".
Bellamy added that his trust was increased by two leading coach criticisms against Storm, because it means they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This always comes to talk -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2", said Bellamy Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques all year, and in the last six weeks, we've just stressed our contact in the stairs, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes to talk at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "responsive rugby" by reminding her of the mentor of the fact that the St George Illawarra Dragons, who was trained Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "greatly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare Saturday night's game to our Friday night game and tell me how exciting their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said that he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing a rugby we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its kind of players.
He brought out that side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'll be more confident when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as an opposition to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than that played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more paints, but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting breach of the line of defense and not making the goal?
For me, this is about directions.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend, because they have already won the right to a home game against North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night's prefinal at AAMI Park.
$200,000 guarantees for a Serb man for a drug charge.
A man who threatens a life-limit for 40 kilos of cocaine smuggling to Queensland has been released against the guarantee amount of $200 000.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimcovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay Hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu, and shipped into Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the boat harbour all morning, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse café, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens the potential lifetime of a cocaine holding company for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the whole amount and that he could be in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, Judge of the Supreme Court, was concerned that Maxiovic was trying to escape.
"He has solid connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maxiovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a guarantee amount of $200 000 to ensure his exemption.
"After reading the testimony of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of $200 000 is a real economic burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to stop him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he would give up both Australia and Serbia's passports, report to the police every day and hold on to his ban on outdoor movement between evening six and morning six.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to attract pedofils to send pictures.
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of the use of children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then registered to the online communication service where Hogg received a number of unsolicited pictures of the children that another user sent to him.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl studied her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately she told her mother about it.
When the police came to see five photos, investigate the computers on the ground and find "relevant" online searches on searchwords that were used to look for the pictures that were taken from the children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that he had done this "to attract pedofils" on the Internet before he would pretend to be a cop to scare them."
Mr Eilidh Robertson, Mr Fiscal Depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that it was an addiction - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had done his graves on the computer but said they were made only because he wanted to pretend he was a cop so that he could scare the pedofils.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent him the photos, and about the time Hogg asked him to send him some more photos.
Hogg said it was just for bait purposes.
He said that after he drinks, he'd get sick, and he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she screamed to her mother, she shaked and cried.
My mom saw the pictures on the phone and then she met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked like her younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg in Dundee in Ward Road admitted to the accusation of making or taking pictures of unconscious children on 14 June last year. He broke the guarantee on 25 January of this year and refused to come to court on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be recorded in the register of sexual offences because it can be argued that his crime was not a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to allow the social action to have time to produce the background reports.
Hogg was given warranty in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to the sexual criminal records before the day of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has made the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest African leader, Mugabe, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the speaker’s highway.
He wasn't injured, but the video of the fall was spread like a virus in social media.
The Parliament's openings also advocated the opposition legislators' statements that they had been sent with anonymous threats of killing in which they were warned that they would not be bummed to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they busted him and interrupted him with intermediate screams when he held a talk to Parliament about the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democrat Change (MDC) group discipline overseer Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message title is "death"," Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The communication warned the relevant Members that the immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The group disciplinary said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "careful" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year HP is divided into two listed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer business more quickly from growing business equipment and services.
Expected work operations will bring around $2.7 billion costs from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP Communication.
"The restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the president of HP and the CEO, which will lead the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help companies move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it's focusing on producing non-comparative integrated technology solutions for companies, is reported in the Company's Communication.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated from the Stanford University University founded in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in the fire at Alto, called "Piilaakso's birthplace".
HP has undergone a huge reorganization to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology groups in the United States, and its division is the most recent sector based on the belief that firms that are strictly limited are better performing.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates need to support the wounded Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's match.
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire that it is only September and assumed that his rehabilitation will go according to the plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, at least four of the following English games will be missed, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in the European championships next summer.
The biggest pity on this last problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single nasty one, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as well as Wenger admitted, when a player attempts to return to the middle of the road there is always a risk of additional injuries.
The design also has an uncomfortable model.
The studies of the Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since she debütated six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played 157 liiga games of Arsenal in only 65 games.
In view of Arsenal's broader population since 2007-08, for the six years, it has been one of the Valoliiga teams that have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger recognises the possibility of a witch ring, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of their last season will continue to improve in the injuries statistics.
"Sometimes when you get back from the injury can be a risky period when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am sure that will happen, and that he will make a career that he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Masters' League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arte are probably on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give a break to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Even though Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F block, the stadium of Maksimiri in Zagreb is the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign in the last season.
On Tuesday night, Stadion dramatized the earthquake, which was 3,2 Richter's scale.
It was in the tenth Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned to surrender the Championship of the last season against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first victory in the European Cupi.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about the friendship between men
It is spectacular how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates for young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In the recent study, more than 2,000 students from upper secondary schools and high schools showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, the person’s ability to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were "healthful".
Similarly, the probability of developing potential mental health problems for those who were not depressed would be half-life if they were happy to have healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes over content and the immediateity of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though isolation really controls.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not get greater happiness.
The fineness of the Frendie was just that it turned this focus on his head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey's and Chandler's numerous hugs, the moments in nice chairs, I watch football, Ross miss Rachel... these humor came out of the fact that yes, men can match all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans organization explained to me: "When I hear people who are depressed and suicidal, I have truly understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling."
Often, men who contact us feel that they can't talk to friends.
The old thought of getting over is strong, as is the feeling that if you get out of trouble, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that come to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone will help people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a nearby, personal family and friends network.
And so if you're going to participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations will be re-planned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or, what better if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendies will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria's doing the paint and helping PSG hit Malmö's side.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a goal in his Masters' League's Debyyth, helping the PSG to pass the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Under the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Masters League with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions' League in his debyy with a goal of less than four minutes, showing the French League Masters the way, but the team lost several opportunities before they finally increased their way forward when Cavan hit the goal at 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same A-section with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish League Champion, because there was not only a post, but also a cure for their quarterfinal games in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy in the Champions' League to win at home or visitors, so 2-0 wins create problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, even though there are things we have to do this season," Blanc said.
This is gonna be good for you.
We wanted to win and win, even though I regret that we failed to make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team from one of the three changes that took place after the team stayed in the 2-2 game Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine squadron was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran off Marco Verratt's bait behind Malmö's defence line and then hit a beautiful finalization by Johan Wiland on the back corner of the network.
But if someone was expecting the PSG to be easy and big, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent, winning at the Celtic settlement match when getting to this level, its opening room has nine international players and five-man defenses and two players in the deep middle.
But the team didn't offer much more than a 34-minute shot by Nikola Djurdjic, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp's goal.
On the other hand, the PSG was sometimes lost because of the feedings lost and the bad finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the touch of Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing his pre-work to his colleagues, and just from the feed of Ibrahimovic, Di Maria sent on the way a rotation drum, which bended around Wiland's goal base around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally reached after an hour of the game, thanks to the sixth goal of the season, the uruguay Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had pushed forward from the left of Maxwell's cross-eating.
It ended with Malmö's wishes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's direct kick kept the end numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz from the exchange was rejected right at the end of the game.
The Coach Age Hareide of Malmö later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Masters' League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
It was a great game from them.

Matt Damon is declining the difference in filming.
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker, Effie Brown, when they talked about the difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
At the HBO Sunday evening, an actor experienced at the Project Greenlight, interrupted Brown's action while highlighting the need for different perspectives as regards the dark main person of the selected manuscript.
"When we're talking differentials, it's taken into account when choosing actors in the movie, not in the show," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unbelievablely to the injured, the comments "Ooh! Wow. Okay", while the comments from the Martian actress were hanging up.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists in the series.
"I want people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People's producer demanded the rights of directing the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded rudely that their guidance "may end up giving us something we don't want".
When the debate was sent, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger on the film play, writeing: "Matt Damon speaking to the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference to him is NIIN WELL that it hurts."
After its publication, the Twitch collected more than 5000 retweets and 4000 loves.
Damon's comments are at a time when a precise racial presentation in the media is in the interests of social debate.
After the White Police killed a teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter was spread across the country and called on the legislators and authorities to stop the discriminatory practices of coloured people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the sales in the presentation of the Year's album candidates to receive the Grammy Prize.
"Albumes are still meaningful," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to respond to the Fox News TV face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be considered a hostile group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love team," said the leaders.
Recently, Damon was involved in it among the entertainers, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's unclear whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Warrior Master Crowned
The professional climber and the collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday who won the American Ninja Warrior contest and received a $1 million prize.
The competition programme that ended its seventh period has never been a competitor, who would have survived all the obstacles of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and a cameraman, Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last mission was to climb around 23 metres of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, which led him to become the first athlete of all time who solved American Ninja Warrior's exhaustive 4th part, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the difficult profit and was still in shock for winning a million dollars prize.
"That's why it's great to think that when I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
The production director Kent Weed followed to discuss the finalist with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who's managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
Although money is a great prize and changes life, he gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he's angry about it.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers hike Minnesota by Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get a game-party from Houston Astros in the competition from another American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was back for at least one night with the six-wheel H word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All the profits are fun, no matter how they are obtained," said Brad Ausmus, Tigers team leader.
The Tigers feedr Alfredo Simon continued his early assault support when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in shifts and released three runs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the alternate to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tigers substitutions Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit run after the mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three hits after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He twisted the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in impact exercises), seemed considerably better at hit exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the second half of the seventh shift couple, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentren Byron Buxton started a shift by hitting twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks came home with one nest, and Simon got burned straight to the second nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked with Mauer, the only player who was against the first-in-depth, a deputy named Miguel Says, who pulled a two-left run from Drew VerHagen to the left of the right-handed.
When two runners were on the field and a smooth runner on the second nest, VerHagen got a third base on Trevor Plouffe to hit a double painting leading to a double game.
It was a record of the main series: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a security run at the beginning of the ninth, Mauer swinged two hits against the Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in three baits in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used the rusted Phil Hughes at first.
Tigers received three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed veteran player, who got out of the list of injured people before the game after being out of the game for more than a month due to the naked infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but when I went to the game, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I had done a few nice feedings on my third shift."
After Hughes captured the first nest of the launcher, he let the second nest player Ian Kinsler move between one.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the hit shift, which took himself on the middle field to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good runways.
Nick Castellanos, the third-step player, continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned while he tried to move to the third-step.
Tigers continued on the second round and received one fire, two nests run by James McCann and two fires, one nest in the event of a runner in Anthony Goselta, followed by 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said the Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in feed readings and fed the undue third shift pair, and then became his replacement right-handed contributor A.J. Achter.
Hughes got three runs from six hits and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed feeder of Tigers, was thrown away in the shoulder's stretch.
He's investigating Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez into the shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to the shoulder beating, but he had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, the left-handed feeder, Daniel Norris, will be on the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 four initiatives after the left-handed feeder David Price was switched to him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of the bruises of the right abdominal muscle.
The series of three games between Tigers and Twins ends in the Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy more widely for the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth, and President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, which is the task of guiding the reform.
"The China should undertake to attract foreign funding and expertise and to develop transparency policy," she said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as further reforms are driven by new movements and vitalities, as well as creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting access to the market, the degradation of border control principles, the call for private capital to be taken by state-owned companies, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, namely those sectors and companies that must not be invested in.
The system is gradually tested and improved through experimental programmes.
The change is significant as it will play a greater role in the market in the allocation of resources, ensure a legally based business environment and make the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also confuses its governance in the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The opinion also said that China will allow border regions to be able to examine new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open the sectors managed by the government to private donors, more sectors are opening up.
"Government does not change its direction on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better services", said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to exercise of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in the opinion published after the meeting.
