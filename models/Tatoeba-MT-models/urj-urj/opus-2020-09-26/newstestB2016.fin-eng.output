A 9-year-old boy on escape in Tampere found
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance declaration of a son from Western Tamperee with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and there is no danger of life and health.
The son's father told Ilta-Sanom that he was found at midnight.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start examining.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo as a hurricane again... Ripped the goal break to the Messiah.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued its factory in the Masters League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Championship of the Championship of the Champions' League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the painting statistics of all time when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of punishment and one game situation.
Ronaldo lifted his goal balance to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messique, which was read with him, has 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been compiled in the Italian football league in Serie A since early, but in the D-section of the Champions' League, it started in a strong 2-1 visitor win from Manchester City.
The winning painting made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juvenus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-driven Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured at the election game, only came to the field with the last ten minutes.
Another company in Manchester United also experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 deaths.
Luke Shaw's guest match of the 20-year-old law enforcement officer in ManU lasted only 15 hours.
The dangerous sliding stretch of PSV Moreno hit the goal towards the attacked ManU pack so bad that Shaw probably broke his leg bone.
Shaw slept on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff went to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but the joy of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened it before it took a break with an extra time.
The PSV winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
At the Masters' League, the painting season began the A block of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was an Argentinean Angel Di Maria, who changed the pants of Manchester United's shirt to the PSG stunt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball through the back corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
The PSG has been conjected with the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the lengths of the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Starfleet of the PSG, met his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow CsSKA lost 0-1 at the B block match in Germany to Wolfsburg.
The opposition party immediately called for resignation, the president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, held the same speech as he had held a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has kept the same speech in the country's Parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize that speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether Mugabe 91 is in full spirit power.
The Prime Opposition Party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because it's too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's presidency and that the President had not done anything wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want a special summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra EU leaders summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
Mr Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Merkel, fall within the table of the Ministers of Interior.
The professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb at the University called for an emergency call, and I'm a little shaking a cop at his home and told me he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and probably alive and probably scared, and the professor told me that the contacts of the dead woman's family were on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written in hand on Amy Prentiss' body and on the white paper: "I am very sorry and I hope I could reverse my actions. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says Lamb in the letter signed by the authorities.
There was no sign of the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University at Mississippi Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the campus of the school, found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was dead from the campus at the door of his office, believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, stated that the university's authority received information about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
One more death was in place today, and Lamb took his life when the police came after him.
The next day of the Ampoums, students and staff stayed viciously behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers explained details in both places, and the teachers who knew Lamb told us about the man, a picture of a talented but perhaps a problematic teacher was created.
Students always said they were eager to wait for the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier police at the Prentiss Death County, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
Schmidt had, in turn, mentioned in a book written by Lamb, which had given recognition to the “skinned people” with whom he was allowed to spend an academic life with.
Both of them worked at a social science and history institution with 17 staff members. Many students participated in both men's courses.
However, there were indications of the problems.
Brandon Beavers, the student who complimented Lamb, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous as if he had a problem.
The second student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously requested medical leave from Delta State University for some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration policy meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked hard did not automatically guarantee him the assistant professor's office.
Director William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled.
These questions will no longer be answered by Lamb.
After the campus, the police figured out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber gun at the backyard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a mile from his parents' home, Methel Johnson told me.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
The police didn't find out immediately why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson told me that he believed he knew the residents of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started work as a teacher in geographic and educational science at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got his doctoral dignity in education in spring.
One of Lamb's longest friends pictured this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said he met Lamb through his joint friends when he was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar play for years.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker at that time.
All the girls were with him on his bike," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss, apparently, had been dating for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but any document says they have not been married.
A couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river sand in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that she broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was totally upset," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when both Lamb and Abigail appeared at the summer event three years ago.
Later they called together, too.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator in a modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier said he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick to a few audiences.
Nothing said anything about something being wrong.
"Happy couple," said Shaffer.
"We were joking together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who had his death, was guided by first year's seminars and specialized in the history of Indians and colonials," said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied Emporia at State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and university.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered at the Memorial at the candlelight. They included teaching staff, other staff, students and residents in the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the nighttime event where the university's choir played the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi Cleveland.
Assistance journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippin Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police now say that Lamb called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and it was also specified that even though Lamb referred to the emergency call as his wife in Prentiss, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
The Toys R Us company is not going to hire as much seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells its current employees and seasonal workers to offer more hours of work.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people to shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews of the applicants will be launched this month, and new workers will start in the October-December.
Although there are months left in the holiday period, the season in trade is approaching well, and companies are preparing to hire temporary labour for shops and for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film to return to the future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive, and I noticed there was an empty place next to me, and I realized that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me that the Back in Time document was coming in the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document relates to the Return to the Future Films, and the document interviews not only Fox but also Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, but also director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie got her premiere 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me all the time," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD formats and is presented in selected film theatres from October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on the enhanced war effort of Russia and notes that there is no military solution for nearly five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council to unite their strengths and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
During the Wednesday press conference, Ban reported his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the decentralisation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional troops has led to a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, which reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Chapter 8 of the support questions: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trumpia's been tried to stamp into an empty talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
The republican circles have (the twelve) results sought to pull Trump down from the gallup line.
Ten of the eleven national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit endorsement figures, some of which are already considering what it is practically about the potential for the candidates of the propertymogul.
The elections, though, are only in the early stage.
Nowhere has yet been declared that Trump is selected as a Republican candidate.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry, who was in the gallop, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain.
The drum would be difficult for many reasons in the general election.
External groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the economic conservative group for Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and started digging into her landing.
The following recent gallup data show that the property mogul cannot be ignored by beer adjustment:
There's been a full translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced to be a candidate in the mid-June, according to the Monmouth University gallup, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of the property mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive picture.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now six of the ten Republicans are a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten, the picture is negative.
These figures are also considered in the state where the elections are held first.
In the last week's Quinn Market Gallup, 60% of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidate.
In CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67% of the Republicans said they were very pleased or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump as candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidate.
Ben Carson will achieve almost as enthusiastic reception as Trump (43 per cent would be very pleased with Carson's candidateship and 40 per cent Trump's candidate).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding contribution of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were to be elected candidate for the party.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is problematic.
Donald Trumpia has been highly criticised for potential and insulting comments. 52% of the Republicans' supporters all over the country consider the properties of the property mogul to be suitable for the President.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the first party meeting is held: according to the Quinn Market Gaul, 52% of the Republicans consider Trump's personal features to be suitable for the commander of the Defence Forces.
According to ABC and Post, however, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate to the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be the candidate of the party, according to CNN and ORC's gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since the mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money in trouble for Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have previously not had a very reliable crystal ball.
At this stage in the last elections, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a probable candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to consider Trump's campaign convincing.
Although the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Some experts consider that the divided camp is likely to benefit from Trum, when Trumpi's opponents are divided into the supporters of the various candidates.
At the beginning of September, the Monmouth University survey revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican candidate in a fictional double fight Trump would almost always have a larger support team.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bushia with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichia and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a win from Trump 19 points apart in a fictional double fight.
A short majority of Trump's supporters already say that they have taken a vote decision.
According to the gallupe published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, the fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at present a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trumpin this moment is a very competitor of the neurokirurg Ben Carson, but the voters who have already elected their candidates will vote twice as likely as Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of migration.
In his campaign call from Donald Trump two months ago, migrants from Mexico were rapists who had been a hot subject for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's mighty speeches are expelling important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and hindering the brand's reform.
However, according to the results of the ABC News and Washington Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as the colony is in the light, it is also Donald Trump.
Unsatisfactory to administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently gathering around half of the Republicans' votes. The popularity adds substantially to the fact that both have come outside of the condition.
In the Republican troops, instead of a political concar, a fresh face is desired to be a candidate. According to the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, this was the opinion of the Republicans from six to ten.
These two candidates are also mad at Washington.
According to the opinion survey made by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have frustrated the Republicans in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% are on the edge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Corbyn's first presentation at the Prime Minister's Question Time is excited.
Jeremy Corbyn's new workshop of the Labour Party's collar is scheduled to rise up for the first time in David Cameron's exploratory class later.
Corby's first six questions after a little after midnight, the media and the representatives of the Labour Party are following the man's eye hard.
Corby's been calling for less theater and adding the fact to a weekly show.
He has also found that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
During the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed at the first time in connection with the parliamentary test, and now Corbyn will be subject to the meeting of the shadow government and Corbyn's Central Organisation for Trade at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday after his speech.
The decision of the Labour Party's collapsing decision to silence the 75th anniversary of the UK Air War during the national song has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party. The debate has also ended on the titles of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national song attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative said Corbyn’s stand during the national song, with quiet respect for the heroism of the King’s Air Forces in the battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, the shadow government member of Corbyn, in the Two's Newsnight programme, told the BBC that he would have called the leader of the party to join the national song despite the opposition to this monarchy.
The ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first-level teams, insisting on disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and less than sixth of the parties initially supported the choice of Corbyn to the party leadership.
The correspondent of BBC's policy Robin Brant believes that political disagreements on the conditions for membership of the UK and the granting of the government's constraints have accumulated in the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that the workforce intends to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
Hours later, Minister for Work and Retirement, Smith, said that the party's position is very clear: it opposes only the government's plans to lower the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth working leader David Cameron in the last decade under the Tory Party.
The new approach to policy is said by the Labour Director that he has chosen the questions to be raised to Cameron from the 30 000 proposals received by the public.
According to Corbyn, Mr Islington's electoral district, there are too many summits in the Question Time, and he promises that he will avoid clever words and loan throws and will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow minister Angela Eagle will hire him in the poll class, for example, when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Corby has also threw out the idea that others may sometimes be able to get to the vote, and he will tell us that he has discussed this with John Bercow, the President of the House's sub-room.
After Corbyn got to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a doll theater policy, often linked to a questionnaire hour, but some years later he admitted that he failed in his efforts.
Since the first time the Question Time was television in 1990, it has been considered a key measure of the director's criticism, subroom management and position, but according to the criticisms, the survey has become a caricature that needs massive reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young people as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
The group of former street children has found a meaningful way to learn and make money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit chart where homeless young people are taught to photograph their home and deserve at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has been completed through the project among the first.

Pound increases in UK wages
The pound was reinforced when wages were raised in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index.
In May-July, wages increased by 2.9 per cent in Britain compared to the corresponding period of last year.
The faster growth predicted was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was increased by 1 per cent and its rate was quoted at USD 1,5505. The pound also increased in proportion to the euro and was quoted to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The highest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was down by 20% when the company received an initial offer from AB InBev.
When it takes place, it would combine the world's two largest brewery companies and bring the same roof under brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the positive results of the competing Richemont Group focusing on luxury products in old water.
The latest sales figures in Richemont are better than predicted, and the development of sales was also about the rises in Burberry's key markets in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent of the mining waste's intentions to collect $2.5 billion in share as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packing and paper group Mondi were the largest drop in the fall of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
JD Sports rate rose by 3.1 per cent after the company informed that its return before taxes will rise by 83 per cent to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports Boss: greater wage expenses could be damaging enlargement
According to Mr Cowgill, the president of the JD Sports management group, the minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs can jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash lanseera against the grass root campaign against Ald’s spice
Metcash is seeking to secure its IGA store from Ald's throne in South and West Australia.
Metcash's wholesaler has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the IGA market share in South and West Australia against Ald's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand on the market in mainstream communications and social media and organise events such as Adelaide-show.
IGA stores and suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, in Dunsborough, Simmo offers tastes in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to stockers at the discount price for the South Australian football league.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade is organised by the annual investment strategy date.
This is a major market because South and West Australia represents almost 30% of the footprint of the IGA stores in Metcash, and in these areas, the production of catalysts is higher than the IGA network of eastern states.
Southern and Western Australian consumers are known for their cornerstone, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in Western Australia is 24%, while in eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can sell 360 million and Metcash at the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in these regions.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million in the result of interest and taxes, Kierath states.
At the same time, Metcast loses its market share in eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent research suggests that IGA's clients are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the managerial portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, told me that in the event held in Melbourne, Metcash would be very likely to disappear within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public opinion on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcashi Government contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and Metcash’s food business for 1200 IGA resellers has decreased by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes over $150 million of Australian dollars in order to respond to Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the modernisation of shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the supply of food for its own brands.
According to Ian Morrice, Metcash’s CEO, price review and business reform plans are in good speed, and the company is able to raise its profits for the first time in 2017 to four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Alliance, defends Thanas from Kokkinak
The Thanas Kokkinakis deserves to behave rather than criticism.
According to the Australian Tennis Union president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a sideline victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related jupaka, which deserves a special title instead of criticism.
The youngest party named "Special K", Kokkinakis, became unfavourable, when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in Montreal's ATP tournament.
Soon after this, in the fight between Cincinnat and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinka should have given back to the Cyrgios and me," Harrison said.
In the U.S. open, Kokkinakis frustrated the field when the strong cramps ruined his fight, and Healy has faithfully defended him against the cooking.
At the moment, the teenager star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the two-single game behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against the Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanas has been dragged along with his dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the fight in the US open, and he's not the first player to break his country for frustration, and I know Thanas so well that he's not proud of what he's doing.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the U.S. open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a glorious operation around him, and I think he's just been treated somewhat unfairly.
He is very mature when he is 19 years old, he works hard and complements a well team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He exercises hard, is in good condition and is really stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop the Cyrgios Australia team from an important round starting on Friday, and Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties, but he supports the return of the Canberra breeder for a long-term confirmation of the team.
Firstly, we want to concentrate fully on the matches instead of the poles associated with the Cyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly, and, among other things, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the light of the public. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency situation, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary, who declared the emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia's direction on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants.
The border came from chaos when hundreds of migrants accumulated into a non-one country, and Serbian authorities react ragefully.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the roadside between national inspection stations for an indefinite period of time in their tents
It started to get on the surface.
As the police helicopter flies in the air above the migrants, these sneaked "Open the border!" and screamed insults to Hungarian riot police.
Some of them started to protest for eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it did not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Death on the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when the 28 national groups failed to develop a common immigration policy in Brussels at a controversial meeting.
However, the Ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flood of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was common, and the meeting was of the desire to reach agreement on what EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary, in the next month or at the end of the year.
On Tuesday, the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria invited a special summit for the next week to discuss the continental immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to use more effective means, i.e. to close you and to speed up the legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, stated that Hungary is also planning a pitch wire aid on the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migration from that direction, now that there is already a ready aid on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even the prisoners participated in the invitation to tender for the finalisation of Hungarian-Serbia pitch wire bars.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for immigrants to the European Union, and many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people who arrive in the area of life are refugees, not war criminals who have the right to seek security, but that the views of other EU countries, including Germany, are steeply different.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime that exceeds or damages four metres of high-speed bars which have been built by the government on the southern border in Serbia, which also defines longer periods of imprisonment for human traffickers convicted.
Because of the situation caused by mass change, the government declares the state of crisis, the Government reporter Zoltan Kovacs told the journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We follow a tight line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept military action that is expected next week. The journalists of the Associated Press News Office on the border have for several days seen severely armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Inland security adviser of Orban, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities have captured 45 cross-border attempts to cross the border immediately and 15 miles away.
Helping people who have crossed the border, they're now in possession of the police, and they're being accused of crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities are quick to fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two border crossing points on seven Serbian borders on Tuesday, a single crossing point was closed by means of a train wagon covered by the silk wire.
Chaos took the main border crossing position near Rosche in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container at the point of business where people were packed in.
About 20 were fit in, but thousands of them were out.
The second group of immigrants blocked the main street, which combines Serbia and Hungary, and people reported themselves to be in a snack and drink strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's management in relation to Bernie Sanders by national gallup
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton's support is still in a two-digit race as a national candidate for the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the distance.
Clinton's support is now 47% of the votes of democrats (increase of 58%), while Sanders' second position is 27% (increase of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the Presidential Championship, with 15% of his support among the democrats.
More than five months before the pre-elections for most of the democrats it is too early to tell who they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice.
Clinton has lost the support of several groups of democratic groups since last month's gallup with CBS News, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership is narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen considerably, and he has only a 5% bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost its leadership among the under 50-year-old democrats, and now he is even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
In the last month, Clinton's front trip to the Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-digit neck to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the democrats will be happy to report their support to Clinton if he is selected as candidate for the party.
Fourth would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was selected as candidate.
There is more dispersion among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
48% of the democratic voters would support Clinton, but only 35% of the Republican voters would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trum.
When Clinton voters are free to describe why they are in favour of his candidate, the most popular justification is the correct experience of Clinton (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President still pounds his potential candidateship, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to go along with the race, and the third would rather leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidates are enquired from the democratic voters as a candidate of the party, most will choose Biden.
Clinton's supporters over half of Biden, after Clinton, are the second most popular candidate and much more popular in Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the DRC, Hillary Clinton will increase his way forward to Sanders.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton a candidate with the best chance to win the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
The second Biden is far from Clinton, but more believes in Biden's chances to win the actual elections.
However, the Democrat voters consider the views of candidates more important on the issues.
The voters do not view any candidates of democracy or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia are honest, reliable and leaders.
Biden is mostly described as being honest, while Clinton is most considered to be the leader type.
Up to 30% of the democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, by 15% of Sanders. 27% do not know whether Sanders are honest.
The Democrats believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideals of the voters.
With regard to all the features, about a quarter, there is no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private email and its own server as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the majority of the voters say they are pleased with Clinton's explanation and has not changed the opinion of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with the Clinton report, and only one third is satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just emerged.
Most Americans believe that the use of the controversial e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
The majority of this 36%, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While the voters in their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these features when all voters are asked: Clinton is only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not consider Trum to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good grades of leadership.
Six of the candidates involved in the surveys Biden, Carson and Bushi were considered to be the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have a Sanders opinion.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters and the questionnaire error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson closes Donald Trump's way forward in the national question of support
According to the latest CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates had more than half of the votes in the new questionnaire and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support, which has risen before the debate made by Fox News last month on 23% of the CBS survey. According to the Tuesday survey, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson’s support would in the same period lead to a huge increase, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has a strong support for all population groups, and in a group of high-skilled people, he wins Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich, remain far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2%.
Former governor Jeb Bush in Florida, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and senator Marco Rubio in Florida shared their third position with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 republican voters is 6 per cent in the direction or direction, which was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published by CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, and it is worth 19% of the Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
Also, in the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly in charge of Carson.
In the last week's meeting of men, Trump was charged with the neurological surgeon retired, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members in charge of the death of the Baruch College Fux
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the department's ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people are counted as murder charges.
The members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Ps Division were harshly assaulted by the Baptists of Chu's "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to officials, the victim's eyes were tied, his back was put on a bag filled with almost 15 kilograms of sand and had been repeatedly attacked when he tried to reach an object placed on the other side of the ice field.
First, Deng is told that he felt a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps department didn't call an emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they're supposed to have waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
In the press conference, police officer Chris Wabner told us that the members were able to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact the section's president Andy Meng.
At this stage, Members began to hide the instruments, putting the department's interests ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng wasn't recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng had been hit in the head, the upper body and the thigh with a boring object.
"There have been too many families that have been shocked by the division's slice, because at least one student has died as a result of the slice of the slice since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family-represented lawyer.
The departments and their members must be responsible for taking an important step by the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County filed five members of the department to be charged with the third-grade murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be accused of smuggling and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the formal or informally accepted organization of the simulation," Wagner told us at the press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College set up a ban on the operation of the department, and the national department dismissed the operation of the local department.
This will affect the increase in interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fedin)
The increase in interest rates and the increase in the stock market period are depleted, the return on securities is rising and the economy slips into a downturn.
We know that.
However, we do not know how long everyone will take and how long it will last.
In particular, with regard to the economy, we will find a reference in the history of timing.
The recession has arrived in up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively increases interest rates, not always.
Therefore, the officials of the central bank have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to when the increase in interest rates begins but how long it will take to normalise the situation.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators can note that any increase in interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first lift of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, the Chief Global Economist of Capital Economics told his clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a fairly low level. It is a scary stand for many of the shocks.
However, this does not mean that there is no effect.
Examples based on historical trends of how the impact can be reflected in the various sectors of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the increase in interest rates can increase instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the recession of capital gains after the first increase to 12 to 24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank analyst found the recent increase in interest rates in the study.
As specified over the 35-year period, a sharp increase is generally seen in the market at the time of the increase in interest rates, approximately 14%, relatively steady for the next 250 days (mean increase 2.6%), after 500 days, the situation is normalised, and the average interest income after six stocks is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main equity strategy in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsch, the impact on shares is generally increased at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income is beginning to decrease.
The situation is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank encounters the circumstances that were not previously in existence and could accelerate the decline rate.
Particular attention is given to the fact that GDP is at the lowest ever in the light of the increase in the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been less than 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015, shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine to last, and in the third quarter there is 1.5 per cent, Atlanta’s regional central bank reports.
In this sensitive economic situation, the increase in interest rates may pose a risk and may be asked if this situation was different, said Deutsche.
On the market, operators have been talking about the increase in the interest rate throughout the year, and the views will therefore turn to the Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategics and economists believe that even though the open market committee would approve the increase at this meeting, the fusion trade would only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lift cycles to this day have been supercyclical, which is also a very rapid rise in GDP before the fall rate", says the report.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession of the comparative period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has waited for since the last recession. It had been 35 months, now it's going 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been instability in the past of interest rates, and the formula also recurs on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of mass bonds, the return appears to be changing immediately when the first up-to-down cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, outputs will immediately fall," said Deutsche.
The strategicists of Charles Schwab believe that the interest rate will bring the long- and short-term bonds closer to each other and improve the curve.
"The high-income bonds often work better in this environment, even though we are still cautious about profits," said Schwab's analyst of fixed-income securities, Kathy Jones.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already many signs of alignment with financial policy," Jones says.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the rate of return is direct, the credit risk margins have expanded and the volatility has increased, and all are market-like in a situation where the central bank tightens policy.
In broad terms, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit from a fall in interest rates and local products start to attract.
The prospects of debted multinational companies are weaker, as the strong dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the debt is rising.
"The historian shows that quality shares are more profitable over the next three months of interest rate increases," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets won a weak balance sheet after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also managed better than quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively.
"Welka is a big question.
Businesses with a significant share of the debt of variable interest rates lose most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually benefit from a dollar increase.
Savings also benefit from higher profits, although experts disagree with the speed of impacts.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for over popularisation.
According to Bingham, today it is difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
The BBC Music Awards also claimed to be a copy of the British gala.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Damien Collins is accusing the Voice channel of personality.
According to the significant parliamentary, BBC Radio 3 is gradually transformed into a copy of the Classic FM channel.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the radio channel of the broadcaster is becoming too popular and that the channel is no longer much different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards Classic FM," said Bingham.
The BBC Music Awards award gala will also receive criticism from Bingham in December:
"The first BBC Music Awards organised last year seems to be a copy of the British Award gala.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of a new one and a different one, we will only imitate what is already on the market," says Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC forbided the accusations and stated that there was much more commercial competitors in providing BBC Radio 3 with live music and enlightening content.
"Radio 3: I learned from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel commitment to live music and making music is of its own category.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," the Director-General said.
Earlier this year, Director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey said that the position must work harder to maintain the public interest, because the British know classical music more and more.
Radio 3, however, is not the only tough criticism of the entry into the area of commercial channels in the consultation of the BBC, the Committee on Cultural, Media and Sports.
The Tory Parliamentary, Damien Collins, criticised the The Voice Capacity Search Competition that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at GBP 22 million.
"The program is not very debated, because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the programme presented by the BBC1, the star judges of which are brilliant Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to find a hit program in his own garage, the next time it sets up a new show of entertainment.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the ordering of the The Voice series or the use of taxpayers' money for other entertainment formats.
Online trade growth in the slowest of all time in August – the cause of perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by 7 per cent.
The sales of net sales have been statistically recorded since 2000. Last month's growth was the slowest of all time.
The online trade was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can control the shopping desires.
Over ten years, the overwhelming e-commerce has devastated many of the British shopping stunts.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is on a level playing field, and new sales figures show only 7% increase over the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the whole period when the net sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online trade grew by only 5 per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is on a level playing field, and new sales figures show only 7% increase over the first three months of 2015.
"If last year's growth is compared to the 2000s, it is clear that growth will be balanced over time," told Andy Mulcahy, editor of IRG, Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade was accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile purchases.
"There was an increasing number of people who were able to buy from the network, and it was possible to buy many people in a different environment, even if they were at home.
When mobile buying is now more moderate, growth can be balanced."
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered as one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the thematic day to be spent last Friday in November may lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online purchasers compared to normal, caused a number of traders' websites to fall.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers push after the offers, can control their shopping desires in other times.
According to the study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five quid was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of shopped fashion shops.
In the mechanic, the victims of lifting accidents, the family of Bin Laden, are buried in responsibility.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large construction company Saudi Binlad's Group is responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the lift fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered together to bury 29 victims of the fallen crane of Mekka's Great Mosque.
The streets had gathered a bunch of white-dressed people to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The Surustue traveled on a pilgrimage where the crashed building was only a day earlier intruded through the mosque roof onto the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia calls on Bin Laden's family company to be responsible for an accident in which 394 people were injured.
The bodies of the 29 victims who died in a lifting accident were transported on the streets of Mekka’s Great Mosque.
Qasim Akram, from Bolton of the Great Manchester, was among the dead, who had traveled to Mecca with his first sanctuary.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents who were about to start their annual hairy holiday trip.
The authorities of Saudi Arabia have promised that the Hajj saints will be carried out when thousands of people are currently entering the city for the sanctuary.
King Salman said that the Binlad Group shouldn't have left the crawl up when the crawl was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binlad Group is involved in the accident.
However, according to the English communication, the company’s management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Previously on this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are headed for the Hair-Spy movement of the Great Mosque later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice of an accident and no representatives of the group have been requested for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety rules and cooperated with meteorology experts.
Ten cranes are surrounded by Mekka's Big Mosque as part of the giant building project of Binlad's Group.
Bin Laden's family has been close to the Saudi Arab ruler family for decades, and Bin Laden is responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaida's deceased leader Osama bin Laden was a renowned boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
In a heavy rain and in a wind, no lifting occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage of Meka, a duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital treatment.
The authorities ordered a million rials (approximately EUR 250 000) to be paid to victims of victims who were and who were permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, the phenomenon behind the phenomenon is a cheap Eastern European labour force
The British hire more and more generals in the home, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by workers who come from Eastern Europe, who work as professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers are opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, head correspondent, Daily Mail
British are told to move home hammer and painting work to those who come from Eastern Europe.
Hammer and painting skills seem to be scarce today.
Nowadays, the British are increasingly hiring home generals to carry out home scourge work, reports the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns a house repair equipment store chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is based on skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for business operators. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more women's labour force for B&Q stores, because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, there is a need to take into account the demographic trends, as more and more women living alone nowadays are rehabilitating their homes.
"The staff of our sales are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are in the back of the British FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganized the company's management group so that the male and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher’s half-year business profits and sales figures are declining, even though the company worked hardly after closing the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The government of the three Aces decided to rely on forced legislation to save the country's economy.
Even though the effects were very rapid, they were very rapidly affected.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other employees' centre organisations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the broad expression of workers.
A little bit of a lot of people think that's a reason.
Let's see if it's worth breaking when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been on the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, they are going to work.
In old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declaring a wealthy would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people in millions of trade organizations does not take much moments, but it gives us the reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union is no longer so obvious as 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the objectives of the movement, the values have changed
From an interesting point of view of the activity of Ay, the government's brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
As things have appeared to be rolling over the years with their own weight, the unions are finally able to reach the issue, namely the rights of the worker to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary.
Let's do whatever it takes to do with the organizations, so it's silly that the phenomenon of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has already decreased for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's heads.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranna: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduced staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranna starts with the aim of savings, with a total of 8.5 million euros to reduce costs.
As a part of savings, the university will start joint consultations on the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this is about 130 reductions.
Other activities are also intended to save two million.
The Single Negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which is expected to have a deficit of 8.5 million.
This will also be influenced by the government's appropriations operations.
In this financial year, the university will produce about 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly for the next year, but the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The overall budget of the University is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The co-efficient of the reduction of major education and research operations and corporate funding to our university is extremely important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's newsletter.
Before summer, the effects of surgery seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new scales.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last the six weeks laid down by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, says Souter.
Rail transport is expected to be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is the subsidy of the capital region in 2017-2018.
Long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus's plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport from other international companies, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
Time of the interest rate decision for the United States Central Bank
The whole world will follow the US Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on the possible increase in interest for the first time to almost a decade.
The fair half of the economists, which still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest, now assume that the central bank will maintain the interest rate in the current 0-0.25%, as shown by the 80 economic scientists of Reuters.
"This is a historical situation, because the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero level and thus initiate the normalisation of interest rates," said the Peterson Institute for International Economics' senior researcher, Angel Ubide.
The US economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billion additional dollars to the balance sheet and has only accelerated little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation that is not equally rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for a change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is to be published on Thursday, 20 a.m. in Central Europe.
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before a colleague was shot later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped to be able to withdraw it, the authorities told on Tuesday.
At Mississippi Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and he told me he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night", Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a nice dog in the house that has no trouble for anyone but is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell you any motive to shoot.
The police arrived at the scene of action and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and by Lamb, which read as follows: "I am very sorry and I wish I could reverse my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles away to Delta State University, where he killed his history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took his life late Monday when the police reached him.
Director William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb was expected to believe that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities reported on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of triangle drama.
For seven years with Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, who was married, characterized his former wife as a good person.
The couple had resigned 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told us that Prentiss worked online from home to home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lambin Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the woods and took a life.
According to the University website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Falling Stars
Last years have been heavy for an actor (i.e. on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actress has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possessions.
Everything that happened has really demanded its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on page months for two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Championship game against PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant will have to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal will still be hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV Defense Area in the bad fight of Héctor Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or over tomorrow for surgery.
At the age of 18, a young man associated with Manchester United's lines has experienced hard experience and is now injured after great gambling.
They gave Shaw some oxygen in the dressing copy.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two places, he's on the side for six months and he's not playing at the block stage anymore.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno had little effect on it when the red card was not being followed by a penalty strike.
Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can conclude yourself, but I think the situation was worth a break and a red card.
It was a two-foot unacceptable strike."
Shaw's TV is like, "Thanks for all your messages. I can't tell you how upset I am. My recovery begins here and I'm getting stronger."
Add to the topic: Manchester Unitedin Luke Shaw at the PSV match
An English defender has a particular reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"There is a very bad injuries", said the coach of PSV.
"In such a situation of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The purpose of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs playing in the Mexican lines in the Netherlands of Van Gaal only during the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very sorry, because he was not meant to harm the opponent. It's a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw a ball going in another direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's stabbing."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"It feels really bad, I'm really sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, each parent notices that the child will learn his favorite book almost outside.
Except you can see David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teacher story of Dr. Seussi, published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I would love to read it to my children because there is always a picture or a message that we have not seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron is meant to describe the book's story is a summary of the 2012 film version that added new figures and details to supplement the short initial text.
"In the town of Tarville, where the true trees and plants have been lost and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to get to the heart of her dreams by carrying out this greatest dream: see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted had no object of love.
Unless this is enough doubtful, Cameron's text is partly aligned with the Lorax film description on the Internet Movie Database website. It begins as follows: "In the town of Torville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into the heart of a girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book's plan would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and produces them in spite of the opposition to Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, fancy creature that protects forests.
It is likely that such a small pr mission, meaning, is believed as an assistant, apparently for someone who has not read Lorax 20 times as a child.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the text is probably from the Cameron Electoral Office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still tough.
The meeting of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team selected for the UK tour, the recurrence of the loss of the last 3-0 test series is not expected.
I wouldn't shut down the odd chance.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a team three years ago, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experience in 2012, only young positive.
As a ballistic player, Moeen Ali develops as a circular feeder, and Adil Rashid, even though he has no test experience, represents the option of attack.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the British Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to leave Adam Lyth away is difficult for me to understand his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been in two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticised according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best electors.
A few 50-point matches would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits the Yorkshire more runs.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he couldn't do as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long the test hits will be given the opportunity to impress it is difficult.
Lyth received seven paintings — like his predecessor, Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and visiting games.
The only subject of complaining may be that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in the top condition — but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team, and he's the hitter I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
Without the idea that Moeen will start a beating shift with Cook, which will bring an extra spinner into the game while holding four quick-speakers, and I am not against the idea.
I can't see an obstacle to the fact that the high-speed player could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have had much time in his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a team third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Tests as the first replacement player before getting started in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as an alternate circumference, and based on what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistical figures — on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a feeder — and this can be a search shooter, but a lot of circulating users have not shown themselves ready, and the electorates decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this battle trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few intelligent choices in his training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's hitter, Mchain Jayawardenene, as a Consultant for Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most sweet men in the species who bring a lot of experience because he has played against all kinds of attacks and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball of the gambling trip, including energy and mercy.
I think that he has always influenced the appropriate international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, it may be a spray injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's matches, Root got the same chance against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not set the timetable.
And it must be remembered that, like players, their jobs also depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
The Brexit camp can win if the economy is bad at the time of 2017
David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for staying in Britain in the EU is increasingly deep every day, even without the "yes or no" choice of a pleased Jeremy in Corbynia in the head of the Labour Party or the TUC to make a lot of laughs about Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
Recently, the European diplomat explained how many crises the EU is crying – although not all are doing its own actions – some of the Member States are tired of the UK's self-evident agenda, which includes disagreements and harmful changes to the Treaty which they do not even want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of TUC decided that they would not enjoy the EU if it was aggravating social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Federal Chancellor are hanging out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the main cities of different countries, catching a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-quality persons, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-looking UK inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says and proposes that a growing number of short-looking ministers and officials in different capital cities have come to the point that no longer care whether we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's discretionary alliance Chancellor is an alliance, but he has been in power for ten years and he wants to leave the office before it deteriorates, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is facing a re-election or the choice of successor in 2017.
His power's falling down too.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right government, and in Spain, the Left Government.
It is difficult to imagine them running around to help selfie brits that could use their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it because most of them have separatist pumps.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately make useless comments to the Scottish National Party's style in the UK National Choice campaign 2017, which wants to push Brexit's process, my friend proposes.
"The latest negotiations were a case," "the United Kingdom had nothing left in the hands of the latest negotiation."
The Europeans know how the British press catches and how the EU-Skeptic oligar magazine is, just like Tony Ben's 1975 referendum, which was the result of 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone is remotely remembering Boris Johnson, a vicious European opportunist, who became known as our "EU direct banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early '90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax circumvention, phone hacks and seemingly-model suits that own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same way about them, but then he realized that when he was in a cage with a rough gorilla, he must spread bananas to a blur so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was also the blairest in opposing the referendum, and Blair granted the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the Treaty at the referendum in 2005, Blair was handful of getting away.
The press never forgived him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me on the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he had no time to waste any more time on me, and it could be a risk that he would put in place Neil Kinnock's mediaboiquet strategy in the '80s.
It may be time, but Corbyn has to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who he was sitting on the BBC suite on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call construction.
He says he wants to keep us in the reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to be able to respond to this in agreement.
That's what Hilary Benn, but not Bennit, said this week on radio and television when his internal patrol boy tried not to give up that Corbyn was a bad bet to call the karski John McDonnell as the shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 70th century, when his old father had trouble on television being unloyal to his colleagues of the Labour Party without going too far and losing his place in the subroom.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to the EU's residency in all circumstances. McDonnel did not say so, nor did Corby's colleagues and subroom members in private meetings on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to care about how wonderful the picture he even touched me. The constituent is important during the 24/7 period, especially in the social media discipline where paranoia and fraud are linked.
Mr Cameron does not need to be given a free passport for the EU, in which he could view the support of the workforce as self-evident in the referendum, as Mr Donnell has said.
Simon Jenkins thinks that.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivocation of membership of the EU is compatible with the Bennite architectural economy and the anti-capitalism past, and the discussions are no longer just a small range of left-wing dissidents to whom the idea of a combination of similarity is a key lesson in the doctrinal twins.
The Equivocation has also been seen for NATO, and Tom Watson is unsettled by the fact that Corby is not campaigning for his departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters, why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States has already quite disappointed in the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory Government, and I received a reminder on Monday in the context of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticised the British authorities' opinions on electricity cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by the State-funded institution that the burning of electricity cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born in a meeting with 12 participants having connections with the tobacco industry.
The experts criticised the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on electricity cigarettes.
PHE described the report published last month as a "reversible and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the security of the data and raised the links between certain experts in the tobacco industry.
Last month, the headline of the Lancet Medical Journal took the teeth into the "heated base", on which the main conclusion of PHE is based.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were set up on "call or sand".
European public health professor Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell have stated: "The basic presumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that the PHE's claim that "the best estimate is that electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the research results.
The argument is drawn from a 12 meeting that was convened for the development of a model based on a multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA, which was intended to harmonise the views of the participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, supporters included, among other things, EuroSwiss Health, which has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources, by the CEO.
In addition, the Executive Director demonstrated its support in the Sustainable Action Report for the public health performance of the BAT.
One of the 12 participants granted funding from the electric acid manufacturer. However, the alleged funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by the relevant participant.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria of the panel, but there are several well-known supporters of cigarettes, some of which share as a funder for industry.
However, some of the participants do not know their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE’s tobacco responder.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no unquestionable evidence of the harmfulness of the products in relation to the wide range of products and their compliance with their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has been no evidence that electricity cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of PHE's health and well-being has previously responded to the claims.
According to Fenton, electricity cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every one of the people who smoke through life dies because of the dependence on tobacco.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electricity cigarettes are lower than the risk of traditional tobacco, but long-term effects must be further examined.
PHE is obliged to inform the citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not indicate, in particular in a situation where relative hazards compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
The United Kingdom has nearly 80 000 deaths associated with smoking each year, and smoking costs 2 billion GBP per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the present evidence that electricity cigarettes are not a riskless alternative, but that they are part of the damage to traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up the EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, who was in charge of Channel 4, has said that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand on the hitchairs, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licensing fee should only be used for the production of programmes that are not performed by other television stations.
He criticises the presentation of programmes that are likely to be achieved by a smaller audience with the large audience programmes of competitors and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
When the BBC Director Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for a period of six years he had attempted to cooperate with the BBC.
"I do not agree with the idea of BBC buying formats and sending programmes that would clearly belong to some competing channel software," Johnson told the Committee on Communications of the House, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wishes to hold a radio charge, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply at least by programmes which are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time, because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If any other channel doesn't take care of the program, it's clearly a ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without aid," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders second, even though it is own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand on it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be loss for BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010. He believes that BBC will hug good audiences because the company is working for ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the most popular series of BBC are in the same direction as the former Sky Bounty Tony Ballin, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC would sell out series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the programs for the BBC's niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the number of audiences cannot be measured most often, but the programs fulfil their purpose. "BBBC can say, in defending its hypocrisy, that they had made special programmes that no one saw."
"BBBC plays them in times where no one ever sees them."
From the broadcast charges, Johnson said, "I'm calling for you to find another equally old-fashioned system in that sense, who gets the best.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year are cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if they don't exactly look at BBC."
Former Head of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also stated his own views in the committee on Tuesday, stated that BBC should exchange its ancient mission to the new "information, teaching and entertaining".
According to Elstein, BBC's current offer is hardly equipped with educational programmes – 1 per cent in television and radio – adds that BBC should learn from Australia's and Canada's broadcasters and bend his mission to the new faith: "inform, illuminate and entertain".
In the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that BBC be able to increase transmissions such as events, such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were sent only a fraction last year. "BBBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to ensure that the whole supply is also available online", he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle switches in its direction when the ultrasound is targeted.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nerve system, so we can control worms with ultrasound.
Small shuttles change their direction when targeting ultrasounds with a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Add the subject: Researchers are following the brain activity through light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). The method uses ultrasound to activation of brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritation from outside the body.
The Salk Instute Investigator in California, Sreekanth Chalasani, told Guardian that one day, the method can replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method for treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The sledges usually do not respond to the ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that the worms are starting to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles increase ultrasound waves that move into worms.
Strengthened ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ionic ports, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to the article published in the Natural Communications magazine, the sound waves will enable these ion channels to open and activate cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttle mats with ultrasound, Chalasani transformed worms genetically so that I was able to develop TRP4 ion channels from their movement-controlled nerves.
When ultrasound was controlled to convert to mats, the microscopes confirmed waves and moved to mats, when the nerve cell moved a signal.
The method is a little similar to an optogenetic tool that makes researchers able to activate nerve cells by means of light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics have certain benefits compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains under investigation by means of light fibers, and the low frequency ultrasounds easily pass through the cell, so the ultrasound can be driven through the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic therapy and virus treatment can allow human nerve cells to be exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurologic treatments," Chalasani stated.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture tools — your doorstep!
Advertisements are ashamed of the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arm show video.
Horrifying killer missiles!
Crickets breaking leg irons!
Grape bombs!
Distance deflectors that cause unbearable pain but do not leave traces!
The joyous voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a parody. Video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to raise the British government's attempt to sell weapons to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) Fairs in the ExCel Fair Centre in London.
More about: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian governments arrive in London
Bus stops and metrocars also have posters that require a second look.
"Recommended: Are you moving on the metro between 15 and 18?" The announcement reminds me of the appearance of the London metro declarations. There is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the metro line.
"In September, a bunch of arms dealers arrive at Docklands, and the customers are asked to help stop the gun fairs."
Three hundred posters have made artists who were present at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
The Collective, called Special Patrol Group, helped distribute posters around London with a six-pound "mainstitute hacker package" with six-block keys that claim to be available to around a third of the world's bus stop advertising posters.
Transport for London is not laughing at posters' vandalism.
One of the Special Patrol Group's collective ads.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have started questioning matters and wanting to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
The artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many of them are moving to work with the activists of protestists.
One of the anti-arm posters welcomes public transport users in the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook over 100 000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the times have also done its work without compensation.
The artistic director of VCCP, Matt Lever, tripped the absence of the messmanship and an empty spot in the ExCeL event calendar. He said, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get tired of a more realistic, blurred business video, but bright colors and animation are better attracting attention."
"They have done a great job and helped us raise up the messs that practice illegal torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded at our home doors."
However, perhaps the most creative anticipation of weapons fairs is present in excel exhibition facilities, where the samplers use the vastly circular expressions of their commodity.
In the press release, Saab announced the order made by the United States Army on the "paid AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specially-formed warhead, which is effectively invaded directly into the target."
Doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight gold rules for people living in student dwellings
I moved to the student apartment 11 years ago, and I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but now I remember the violent smiles I irritated, and countless, long complaints to others.
The most important lessons I can summarize with eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment is the least burdensome experience and, at its worst, shocking.
In the situation, it's easy for you to talk: you tell everyone what you are, what you liked in the middle of the year and why you like Corbyn and why you don't “rightly hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast, hahhahaha, I'm in my room”.
Take some time to breathe.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other questions.
Questioning guides the conversation and helps you to find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your lips were in a glimpse and these people would share shutters.
Give the rest of the world room.
Your own rooms often serve as drink dishes, movie theatres and general residence accounts, but your own room is also a place where you are dressed, from underwear.
Add the subject: Do not even imagine combining dating and university studies
The University of Introvertes is a tough place
The room should be a place of restoration. However, many of the apartments form a social culture that travels from room to room and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go away so that I can download back the energy I used to date with you."
Try to find out if one of your students is tired of social relations. Maybe you shouldn't knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student apartment, there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcomed inside.
He saw a lot of things.
Get some friends by baking.
You'll start your study properly when the baking is in, so if you bake browns and knock someone in the door, you don't seem like a 50s, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I smilk you for personal things."
Homemade sweets are a great way to get new friends.
Your student friend has to talk to you, and it's a tasty surprise that gives them a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable baking skills from you.
If you serve unhappy flour, sugar and fat - grained cookers, others probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Swimming food is also a common break in students' apartments.
To take another chicken is, of course, stealing, but can you get your tea to drop a drop from someone else's barbecue?
Always make sure the owner of the milk bag.
You are likely to receive permission, even though the quote of milk from the owner of your barbecue.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone wanders something from you, but try to deal with the situation as grown-uply as possible – unlike my fellow student, who washed his milk into a washing machine to punish the dairy thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't be noisy when everyone else is trying to sleep or fuck.
It's not just because it's polite, but it's worth remembering that each other's holes are digging...
In my apartment, a girl asked the next room to set the music stains lower, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally shut up in the neighborhood, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours to go to the exam, leave the music to shak in her room and lock the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate moved to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought that your student friend was your future spouse, would you start dating, divorced, and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends?
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if his student friend isn't absolutely the only right one, try to control him.
If you notice in a wheelchair moment that someone has forgotten his keys in a room that has not been locked, the limit for trick and temptation is more dazzling than he could think.
It's a good joke, but it's a good one that'll recover in a moment.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be messed up with toothpaste and shaving.
The other room door can lock and drop the keys into a water glass that is placed in the freezer, but do not attach anyone's goods to the roof with a blue rack a couple of times more.
A racist attack on foreign students' home in Kite - The house that was planned for the reception centre was struck in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kitea in Northern Karelia was carried out at the home of foreign students.
Unlike the police earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities of minor asylum seekers but the sleeping facilities of foreign students already in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Evangelical Academy of Kite.
The windows and walls of the facilities of the National Convention were tampered with racist marks, such as scatters, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation space, says the Itä-Suomen police.
According to Luke, according to the responsibility teacher of youth social guarantee training at the National Convention, there were estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," says Luke.
The university has been hosting people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All the people in this messed up building have a status.
Some of them study in adult basic school, some are in professional studies and some learn Finnish," says Luukas.
The status A is the so-called continuous residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreigner who has already been in Finland.
The Itä-Suomen police are investigating the attack as a result of damage and breaking home peace.
According to Luke, the event was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had so many decades of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens", says Luukas.
According to Luke, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been moving on a light passenger car.
I think that this is the end of the youth weekend night when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," says Luke.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about this on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital's wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
It's been filed to the police for criminal records.
Adjustment 15.9 at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y train to Karjao, passengers in their heels, "good idiots"
The Y train passing from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjara stops passing in March.
The news disgusted the passengers on the main railway station in Helsinki who rose at the early night of the train.
In particular, the downstream is hit by the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's very idiotic, because the population increases all the time, and workers need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This cannot be attached to anything but political will or its lack.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video, he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
Train changes are also happening elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined to a new R line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry of Finance will buy the train during the following contract period.
The contract period is changing in the course of the year and the routes to be dissolved are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siunthian, believes that the state's train cutting is a short-looking activity.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then you'll be repentant.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and civilians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Espoo’s Annina Powder was harmed by the train from the urban area to the destiny of the travelers.
"It is utterly miserable for those who have to reschedule their journey," he said when he pained his Y train.
There's a little relief on the line.
There must be a new train connection coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the area of the Helsinki Region’s transport (HSL), i.e. take it to the Church Numme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately assess the costs.
Rihtniemi states that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year for the Y train, of course, much more.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions.
Instead, the number of train shifts is doubled in Ainola and Sauna Kalio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes in the whole country will cease.
The Ministry no longer buys train transport from the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The train shifts are reduced on routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made per year in the day when the total transport purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State's annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
The Sixth Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeline book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The global crisis has raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final edition of Capital in 1867-1894, writes the timeline of Marx's capital in the book today published by Mr Hakane as former President of GDP.
"He's being taken more seriously than for a long time now," writes Hakanen in his premonition.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and intrusion in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly far-reaching.
Aalto University professor, a valued economic operator, Sixten Korkman, can also be found on the list of writers of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is the timely "you and forever".
But the former CEO of Business Research and Business Delegation is not Marx, is it?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today social sciences are isolated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, an economic scientist, a journalist, a political agitator and a literary lesson.
"The common idea is that the history of the past tells the wrong opinions of dead men," begins Korkman.
The truth is, Marx's predictions have gone very bad.
Even though Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of the capitalism, Korkma wonders.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical positioning.
"The more important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We will now again discuss the points of interest of Marx, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical inflation," Korkma analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow isn't helping Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, it's worth working with Marx in Korkman's mind.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maoans and trots and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today the debate is more diversified, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political load of back years.
"Every societal scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like the other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals to be judged in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war of Sri Lanka, says the AFP News Office.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as the Tamilites.
In the civil war of Sri Lanka, it is estimated that at least 100 000 people died.
There's no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last few months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, and the UN report is required.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces Report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims of men as women.
According to the report, rebels have been committed to forced by sidelines and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not allow the establishment of a United Nations Court because foreign judges.
In England's yo test, it was possible to weigh social media.
In the autumn academic writings, Wednesday was on the turn of a long foreign language, the majority of which had English.
His skills in England were tested by over 16,000 experiments.
The test could have written a substance about social media.
Based on their own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the word 150-250 in English could show the administrator of the website’s advisor.
The title was the Aunt Dear Agony.
Aunt Agony is in charge of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
She had to ask her questions about how parents could also look at things for young people.
In total, there were four topics of the substance that had to be selected one.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses the third topic in Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school teacher Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a sitt from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was really nice.
It had to write a fire speech why companies should hire young people to work.
"One at least in our school, we've been trained to write speeches," says Lybeck and assesses the whole test as normal."
In the English experiment in Finnish - or Swedish - it was possible to answer questions about the texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of the summer chamber to climate change and the processing of large masses of information.
On Wednesday, some Russian students (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when it comes to a test of another domestic, Swedish or Finnish.
In the upper secondary schools, the test will be arranged normally, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The student degree board invites the experts to find appropriate contacts in time to get to the trial.
Even more time may be granted if you can demonstrate that the delay was not due to your own carelessness.
In Oulu, they robbed a trade with guns and threats.
The store was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering squad wardrobe.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators to Helsinki - support batches from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against government operating decisions will block the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicts the police.
In advance, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Open and the STTK Alliance shall meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
It is also believed that the police are involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads to the rail road are closed from motor vehicles for a period of about 9.30-14.
Only alarm vehicles are released in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from the Caisaniem traffic circle, from the west direction of Mannerheimi.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it looks like that's enough.
I'm not taking a position on police work fighting.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming to support patrols from elsewhere in Finland due to the demonstration of mentality.
They don't tell us exactly what the police are doing.
"Something is coming, but, in general, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police call for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic stunt extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standby traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With demonstrators from other countries from Finland, Helsinki is also coming with a lot of orderbusses.
They're not allowed at the Railway.
The buses are going to be far away.
Then the rest of the journey must walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side.
The flooding issue of mass transport, which is normally handed over in these large crowds, will now be dealt with in part.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of government counterparts in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mental expression to be smooth.
People are ordinary working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," says Kujala.
On Friday, local expressions of mind are also organised across Finland.
On Friday, the expression of mind is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The big expression organized by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä emeritus Martti Siisiainen.
It's not a miracle that the Ay movement protests.
If it weren't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Coolie says.
The very rightful government has hit the core points of the Finnish Corporatism tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard choices are missing in contract law.
There are many traits here that ay-moving is really trying to get on its knees.
Also, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have all the employees' support for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep distribution that the demonstration of the mind will result in amongst those which the ay-liike would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from each side of Finland showed their views at the parliamentary house in November 1993.
If you were looking for a reference point for a Friday demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Shijainen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorsta gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho (Central) government struck from the labour market crisis to the point of view.
It was said that between the Finnish government and the employees' associations had never been as bad as that of Aho during the porn government.
Now, between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than the Murrostorstad for a while.
Besides, there is now a very porvarial government in Finland, says Coolian.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so tightly rightful, despite the words of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the stainless.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day homes and schools.
Although not receiving undistributed support for employees, it may become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
They're all on the side.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have been hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
The demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of the property, says Cooler.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of the demonstration changed.
The EU's membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get a pig shit on them.
The fireman strike took three months in 1998.
There were also signs of strikes, including pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical laws in the 1970s
The main strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal strike.
The bill was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received an increase of 16%.
The electricity strike lasted 49 days in the spring of 1977 and caused electrical failures around the country.
Murrostorst in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people, many of them, who had made the recession unemployed, met for the representation of the parliamentary house, to express their views on the work.
Firemen striked three months in 1998
The fireman strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught by egg rain during the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops" was one of the phrases.
Espale's farmers drove snow tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn haystacks before the meeting place.
The nurses strangled in 1983 and 1995
The nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
Some of the deaths that occurred during the strike in 1995 were coloured by the strike.
The attack threatened with strikes and the resignation of nurses in 2007.
The threat of resignation has finally accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors strangled in 2001
"Doctors at the break - escape", was part of the strike clause of the strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and led to a rigorous discussion on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marching for their student support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliament building in 2013.
Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of Finnish trucks filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police to help out the backgrounds of the Finnish registered refugee truck.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with a truck with 42 refugees.
There is no information on whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
The people on the cold truck were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the scene of the event in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, refugees travelling with a truck in Austria became more fateful.
At that time, 71 passengers on board evidently died by choking.
According to the Austrian public broadcast on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreign-fashioned, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Irakisms have been arrested for human secrecy.
A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug-driver and a smuggling businessman, a story of five smugglers.
Upporikas king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and self-righteous cab driver.
For example, such people engage in human secrecy in the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed tens of smugglers and their "users", and the book The Travel Office of Death will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human secrecy, propose solutions and present smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
The archipelago islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the tunisians are headed for the summer ceremony.
On behalf of their position, the islands also fit excellently for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa belonging to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a burning captain in the chain and a father of six children.
The archipelago islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir's done hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
After spending, Emir earns about 8 000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of tunicians wanted to escape trouble.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis ran out again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will place them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers just survive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer loses the money, it is their problem.
We'll go to the water by midnight.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in 20 metres of high waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the destination, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants him to be scared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the anoyors to death.
He says in the book that when the police once struck him, he threw all his passengers across the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I was one of the customers on the neck, and I threw them across the edge," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen are going to have to assault this.
I'm gonna beat them out right now.
We have to show them immediately who's in charge here.
It's just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Bogovasha in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling at last, and it's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre without their family, men stay in tents, oranges and abandoned cars, which anyone has now managed to find or build.
families living in the forest who have not filed a asylum application in Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the wildernesses, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of cross borders and weekly walks in a difficult landscape, often in mountain areas and dark.
When finally arrived in the territory of Bogovasha, a large human secrecy point, people are fatal.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrians, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best clients are the Syrians, he's in the book.
"They say what they do once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to tink.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, the price will be EUR 300, then fall to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," she says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than others and he's going to charge only EUR 50 per person on Hungary's border.
There are three hundred kilometres of road, mostly the highway.
I hear my colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about €50,000 a year.
It is not a big amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the short paths and takes his rider a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his clients the right direction and shine away.
In the work of grace
A 35-year-old congolaism is called Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers who escaped from Congo, and a small centre to help congolics.
In addition to preaching, the Mission preacher is running a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He shines his shoes several times a day and ensures that the white shoulders’ rubber cloth is stylishly curled under the low belt.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrace car, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and moves forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls someone from the Poster’s five phone numbers.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hides the money out of your hands and settles with the shoppers crossing the border.
In order to obtain a refugee or refugee status from the Uganda authorities, it must be said that it is from the war zones of North Kivu, for example, and that it has been forced to escape violence from its home.
Often it is true, but if it isn't, the missionary will organise a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
It helps us contact the Missionary in the Uganda Police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the NGOs, eventually the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become refugees in Uganda.
He invoices each portal separately: submitting an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and moving to some European countries, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and icefruits
Tom's a start-up smuggler, an ex-drug criminal.
The 4th-year-old Irish guards on the French coast in Calais, where his work is to load people to trucks on the way to Britain.
He has an Afghanistan, a French cab driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in a human secret business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais's center.
They're driving the A26 highway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be put in jail for an illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs his customers across the motorway to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they go across the channel across the British.
Tom's picking a suitable truck, we need to make sure that it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and cut off the protective cover.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Well, sometimes the driver's involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into a aluminium foil, the same thing that is wrapped around a bakery or oven potato in the kitchen.
It's supposed to stop the police from spotting someone who's hiding.
Some use sleeping bags filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver doesn't drive a sudden smuggler, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Upporical Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undeniable king of the Mediterranean illegal landscape, which controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money available.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship fraud: Turk ports are rented with a snack of fun to take Americans or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded in full by Syrians, Iraqi people, Kurds and Afghanistan, who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to a sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until they are ready to leave.
People get into minibuss and drive someplace on the coast.
They're told to hide amongst vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it's given, we have to get onto the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Maritime Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury trip after the costs.
He does not handle practical things himself, but he hires captains, recruiters, guards, accommodationrs and other smaller ones to do the work on his behalf.
During the summer season, transport is organised at least hundreds and Küçük is making millions.
He is thought to have bought the land, the pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party's representative and a drug entrepreneur.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: This book of the Death Travel Office will be published, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner reports in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, the 500 yard runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about ending his career and being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in the top condition and ran in the cargo for the second best time.
At the final, however, he was panicked.
At the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership on a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself above the goal line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had made a year before Sydney's races, suicide, and he himself felt huge success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of having sex with strange men.
He also confronted his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money in a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was also that he needed similar adrenaline pics as he had received when he competed in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published a article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at 3,57.40 in the world's statistical cycle, but remained the last in Sydney's Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance controlled the Norwegian skiing flower: "Superselling"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and Norway's skiing union have turned down the whole summer and autumn like last year's athlete agreement.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better agreement than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplication of world champions and an Olympic winner.
The result of the contract dispute was the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
Astrid Jacobsen, a double world champion, received a decision.
He said he was happy that the alliance controlled the ski flower.
"Thank you for showing your spine," wrote Jacobsen in his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow an active athlete to avoid working for the Union's sponsor," he continued.
The argument between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Northug, apparently, would like to be part of a seasonal national team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a covenant that also caring for future generations, and not give one athlete on solo.
At the same time, he reminded me that the Union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published his own release on Tuesday, in which he assured him that he wanted to play sports in the Norwegian colors next season in the world cup as well as then in the MM races and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen, in total, won six MM medals, two gold medals.
Last winter, he was involved in a team that won the message gold in Falun.
The shielding day of the bakers is also celebrated in Northland
On the day of the Turtle 25.9, stunts are held in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded a Past Turner's shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finnish high-level food skills and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the meaning of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that all high-level restaurants have not concentrated on the capital region, but that the top restaurants that have been checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the turtles and the organization.
In the northern country, a restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks is held in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town will attend the turtle day.
The event has also attracted significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events that will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Setting up the Kauhava reception centre a complaint for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in cooperation setting up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-varustuses currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complainant, the region continues to have a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, the Finnish Erillis nets Ltd.
The Kauhajoki magazine states that, according to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building block would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have an interest in the area of the former Air Military School and the airport, which has no impact on the preparation of the reception centre, the paper will write.
The case states that for the last two years in Kauhava, negotiations have been conducted on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person notes to the Ombudsman that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
The distant city government dealt with the reception center thing last Monday.
Nationality: Syria’s situation reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that immigrants and people here have the necessary conditions, so the societies will comment to the suppliers in the evening after meeting the Chairpersons of all parliamentary parties in their office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern of the management of the refugee situation was aligned with all the participants.
He considers it worthwhile that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
In particular, at times when we face major challenges
According to the So.Ge.A.AL, the Syrian situation and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The societies are hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the societies, the issue of NATO was also sivued in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media researcher: Sipila takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not want to assess the frequency of the repeated way of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated on the sides of Yle.
If other channels sign up as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech for citizens.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
The pig's taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television talk is not about a more general government-in-house turning.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly and to refuse a public debate on questions? Anu Koivunen, Professor at the University of Stockholm, is concerned.
The recent comment by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin on the fact that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of the democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not connected.
The coyunen understands that the commercial media is disgusted by Sipila's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communications styles are not advisable in democracy.
The role of the media's representatives is to make a specific effort not to adopt politicians' agents as given.
According to coherence, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way or in a different way or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old ones in the permit, it must be wondering why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this respect, it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is stamped as a message from politicians or delegations and governments, which is certainly not in accordance with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A squirrel bet from Sipil
In the future speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media scientist.
The evening should be carefully looked at where Sipila is missing and not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Kuut, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipil, because this is how it can bring up its own view without noises.
This will bring a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike in a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipil passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because more precise questions are not allowed to be raised.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, it's sweating, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government informs about something, because this person is talking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
It's very exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo really considers the speech of the Prime Minister to the citizens as exceptional.
He said that in decades, there has been no such thing that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the forthcoming blackmails.
Employee organisations shall organise demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
The President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter, that Sipila could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (Sc.), again, announces that he is challenged to the dialogue with Sipila.
We don't have time for the monologs.
It's about six months from the elections.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne's writing on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
THE POIKA IS IN THE TIME AND IN THE KUNN, the son’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finnish Police Department also confirms the issue for the Ilta magazine.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later this evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped us find them.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an amazing balance in such short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildlife of young people: you are anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurditausta freelance fighter, published a video on Facebook, appealing particularly to immigrant-backed young people.
Makwan Amirkhani had a heavy speech against young people's street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and a five-year-old with his family in Finland, has so far won both of his professional match in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani says he's got a message that asked him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been downloaded with videos where young people fight with extremely violent taps.
Amirrkhani says he's disappointed in the wildlife of young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other side, and smash eyelessly without thinking of any of the consequences of this, when you do these videos, is updated by Amirkhani.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on the videos are immigrants' backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinose, fight videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in the country.
That's exactly what you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants in Finland.
These individual cases have become quite brutal.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you'll be pretty long guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for letting you be here, says Amirkhani.
My Amirkhan urges young people to remember their closest.
If they ever become targeted by some racism, you may blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go with me, guys.
Amirrkhani says that violent action will be contributing to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like.
You're going to be pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter, that the recipient organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings made by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would submit his own proposal to the government to achieve a 5% productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest SAK to soften its previous position.
On the other hand, the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in short words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the market lock" and that agreements concluded by the active parties are needed in the position of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Government of Prime Minister Sipile for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
The Sipila earlier closed the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity gap.
Comment: A big point of view threatens to pound - "It's a bit funny to wear a fist"
Well, it feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary in the payee camp from the top to the top.
Is the government supposed to be shouting to revolt, or is it supposed to be settled with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders exploded holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the undermining.
The OAJ threatened by closing schools and day-care homes.
Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK Organisation, appeared conciliatively.
He said that he kept in touch with the government and had prepared the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) for a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Kok), the president of the schedule, has prompted immediately to announce that his reconciliation paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to settle when the federal leaders just on Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK will seek solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipila's government.
The right hand of the fire, head of STTK's social impact, Jukka Ideus, formerly acted as Special Assistant for Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire is characterized by the fact that the government's ay-skills have improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but the fire exit took a bit off the Finnish standouts, whose coincidence is the ACP Marko Pirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duuma president, Sergei Naryshk, criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duuma President, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the September session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Narysh also made extensive comments on the July Helsinki Conference.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to the meeting of the European Union's sanctions, to the issue that the President was going to remind journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news office, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshk.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became a complicated one, so Naryshkin continued to squeeze Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for "good organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting that was held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that Parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met an Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), leading to the meeting at Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff trophy: "Present paintings"
Killpara and Luukko continue in Hakamets today for bull days when both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today, in Hakametsa, there's no real goal party.
Killpara went to Kuopio last night to chase a 3-2-foot win from Kalpa.
The rise was manly, because the silver group of the last season was the worst of the two goals in the loss station.
The lock Tuesday was a better molest winner.
The Raumani catch was the guest of Blues, who was retired, with round zero points, and loss figures as well as 2-3.
Tough game, the goals in tight, if any plays the same game as last year, the Lock-Blower Janne Lahti anticipates the positions on the sides of the club.
The killer has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the creeps.
In the last two years, Tappara has just fallen from the final series of Luko.
On both occasions, a crucial seventh match has been required.
During the last season, the lock took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next sides and over.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, except in the case of paint vacuums.
The casinos who rejected both of you yesterday will receive a slope shift today.
On the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: The apocalypse is running
Sports director Toivola handwriting an inappropriate extension to the main trainer Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky film where he was acting as the main part.
The subconscious sent a sensational campus with the heavyweight series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola handwrited a restless ash story to Pori.
Anonymous and wooden paddle made a surprise for everyone at the SM Finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but stiff pools like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop game, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Hopela was one of the heroes.
The manwriter Hopela believes that the news work of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who has just worked as a sports manager has built a pope for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have ruined the giants in the chamber like Rocky's pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kupariis are worth some other than a linguistic game.
Hopela has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main part is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Collar Sean Connery.
The Iron Kallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original session in the Rocky of Hopela.
There's no other name than Rocky in the iron calculus.
The game philosophy of the iron calculus is not part of rushing and swinging.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
Last year, the Ace Garret Stafford threw the Tapper Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2 plus 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put him in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an ace hockey, a hot-rolled Raud Kallio twisted after the game for the people of the Satakunta.
The team of the recent season has been oddly built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, jackasss.
There aren't practically key players in the best game age.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence the players' acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the procurement and unfortunately, the market situation was rather limited, the Iron Collion responded diplomaticly.
It's underneath the surface.
The yearly model of 1953 The Iron Collective is known to be interested in moving to Hopela to a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance in the three league games of the season is equal to a number of losses in the difference in painting 1-6.
Hopelan would not have been worthwhile writing the further part.
Olga Temonen is acting like Sipe Santapuk's mother.
Olga Temonen will reveal that if he had met his husband when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen, for the first time acting in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actor and producer Olga Temone laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna You made us beautiful in the movie is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
The circa tsemppa and supports his son, even though his father, Risto (which is presented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of mind.
The more I've seen my true image in Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has come closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone, communicated.
The circa has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
And fortunately, we also understand that the drama is a drama and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga underlines that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really nasty.
There was a pretty small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth from Tuuka before the movie plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skate.
Olga was a day and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the highest level, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga said he's been working so hard with Tuuka in 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production team will go to Heinola for a month.
Although Iiti’s couple is often planning to drive home for the night because it is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have warmly accepted us, only asked which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
The budget of the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, guided by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Vuorensola begins to film the Iron Sky 2 film in October in Belgium.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's follow-up, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive film in Finland all the time with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously on the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation in place will also rise after the Iron Sky 2 is completed, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa start in October near Antwerp near AED Studios and last eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare you.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I'm so relaxed about a fictional manuscript because I know exactly what kind of a movie should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, and he'll tell the evening magazine.
Initially, 8 to 10 million were planned for the budget of the film, but as the manuscript evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million would be allowed to enter the film because each angle and power is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loose ends.
On Wednesday, Iron Sky Universe, a film production company launched a mass-finance campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and by supply during the campaign.
At least two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The activity film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What's up? Or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the Trends have recently decorated the big logos.
Another time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsa in a conspiracy.
Advertising the cuckoo or t-shirt marks was seen somewhat as a cuckoo.
But the times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports stamps such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness wave brush.
And as so often before, a funny and trendy border is shining: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
At first, the standard core practice, the tavis fashion, where the trenders were surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes as a means to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey base college, it already buryed on the bottom of the cabinet with a look at the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas trackers, the favorite team's gambling shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logs are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from athletics to luxury bands.
For example, the chest of Versace's sculpture makes it clear what kind of dress it is.
Would you be ready to introduce the logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn't stick in the tank for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which was held in Russia Arms Expo, which presented the products of the Russian military industry.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotovia from the tank block for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to squeeze a tanker from the door in a very good atmosphere, and at least on the basis of these images, it is not about falling or getting mad.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a battle tank, but it was a raid tank of BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in Ural.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolska and Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel, in his exhibition, the new engineering of Russia, because he was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I was thrilled for our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all the tanks and all the rushpant wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the editor who wrote it as a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and rotting, but nothing that I would've stuck somewhere in the tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
The words of Zotov support the fact that no photograph of the alleged imprisonment has been published, although in a few days there were a total of 50,000 people at the weapons exhibition.
The argument that Zotov was stuck started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told that he ripped out of the tank hole while trying and threatened to finally shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way he sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

Agnico Eagle Finland’s Kittilän mine has been leaked by a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand in its yard.
According to the company, measures to remedy the leakage have begun.
In the pool there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foam process.
Usually water is pumped for re-use as process water or is managed in accordance with authorisation through the surface coating field into the environment.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the material came into the environment.
The leakage was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been detected to cause structural damage to pool patches.
The company tells us that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report, published by the International Monetary Fund, published today by the IMF, respects largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization was confronted with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuopamäki, Danske Bank's main economist, structural reforms are in agreement, but there are little differences.
The IMF's assessment of the government's activities has a great deal of sympathetic message, but on the other hand there are also words of the warning on what should not be too much cut.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% for this year, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today that growth will remain zero this year when the new cycle is predicted.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported the total production in the summer in a small growth rate, says Kuopamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the difference is only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, under the authority of Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, started his work on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for a successful Wii Console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible successors of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research Analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to be seen by taking Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gambling consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
The Swedish Immigration Service already acknowledged in February 2015, that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their websites, according to the Swedish Migration Office, hundreds of minors disappear annually.
Inspector Juha Kannelmaa, the Immigration Agency, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear from "lower country" per year?- In 2013 a total of 156 minors received a single application for asylum.
They disappeared from nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and they disappeared from 11, Kannelmaa reports.
In the context of the disappearance, it can be found that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been found to be full-age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014 the applicants for asylum in Finland had a total of 3651 persons, of whom 134 of whom the application was made because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 requests for asylum from a minor alone.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is well known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have been given a decision?
Are they lost, for example, in the "blind labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the appeal decisions, Kannelmaa.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered countries.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU Ministerial Conference on Refugees, Orpo reported on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - look at the pictures of the equipment.
Because of the seizures, Timo T.A. Mikkosen's equipment for television and radio production is now sold.
Mikkosen's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment in Huuto.net, which were the most advanced professionals in his field.
The Internet report was the first one that reported the Internet magazine Iltamacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs will no longer be filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these too are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasms - collectors and their own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Michaels are trying to move away from their current Storm East home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent a bit of trouble and see what things are being given up.
That's what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer a personal use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real lifework was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials in the box store from Stormskylä.
Traffic threatens to fall worse than thought: Metro and tramways can stop for the whole Friday
The metro and tramway drivers today decide whether or not they extend forces in relation to the recession of Friday.
The original plan was to stop the subway and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, you'll figure out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Truster Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly squeezing drivers, so the government's plans to cut the lizards raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that stopping transport all day is a dilemma.
If the subway and tramways stand by Friday, public transport is practically almost completely stopped in the capital area.
According to VR, trains do not travel on Friday between 6:00 and 6:00 in the morning.
On Friday, there's no traffic in the nearest or in the distance.
The trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the fortress.
The members of the ACP will be gone from work on Friday from 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven; they will be driven by superiority, the HSL reporter Pirkko Repo assumes.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell us exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employees' organisations will be organizing a demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Theatre on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used tears gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the AP News Office.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border aid.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, escaped in the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tyres against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, a 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher kept him at school a self - defective watch bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he was just trying to show him the output of his electronics.
But one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the youth arrest cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police, but it was known to be composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days in forced leave from school.
His father is furious and the American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is another evidence of islamophobia in the United States.
United Kingdom on - Labour Director refused to sing the national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent to the monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also joined the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has been insulted by the people, suspected by the Labour Advocate Kate Green broadcaster at the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
The last Memorial was respected for the British Air Force Flighters’ fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroicity of royal airpower pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect during the national song, and the opinion stressed.
Corbyn's choice as a party leader has divided the labour lines.
Especially among the representatives of the people who are afraid to expel moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, cessation of savings and increasing public expenditure.
Corbyn is due to be present today for the first time in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron rode in a weekly Twitter on Corbyn's choice as a party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and our family safety, and the Prime Minister televisioned on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota’s family death is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a case.
South Lake Minnetonka's police have soon investigated the family death in Minnesota Greenwood.
A five - souled family was found dead in his home on 10 September and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife with a shotgun and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police went to the house to check and found a huge house on all sides of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a successful company
The South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses designed to social media on the site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014 at the StarTribune interview Short said there were four million different visitors per week.
I've been offered 50 purchases in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011, by the Short’s family buying a hulpe house in Greenwood with two million dollars.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are only 12 rooms in the house, including eight cars in sufficient garage.
The case is underway.
According to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various preppaus courses, had challenged him to court because of the comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments were deleted from Short's website and therefore had lost customers to its competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on the short business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee.
In addition, the owner-thirds were awarded at the dietary event by the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner award.
That's great. Loiri's commenting on his good-looking desk.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused with Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think that's happened.
According to Loir, the Coach of Successshevose will receive full peace with the horse while working with him.
It's the stack and decide where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri squeezed.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens’ superstar P. K. Subban has contributed $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the medical news, this is the largest athlete of all time in Canada for charity.
In addition, Subban, 26 years of age, is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with Canadiens eight years ago and $72 million worth a year ago.
Subban’s contribution is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars.
Subban receives a titled lobby from the hospital for its award.
The players in Canadiens have used to help local hospitals significantly before.
One year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same childcare hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital, which gave the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese coffee can order a wife's evening, serves only bikini and bikini.
The diamond cafeteria is a tough deal in Japan.
There's already a goat coffee shop, a cannabis cafe, a vampire coffee shop, a hay coffee shop, and now a wife coffee shop.
It hits the lonely, the cravings and the hunger.
The Metro told me about it.
A coffee from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my wife) can be ordered for a wife or husband's evening.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Poliso" will be selected from the list before the coffee shop comes, and he will prepare and serve the food.
The wife is opposed to just a gadget and bikini on top, and a husband in a tight bikehorses.
The website offers all the information about the length and pressure of the wife candidates to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep.
Soon, 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against automobile security began to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the Intel release reports.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and distribute online data.
We can, and we need to improve cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber safety is a major component in the design of each vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
The Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in the processing of information.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as a moon rising.
Eventually, the car is starting to be in the vicinity of Finland.
Ford published RS information now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerating with 2,3 litres of 350 horsepower engines in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed in 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, it is originally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when they report.
The favorite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - these are the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish, it is certainly more important than two new news, the new Sportage of the fourth generation, where Kia intends to capture a larger wing from the ever-growing streets market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaum, created by Sportage, is rounder than before.
One inch has come to the axle intermediate and outward dimensions, and the car is going to crack more efficiently.
The engine range is mainly unchanged, but it has been added to a turbo with 1,6 litres of horse power.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported to be closer to the sales.
It has to be waited a little longer, as we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the year's change, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Quickly, the news doesn't seem to change, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of high-speed buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher levels of equipment.
At first, Optimas with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of gasoline engines are obtained.
Next summer the pace will accelerate when an Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
At the same time, with its income, the sales of Optima-farmar begins.
Chisu came back to the stages and blew in a brave hustle.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's a beautiful, open neckhole in the electric blue trouser suit.
The costume is beautifully introduced by the singers in the star's siro belt.
The whole is crowned by golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During three years of the break, a singer who became a mother has gained the kg of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer published his first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish a new and fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternal style is reluctant again... now you can see the chest.
The true-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the topics of each other.
She presents her childhood stomach and breast-fibrely in sexy clothes last night at 1 A.M. time when she left her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, her husband, Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored brass under the dress when lighting lights.
The last time Kardashian dressed up in amateur maternity suit when he went to her friend's dinner invitations in New York just a few days ago.
The chart was highlighted by the black overgeneration boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift had its way of pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Mano Leloup wanted a short idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Public dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season begins from nowhere.
Even if you'd posed in top designers' costumes during the previous season, the new season begins with castings again.
And every season comes new, fresh faces that compete for work with constables.
The models rarely have a place they can call a home.
The work is continuing to travel and can take a year to have a hotel room or apartment to which fashion halls accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop a pound, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
For fashion philosophy models and designers are all the time together and operate as the same support network.
When the fashion logs run out, the difference is odd.
The models want it to be given to this sector for the opportunities it offers, but they feel that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Even the models want to be their own person.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with some role.
But you can also express yourself in your model's work.
You were on the Tory Burch show last night.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers reveal their designs next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulant musician in the movie
Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala, in the Apulanta group, based on the first years.
In 1991, the lautala set up Apulanna with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rapist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to the people, so I think it's good to learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to do a human implication.
A man who can trust the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is completely empty, doesn't go to the role.
The Punk maneuvers come with the man in nature.
The stars, the stars, in the punk period, surely many saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, you were announced today by the main actors of the beautiful film, the Tuukka Temose, who called the basso.
The group of nuclear teams that are familiar with the band is still quite unknown to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki performs Teppo Manner, singer of Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo Based on Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future debris last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in the mustache and the jaw beard, has turned his face into siloposk, and coloured his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or should you tell me about it at all?
There is no need to take this up forcefully, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises the psychologist.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and trouble, he says.
However, if a child has encountered a TV newsletter about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about it.
It is good to have a discussion on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that parents think he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're embarrassed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves stay calm during the discussion, the child will feel safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter a discussion of refugees in school, friends or online.
Parents should be happy to take this into consideration with them if they think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world aren't doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how our family feels about this.
However, in the end, do we think that the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have a variety of educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from distress wherever possible.
On the other hand: If a family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Study your child to help the weaker"
My powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Vermonic Ball Salama
Pertty North got a slice of Apila's Ball salama in the middle of the summer.
It only dramatized profits and second places until the collapse occurred in the Tampere rays at the end of July.
Since the Ori was completely defyed, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the veterinarian to his guard.
The explanation of the shutdown was cleared in the inauguration.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the weakest in the head, but it took two drug cubes to defeat it.
Since Apilan Ball Salama had to be undergoing mild exercises, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE station in Turku after the Taruntuule.
Apila's Ball Salama was very pressured when it had only been able to drive for a few weeks.
These things, considering a small tendency at the end, were understandable, says North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made steel for the Ori.
I'm sure the horse's vire went ahead of it, and I hope it would have even balanced.
Apila Ball Salama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been amusing, it could've thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori has removed a lightning letter that the opponents have been wondered.
In short speed, turtles can't handle the Balloon Hall, from which even the warm bloody rides can be released.
In the north's hopes, Vermo's got a spear run.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Ballsalama agrees.
It's kind of difficult at the time of departure, and it might be a swing under the hood of the driveway and something like that.
I hope the Ori would be more calm than Turku would go.
Apila Ballsalama can also come from the bow while in order, and we are going to drive it from the victory, the coach's license.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs on Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple intends to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips will come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a forced update on iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone applications are in close association with other programmes.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating it because the company does not want to waste memory space on user iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area's consumer prices rose only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-years, said the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat today.
The increase in prices was lowered by the cost of energy.
Eurostat thus revised a few weeks' interval of 0,2% of its estimate slightly downwards.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% of 1.0% of July in August.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
In the EU-28 countries, the average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most from the euro area, i.e. 1.4% in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was low as prices decreased by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent, according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percentage increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year the rise will rise to 1.1%, and the central bank expects the new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed will try to blackmail monetary policy next
The next recession in the United States begins at a speed of less than a year, but surely within three years after the NCB Fed again starts to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And on the financial market, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that interest rates should be initiated by this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at the earliest autumn and before that as a rate of financial markets.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's biggest economy and financial markets act as they have used to do, and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank’s Strategies of the London Market Survey Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive investigation of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a survey report on Long-Term Asset Return Study on over 60 pages to its international large customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
On the other hand, they play with the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the markets have previously acted during and after the Fed interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key economic and financial markets are now in the same or other model as at the time of previous interest rates - and possibly what will happen.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a more odd position to endure the increase in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Not a year to the beginning of the recession.
The leaders decided on Fedi's monetary policy and its subsequent incitement have suggested that the time is beginning to grow up in interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can be reached this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Board of the Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds guiding interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular, but at the same time 0,25 percentage points of interest, which Fed raised from 1,25 % to 5,25 %, ended up at the same time as two years.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ripped off into a global judgment nightmare.
The major recession came from 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial market and the real economy began slowly than has typically occurred since the previous Fede interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsch's strategies have screened the rises and declines in the world's major economies and the fluctuations in the financial market since 1950 and in place since the beginning of the 18th century.
Since the 1950s, they are making clear about Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts.
At the beginning of the recurrence, the first interest rate has taken the fastest period of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate of the financial market has ended within one or two years of the beginning of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has on the occasion raised and on the occasion lowered its steering rate to a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time, there is a relatively limited difference between some and others, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certainty on the effects of the following interest rates.
Strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Interests too low for too long
Without the crucial causes of the financial crisis, the culprits may not be unquestionably identified even by decades of research.
But for the reasons leading to the crisis and raising its destructiveness, there must be some unquestionably clear evidence:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other world's largest central banks held their interest rates too low.
They mounted the tracks of the technique, while growing up the next one.
2) Over the decades, over the different parts of the financial and real economy, the debt volume of the central banks increased even more over the monetary policy impact.
The biggest debt bubble of economic history was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing entailed the most financial markets' components of the financial economy's major price bubbles from shares to real estate, debt books and commodities.
It is hardly a very difficult argument that the high-level financial market for more complex debt shortfalls was rarely dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
In addition to the financial structures triggered by the debt lines, the valuation bubbles were not lasting until their time after the interest rates had begun and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche Strategies do not realize what is going to happen next, but give us the topic of nuclearism by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Liability has not been crazy for a long time as ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Therefore, the debt cargo for the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but in various parts of the economy, the debt burden is much more severe than before the financial crisis or ever before.
3) Liquidity issued from the former lower and cheaper central banks has remained mostly on the financial markets and has slowed down the key securities and assets most expensively before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only with financial market warning signals, they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the most severe recession to the model that has taken place.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks in the financial market are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is next to tightening its downfalls.
Perhaps the French bank Societe General's strategy Albert Edwards' future picture is not as strange as it may suddenly affect.
For a long time, he has trained the bank's international investor clients for the following translations:
First, Fed raises interest, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fedin is about to squeeze financial fires with even bigger QE-shoes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), manufacturing computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted by the HP business service provider, the company explains.
HP is distributed in November to the HP Inc., the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and to the Pc machines and printers for consumers.
The staff of HP was highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the single costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions of the consumer will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating performance.
In the last year, the three main customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has operated in the Government of the Tax Paradics Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Government of the Tax Paradics Company.
According to the above, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company, appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he has submitted a notice of resignation for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains will take place in a agreed timetable, Berner says at the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who joined the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was in Karelia-Upofloor’s government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs’ government and in Luxemburg.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs pass through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he received a member of the government at the Luxemburgi company, at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the government of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the capital interests of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company has no tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established in the tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs already had a capital fund for the ownership of Triton, a holding company of Luxemburg.
Espoo opens the reception centre operated by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company in Espoo Otaniem is open for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from six o'clock this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to up to 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy are agreed, inter alia, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative workplace blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for the work of the government.
The organisation also wishes other employees' centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently being given in the remarks of Friday.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization's administration meeting on a break to the suppliers.
The Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economists of the STTK have calculated that the change security included in the government competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a one-off relationship to a hundred sides of it is a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation.
Palola: Consultation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, since the government is to present a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to start preparing the reforms.
The Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable is real.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive of him all the time.
According to Palola, the STTK Agency for the field is a sick place, especially for Sunday passes.
The organisation requires the government to retreat forced legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, the Palo does not provide for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the workplace blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first day of sickness are cut, overtime payments are half-uped, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK underlines that the central organisations have called employees into a demonstration and have not been intended to strike.
The Open Fjäder Thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder thanks the STTK for preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, as the plan has already set out an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package because without the SAK, the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, president of the schedule, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare the proposal for an alternative for surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it has long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitive jump pursued by the government as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for the government's presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on the content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, talkoos," playing bingo when Sipila talks tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Vivan bingokuponki, the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy in Yle on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the corresponding previous talk, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in the course of the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
The President and ministers then held a number of radio speeches during the winter and future war.
In the 1990's, Esko Aho gave a new year's speech instead of President Mauno Koiviston, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train-person strike with a television speech.
Alone, monarchism
Sipila's speech has raised all day's criticisms and conjectures about what to come.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said: "Sipila could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, people listening.
In Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judge condemned the fact that "monarchism: the Prime Minister will tell the people what's best for them".
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipile's dialogue: "After six months from the elections.
There's no presentation from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's with the fear of @Juhachila?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on in direct transmission by the President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Hääkämies.
It's a noble one who's been judged to make Sipilä's speech.
We considered the issue and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote the whole of Finland's comprehensive publicity, a line in the news by the Director of Yle's publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we're at the Tammelos
The speech has also provoked abusiveness.
After tonight, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be combed and dressed for the best.
My mom puts on the nicest piece and my dad's gonna settle the tie on her neck.
At nine o'clock, they'll shut up on TV like before we used to be at the Tammelo's time," writes Saku Timonen.
"Do Prime Minister Sipila also mention why the government of Finland is sitting in the tax paradises of millionaires that hide their capitals, who are making laws for mercy to his other tax collectors, and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the government has no money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by Viva Green Left at the University of Tampere.
It's been published on Facebook by a bingo.
Are we hearing about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries opposed the Russian proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer, whereby the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been given up the power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaar, the United Nations ambassador of Russia proposed a plan for al-Assad to be stylish after some time.
The Western countries did not, however, take the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaar, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in the two-way debate, listed three points of plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the resignation of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we will be able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, Sit down, Mart, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari remembers the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the newspaper, but Ahtisaare said there were no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused to take over all the agreements he would have taken over.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responds to the speeches of Ahtisaare, because Russia was not at any time prepared to discuss the destiny of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
In Ahtisaar's argument, I weakened that Tshurk spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that Putin's shark would have held power in some of the supporters of Al-Assad.
The Refugee flow of our own works
During the negotiations in the Ahtisaar, about 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee from their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay the bill that we caused ourselves, the Ahtisaari will tell the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' organisation centre in Tornio
The asylum seekers' organisation centre, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be founded in the empty building of the Tornion colony in the city centre.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place for better management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the Helsingin Sanomat reported that the Board had already decided to present a school building for a state solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hööpinen, Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, that is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the teams wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
During the local debate, 36 were authorised from 43.
The Arrangement Centre was opposed to 13 officials.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, says Tuppinen.
According to the city leader Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and was rapidly responded.
It would be estimated that 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspecting that it might be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wishes a job market option for blackmails
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the pooling of holiday money in public would only be carried out by a part of the government's desire to lower the price of work.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners were able to agree on that.
Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament that he had not contacted the social partners.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for substitutes for the pressures of work reported by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipila's view, the pooling of holiday money would be a tool, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday tickets for the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present these views on next Wednesday to Parliament on the stresses of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipila, the proposals made by organisations should be known beforehand.
And this isn't the end of the line.
Legislative work will then move, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long to see if there's a will, Sipilä shaped it.
The list published by the government last week includes, inter alia, the conversion of the lobby and the helatorstat to unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary of the first day of sickness is cut, the overtime allowance is half-up, the Sunday allowance is reduced to 75% and the holiday is reduced.
The reforms are implemented as forced legislation over trade unions, which has brought strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, workers' centre organisations organise a demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Council of the Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the stock of the juice hall
The Tohmajärvi Council adopted unanimously, but slightly the extension of the stock of the mahlahalli, which is the rule of Nordic Koivu Oy.
The assessment was caused by the project being bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for order was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the sub-annual report.
The agenda was still talking about the investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000, but the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the local authorities.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a lease, Vesa Västö (ps.) justified.
Even the Karelian place in Joensuu
The city government relieved its steepest position to bring pasture street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of upholding the herd tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared to be the capital of the cattle language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the cattle is naturally part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more than part of the eastern savage fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the language of the cattle, for example, in the information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-speaking municipality, it is also worth a wide-ranging approach to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturality is living and changing strongly in the North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specialities of the county, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used to make use of the various types of marketing in the region.
Train connections cut off the region’s vitality
Train connection surgery strikes the region's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business and competitiveness.
And it affects whether we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights airlines, which has continued several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not manage to reduce our opportunities by government measures, as it is now happening.
The impact of these termination of transport links, for example, on employment, should be considered, emphasised by the Karelian.
The deterioration of transport links will give the University of Eastern Finland an additional challenge for attractiveness.
Of course, the better services are here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that bad transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels much because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, the recruitment manager, says that the marketing of the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in a cross-sectional direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently coming from outside of Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuus became one of my noises to the war of Siu
Joensuu City Government's view of the National Siu Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of my noises is amongst me.
Pentti Centralsalo (i.e., picture), member of the city government, presented the resignation of the entire project at the board’s Monday meeting, but his presentation was ineffective.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjai draft decision, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvolaan ends next year
Passenger train transport from Kotkasta to Kouvolaan will remain in the future, although one train shifter is less than one.
Passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will be subject to changes next March.
One train shifter stays out, but five times a day still gets to Kotka Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to public savings.
For the next four years, the purchase money of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys livin' off the ground.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climb on the roof, who couldn't get down on the roof by his own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketoway at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two-layer wooden house in which there are no ladders to take to the roof at all.
It did not prevent the crowd of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the masks of radiomasters next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the other travellers flipped out of the place and alerted the rescue facility to help safely return to the surface of the last on the roof.
Turnover of FedEx, weaker prospects for the accounting year 2016
FedEx announced its weakest results for the last quarter. The transport sector weakened its projections of the year as a result of a reduction in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share fell by around 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trading opening on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between 10.40 and 10.90 dollars for the accounting period ending in May.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
In spite of price increases of 4.9% on average, the forecasts have declined, and the increases will take effect on 4 January.
The company is still waiting for profit growth due to cost cuts from the previous year, higher turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has been performing in a well-expected weaker economic situation, which has been particularly involved in production and global trade.
A day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ mostly the same seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000 to 95 000 people.
In the fourth quarter of 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The profit per share was $2.42. The 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research were then left for the $2.44 forecast.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been tested as a result of a reduction in the number one international broadcasts, which has resulted in a deficiencies in the operation of the Express Unit.
The strong growth in online trade has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport turnover grew by 29 per cent, but operating profits showed an increased cost of large shipments and insurance.
As a result of higher basic charges, the Express unit was better generated, while the return on freight business fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading was opened, FedEx's stock rate had fallen to USD 3.85 or 2.5 per cent to USD 150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11% from the average of the year and 17% from the highest quote recorded on 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank’s Fed finalists will meet for the most expected meeting for years. A number of people will sit at an eight-millimeter hollow table to decide whether the time is to raise interest for the first time to almost a decade.
On the wall of the two-storeed meeting room, the central bank’s decorative wall displays a wall painting of the United States.
The map reminds us that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the State before all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from the Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, the Governing Council has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be lacking in terms of a clear decision. On Thursday, the central bank is to state whether the US economy is ready to start a withdrawal of an unpredictable irritation, which has been offered by the short-term interest rates at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data indicate that the economy is rising firmly, the recent slope of the financial markets can be completed by the prudent NCB officials to aggravat the increase in volatility by increasing the reference rate of federal taxes — even at a percentage point in the quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economic operator of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, there is an increased degree of uncertainty in the global market to provide sufficient reasons to wait," Piegza continues.
Those who were concerned do not agree on what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
Approximately half of the economists in the study conducted by Bloomberg were curtailing the increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial market is considered to be expected by the central bank and the main indicator shows that only 30% will be possible to increase.
If the central bank raises its steering rate, the stock rates may be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the attack by promising another lift.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index blew 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The background of the collapse was expectations that the central bank would maintain the interest rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's main economic operator, John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank would raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this is the case, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of those who operate on the financial markets unscrupulous."
On the other hand, the second expert stated that by increasing interest rates, it would be possible to relieve financial markets and to remove uncertainty from the time when the central bank operated.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to rise to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the financial conditions and thus strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has seen the increase in interest rates this year along the spring and early summer, despite the fact that economic progress is needed by the liberals.
While job creation slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now lowest in seven years and close to the level of full employment that the central bank is declining.
The salary income seems to be getting more enlightened
Although inflation continued to fall below the 2% annual targets of the central bank, the central bank decision-makers stated that the key reason for this is a temporary impact of oil prices.
"Talous can cope with higher interest rates and need them as long as they take into account the tight situation in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economic operator of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the global financial market is not shaking in the last month when China devales its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 percentage points of the May record height and the investors feared the decline in the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has grown up this month, and Dow Jones has now decreased by nearly 10% of May's top readings.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, the fragmentation of the market means that the consideration of the increase in the steering interest rate will be more complicated.
"In spite of what happened on the financial markets and the news of the decline in the Chinese economy in recent weeks", UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's senior researcher and former CCB official Stephen D. Oliner stated.
Now he believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy; there is little reliable information on the recent situation in the Chinese economy," said Oliner.
The restoration of the world economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body in the world's monetary economy.
The effect of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
In 2013, only a suggestion from the President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scope of its activities has resulted in retaliation around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are rigorous in each other. In addition to monitoring the world’s trends, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of the Financial Manager Envestnet Inc.
In this month, President Jeffrey Lacker from the Regional Bank of Richmond stated that the central bank has previously overreacted with financial markets that do not seem to have a link with the economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), has announced the increase in the interest rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the decision of the Central Bank at three meetings to calculate the steering interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions for the United States' economic growth were available", said Lacker.
A year later, the central bank revoked the decision.
"The central bank should prioritise monetary stability only in a significant crisis, such as the collapse of the economy in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest committee.
The last death is not even approaching the situation at that time," he said.
"With no fear of lifting the cartoons because of the shock of the market, Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability, and until this changes, I do not have to go ahead."

Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Physician Association contributes to a proper diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach women who are breast-feeding the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies being breast-feeding with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus the baby gets all the food she needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 kilocalors.
In addition to increases in calorie levels, a new study suggests further changes in diet.
The recent study of Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the genes of a baby and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was shown to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Sunris most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get a lead on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would call on Canberra to make a morning programme on the post-records of the Liberal Party's leader elections, which, however, did not much improve today's viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital after Tony Abbott was expelled by Malcolm Turnbull.
The morning program of the competing channel David Koch and Samantha Armytage was sent from London. The weekly special broadcasts are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance was not relevant to Australian television viewers, since Sunrisea looked at on average 397 000 views in five capitals of the state, and Today, on the other hand, 339 000 viewers.
Today’s number of viewers rose slightly over last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but last Thursday’s reading (343 000) was over.
Today's been stuck on a distance to Sunris in the last few months.
In August today had an average of 318 000 viewers, 330 000 on Sunr.
At the beginning of the year there was a difference between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 views and today 314 000 views.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in winds this morning will affect Parliament more.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking.

Significant news Seven had 800 Words, with the former Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells us about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached the great 1 219 000 viewers.
The critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to stare the hit series alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's viewers say that the answer is clearly positive.
Seven The X Factor retained its strong position with 1 136 000 viewers. The series was brilliantly defeated by the Block (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven The Chase Australia has imprisoned the viewers varied.
The first half-hour (17.00–17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe’s new physics series followed an average of 446 000 viewers.
On the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia’s first half had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the second half gathered the vast 720 000 viewers.
The number of hot Seat viewers was 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewers showed the Nine Channel that the Hot Sea is going to pass at 17.30.

According to the Final Triangle, Sam Wood is really a brethren of dreams – but who does he choose?
Did the secret reveal? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unintendedly revealed the choice of a boyfriend of dreams.
The final choice of a dream boy Sam Wood has been a very secure secret.
The remaining three women don't squeeze a word of who has received the last rose from the nephew.
We were asking about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows' atmospheres before one of the triangles was dropped off, and the women could be unintended to suggest who was to be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed up to Thursday's final.
All three women glowed that Wood is a perfect man, women complimented a man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considered him to be a suitable partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the last rose did not hit their own site, their answers could give a sign of who would take the boyfriend's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been making things easy since the beginning.
"After I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been maintained throughout the programme," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there is chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood are a good partner.
Mackay told me that he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a race, and now I'm going to make our relationship full," said Mackay.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, the woman answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayne has several options to start the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after this change to the United States.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coachs would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man was on the lines of the Australian Rugby Country Team. Hayne snatched the win on the flight return team on Tuesday, reading 20-3 from Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave her a new chance to return the flight. The coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued in the suit locker after the game.
He didn't rob the newcomers in front of the other team but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the Coordinator of Special Teams Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failure to capture and concentrate on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's going to get caught, in the first quarter of the game played against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL Debyy.
After the failure, Hayne left the field hundreds and later told Hamish and Andy the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he couldn't have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"This is what happens, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error in his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his feed in his own territory opened a place for Queensland.
However, the experience was incredible for a 27 - year - old young person.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram, where he poses with fans and Australia's flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are discussing gay rights
In 2003, the most rich man in Russia Mihail Hodorkovski was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who was challenged by President Vladimir Putin, was condemned, the oil company Jukos owned by the man, and his work in favour of democracy was limited.
Four dead cops shot in rubber bars in Nepal.
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of authorities told me on Wednesday, and the police shot a crowd with rubber warheads in the protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, and there was a four-year-old son among the victims.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, about three hundred miles from the capital of Katmandusta.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 demonstrators had been gathered outside the police station, some of which had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me the police used tears gas and fired the air before shooting rubber bullets.
He said twenty cops and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but which are generally considered as a less devastating alternative, suddenly were so fatal.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new nations based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in the West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own country.
At least 40 people, of which 11 are policemen, have died in violent twins since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country into the regions, this is a major step towards the new Constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where governance has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been worked since 2008, but the legislation accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses of Katmandussa this week, and the authorities believe that a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde

Google intends to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign aimed at collecting $111 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in her blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading, the campaign launched a Google employee Rita Masoud by telling them about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled in the dark with a train and a bus and we were hungry, thirsty, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe, many families in similar situations urgently need help.
Gifts are allocated to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and the UN Refugee Organisation.
After the contributions have been collected via google.com/refugeerelief through $5.5 million, Google is allowed to donate the corresponding amount, making the total up to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is then the worst in the second world war, and the situation is particularly worsening the four-year civil war in Syria, which is why over four million people have been forced to flee this year from their homes.
War must also be escaped from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetes mellitus may benefit from fattening for at least five years.
However, it is too early to tell if you are living mildly overweight type 2 diabeteses after fatigue surgery longer than those who are treated without surgery.
"Information of mortality takes time," said the doctor Robin Blackstone, who dealt with the new research in JAMA Surgery.
A fatigue surgery, a bariatric surgeon, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger feeling and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been identified as effective treatment in type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted in patients with a minimum body weight index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The weight index shall indicate the weight and length of the normal value between 18,5 and 24,9.
When the weight index is greater than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own printing index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Min-Sheng hospital researchers from Taiwan benefited from the data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, abdominal transplantation and sleeve surgery, type 2 diabetes medication in people who were mildly fat.
After fatigue surgery, the average body weight index fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The weight index of those treated with an unsub was maintained by 29 people.
Diabetes was fully improved by 36% and in part by 28% of patients treated with surgery.
In the treatment group, diabetes was fully improved by only 1% and partially by only approximately 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and malignant LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical treatment group.
Investigators also monitored haemoglobin A1c levels in patients, which reflected the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from 9% to 6% on average.
In the pharmaceutical group, the value remained unchanged by approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu noted that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
During the fifth year in the gastrointestinal surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the sleeve operation group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight reduction was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %).
In the new study, less mortality could not be demonstrated after five years. According to the Swedish study of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, however, surgery brings years of life to fat people.
In a Swedish study, the probability of mortality of fat persons who were undergoing gastrointestinal surgery decreased by 29% over the 15 years compared to the traditional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new investigation, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study because it says that surgery is safe in the lower body weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes are accumulated in the human body, which expose fatigue and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, and the Dalai Lama has identified the real solution to the current refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The lead character of thebuddhalacy of Tibetan has called for the abolition of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom, and Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, located in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation humanity should be set ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is an impossible idea that everyone could come to Europe," said Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their action in the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"It is a great act to take care of thousands of refugees, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to think about and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," emphasised Dalai Lama.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
The means of power have never solved any problems," he added.
In speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that, when relied on the forces in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would be through violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he was using the forces that had unpredictable consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Hand-dose swallowing cases in four-fold children in four years
According to Georgia’s poisoning centres across the United States, their alcoholic strength is reported to be almost fourfolded in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgian toxicological centre, the hand-drinking cases reported to the toxicological centres increased from 3 266 to 16 117 in 2010 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are in emergency aid," said Lopez to CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handicaps deliberately, partly to impress their friends and part of the social media incited.
YouTube videos include teenagers who drink disinfectant for cheap drunk.
Teachers are reported to mix disinfectant with alcoholic oral water to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handcuffs.
"The kid doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of the attractive handmade products have just been perfumed.
There are handicap products of strawberry, grapes and orange which appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45 % to 95 %.
For young children, a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content is very high," said Stephen Thornton, the doctoral director of the National University Hospital of Toxicity, to the Fox 4 Channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskey shovels in the sight of children, but if hand disinfectants are often kept available to children, they will quickly receive a high amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaijah Russell was recently enjoying four strawberries of strawberries in school, and the girl was delivered to emergency aid.
"The amount of alcohol in the blood of a girl was 179, which is double compared to the adult's humidity limit," says the doctor who treated the girl from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
Nhaijah's soap and he couldn't walk when he was brought to emergency.
The doctors followed the state of a girl in a separate child hospital overnight for brain damage, because she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told me.
"Your life was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfective wipes in addition to the need to move your hand to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been associated with death cases.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing handcuffs containing toxic substance, which had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained a lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was indicated as an active substance in the Product Characteristic.
According to the police report, three fourth-class pupils in the northern part of the state of New York were planning to kill a mean teacher in January by setting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the handwritings and denied it to be brought into the classroom.
The police thought that the plan that went away was meaningless and urged the school to take discipline.
Huhumylly: No insomnia in Celtic rows
Griffith undermines the Celtic team's inconsistency, while Deila admits that it's not all right in the team, but he thinks he'll be able to fix the situation.
Hearts buttons against SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton cautions on the January players' transfers so that the team's coherence is not affected
Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points
ADAM Rooney's first half-time punishment brought Aberdeen a little victory from Hamilton in Pittodrie Stadium.
The Griffiths are deciding on non-sovement.
Griffiths has ignored the rumors of unsuccessfulness in Celtic's lines. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not subject to surveillance when preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we have any pressure, and I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The Dutch need an old Scotland pair – de Boer
Former Rangers' Central Field Player and the Dutch team leader Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans to Celtic has been overlooked because there is no longer room for Celtic and Rangers to follow.
De Boer, who works at Ajax's team, said: "The administration no longer presents the highlights of Celtic's games.
Because Rangers are no longer involved."
"Here's not just talking about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch people need a team-to-people fight.
Old Firm's games have a huge tension, and they're also interested outside Scotland's borders."
I'm going to turn the situation down, Deila's gonna convince you.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian bullet assures us that the situation will change.
The company that lost Malmölle fell out of the Championship and lost ten players to Aberdeen, now with five points of leadership at the top of the table.
"Celtic's had difficult episodes before, and we'll get up again," Deila said.
"We want our situation to be tailored as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and in many cases it causes hatred or sorrow.
So are we, too, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, as it greatly strengthens players.
The common spirit is now very important."
Warburton Careful in January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers Boss Mark Warburton suggested that the players are transferred to January, he is taking care of the move and says that he wants to jeopardise the unity of the team.
"January players' transfers differ significantly from the summer transfers," said Brentford's ex-coach.
"The players associated with the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has succeeded in our composition this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary players can cause more harm to the team than benefits."
Michu thinking about living in Celtic's eye
The attacker in Swansea Michu has been attached to Celtic in the transponder speeches, and Michu has suggested retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
For years, Michu, a 29-year-old, has been an angering ankle, and he has not managed to get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for a SFA match for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2 to 1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defendant's red card was canceled later. It's already a third collum's red card within eight months, which will be canceled.
But Neilson stays behind his words. "I didn't question honesty, and I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded when the man admitted that he was slandering the songs of the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before the local match of Edinburgh in Tynecastle in March 2014.
The attacker said, "I can guarantee that I'm not going back to Tynecastle except in Celtic's rows."
Tannadice's management group believes in Dundee United's training board – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's management team can turn the situation better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're getting the boys ready to fight," said Donnelly.
McInnes pleased Hamilton's victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced against Hamiltonia in front of his seventh consecutive league victory, and at the victory, Aberdeen caught a five-point neck at Celtic at the top of the serial table, which is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The amount of labour forces remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed, while the number of unemployed in the UK increased at the same time by 10 000.
According to the UK Statistics Centre (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent in Scotland, with 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
There are 12 000 people in Scotland less than three months earlier, now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, the average employment rate of the whole United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
Minister of Scottish Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term plan of administration has created a basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the prison of the Oklahoma State in the execution room when Richard Glossip is executed with a toxic injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I answered the invitation yes.
When the day comes, I'm terrified.
Then why did I?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you the truth about the death penalty.
The angle of view would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and as there are more applications than places, participants will be selected with a low value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations of suppliers from 12 to five.
The following are chosen to be moderately executed.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossippi's closest friends, and I've created a man with a personal relationship because we've spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be present in both witnesses and suppliers, so I can't take a notebook and a pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my mind.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of endangering neutrality on Twitter.
"The idea is this:
When you tell the judgment story in a pleasing way, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The reporter admits that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but still thinks that my actions are wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what has happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes a movement against the death penalty.
The editor of Huffington Post Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I will not repeat the details in this regard.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him guilty after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that man Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read a neutral description about other journalists.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was attracted to Canning River after the water hunt.
The Canning Vale district officer stayed dry by attracting a man up from Canning River.
An attempt to escape a Perthian man to put him in a low, muddled water, and a police officer a few meters away got him back to the dry land.
The Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday about unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to pull the police off by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wasn't coming out of the water and called the police to pick him up in the water," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
The watering of Officer Lachlan Perhavecia's costume did not attract him, so he chose a safer tactic — a negotiation.
"Sometimes, the attempt to escape will make people resort to amusing ways," said Sergeant Castledine.
The football master Ben Cousins case is a very impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car in order to avoid the police blowing and trying to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was condemned to destruction, but the stunt inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the suppliers were trying to spy, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses competition Victoria's agents of spying company deposited last year, and he threatened to stop competition immediately.
Moody claims that journalists and Racing Victoria's Incorruption Department have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatai, due to the recent treatment of the day of the race, was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for a race sport. Moody's been in a difficult situation when there was a cobalt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has kept her tongue in control of spy charges for a half a year and did not want the prosecution to affect the bitter man's action.
"I didn't intend to raise this up, but I was thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration will be released with a single throw," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and sleeping well.
I want to go upright, and I want the horse owners to think I'll do my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to go on as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier at the Racing.com interview where he told me about the spy attempts in the Department of integrity with his stable.
Thirteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job on my stable to spy on my activities.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should make the evidence, for I have not been caught from anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, current President David Moodie and current CEO Bernard Saundry of the RVL were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I keep this a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and set responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-trainers?
Am I a bad guy?
Do you think I'm really a bad guy?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'd still have a training license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that at my speech, I'll get many people to think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I'm pressing them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can retreat."
Examination of long-lasting Lidar cobalt values and the recent rejection situation led the coach to frustrate eventually by the man threatening to abandon his license.
Moody is known as the coach of the best-beated master Black Caviar, who described the rule of the race day as ridiculous after the clay wrapped into the horse's legs in violation of the rules.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"A person belonging to my soul wrongly put savets in the horse's leg.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the race day."
Moodya may wait for a three-month ban on clay treatment which the organisers have started to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested from the Cobram crash site
The police have arrested a cycling man who ran away from the crash site this weekend.
The bike driver was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by the helicopter, and he was injured by a serious car in the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car ran away from the place and left not to help the injured bike.
On Monday, 50-year-old man from Nathalia registered to Shepparton's police.
A man is likely to expect prosecution of non-responsive and assistance obligations in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old cycler from Cobram is still in hospital care and is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the opponent's wrestling speeches
Mr. Melbourne Storm, coach Craig Bellamy, holds the criticism of the team's tactical game as an objective action of the NRL's two league favors.
According to Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters' coach, the judges gave Storm a wrestling in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos' coach Wayne Bennett covered a hard reference to Storm Broncos after winning the quarantine final on the Queensland Cowboys Saturday night, and he called the game a model game and said that Queensland did not care more about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team's tactical game and said they were just focusing on contact.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that two top team coachers criticize his team. Bellamy considers this to be a proof that coaches are concerned about losing Storm.
"This thing is always coming up. I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the wrestling when his team won us 24-2," said Bellamy Wednesday.
I guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defence system or technology all year, and the last six weeks we've just invested in contact games and tacks, which has turned us into a rise.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock for him because he has a great team that hasn't been used to losing.
It's amusing that the same thing always comes up at the same time as the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what's interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and thought their game was interesting," said Bellamy.
"In 2010 St George received a great deal of criticism for his boring game. Wayne said that the criticism would not give him a moment.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast middle-showers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you're a player-arsenal like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style. All teams don't have central players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this when other trainers are so worried about meeting my team that they are using this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of meeting us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that Storm and Roosters had more paintings than when they met Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20 to 18, and there were more situations in our game, but is it an interesting football?
Or are the slots and the lack of interest in football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit the North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday at AAMI Park.
Serbian man free from $200 000 guarantees in the drug case
A man waiting for a lifetime sentence for a 40-pound cocaine smuggling into Queensland has been released against $200 000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimcovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by a police officer from a 100 pound of cocaine cargo from a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maksimovic and his fellow Criminal Friend in the boatport for the morning and surprised two later at the Coomera Roadhouse Cafe.
Although Maksimovicia may expect a life-limit for the possession of drugs for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer says that there is no evidence that his client would have tried to take over the entire batch, but he could have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court judge, there is a risk that Maxiovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," said the judge at the court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 guarantees against which a man was released.
"After reading the testimony of both persons, it is clear that $200 000 is a real economic burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But it is not enough to prevent a man from fleeing alone," the judge warned.
Maxiovic was released on condition that he would give up both Australia and Serbia's passports, report to the police every day and stay home from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedofils to send pictures.
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to take over pictures of children being exploited.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while she was sleeping and registered to an online message service where she had another user send herself an inappropriate image of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she explained the content of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother about it.
These five pictures were reported to the police, and after examining the computers found at the address, the police found some disruptive Internet searches that used searchwords for unsuitable children's images.
Hogg told the police he tried to mislead pedofils on the Internet and pretended to be a police officer in order to scare pedofils.
The DA Eilidh Robertson said at the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had done his graves on the computer, but he claimed he did so to act as a police officer, so that he could scare the pedofils.
Hogg was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg said that his purpose was to mislead the pedofils.
He said he had disturbing thoughts when he was drinking, and he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "After we found the messages on the phone, a girl screamed at her mother, she was shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was interrogated.
The girl told me the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls much younger than themselves.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road recognised the charges of holding inappropriate children's images last June last year. Hogg broke his liberty against guarantees this year on 25 January and failed to come to court on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed in the register of sexual offences, as it may be considered that the offence had no significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the order to October for the background reports of social work.
Hogg was released against the guarantees in this case, but was held in prison on other grounds of inquiry.
Hogg was already added to the sexual criminal record before the day of the judgment was declared.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Mugabe, the oldest head of state in Africa, fell earlier this year in the stairs leading to the speakers.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
The Parliament's openings also undermined the arguments of the opposition party's legislators that they have received anonymous threats of killing in which they are warned that they should be bubbled to Mugabe during his speech.
During the last month, the representatives of the European Parliament buckled and interrupted the speech of the President in Parliament on the state's situation, which held the same speech on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Bishop Innocent Gonese stated that seven opposition politicians received text messages in which they are urged not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"Viesti has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the immunity area.
According to the party's shooter, the party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of reorganisation and savings of business services.
HP is later divided into two stock companies this year and distinguishes computer and printer business more quickly from growing business equipment and service activities.
According to HP's release, the company records a single cost of $2.7 billion on the arrangements from the fourth quarter.
"Restructuring will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," explained the Executive Director Meg Whitman of HP, leading the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"Our company is better than ever, and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company focuses on supplying unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
The company created by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s at the University of Stanford is now divided into two divisions.
Massive reorganisations have been carried out in HP when traditional desktop computers are switched to mobile devices.
The changes of the world's second largest computer manufacturer and the largest technology company in the United States are the newest move in the field that believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the wounded Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb encountered.
Wenger has also stressed Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the following four British country team games, which is clearly unambiguous, knowing the history of a man's participation in European championship competitions.
The biggest problem of the last problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after the last season and appeared to have returned to its former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
"Luu didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field during the period.
This also has to be seen as unpleasant regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different problems since Wilshere debütated six years ago.
He also played at Arsenal's rows only in 65, 157 of the league match during the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six teams have been one of the most injured teams.
Wenger accepts the possible witch circle, but Arsenal believes that last year's improved injury statistics will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes the return after the injury can be associated with a vulnerable period when the body must be strengthened and the competition powers applied for," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope that he will balance his body. I believe in it, and it will keep his career in the way he deserves."
Arsenal starts his work on the Masters' League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team meets Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes to the composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probable starters.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite successor of the F Group, Maximir Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible during 41 games.
The stadium was shaking on Tuesday night when the earth was sparking with a strength of 3.2 Richter scales.
The earthquake was in the tenth Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons of the last season after he has been inclined to Monaco, and he is also still motivated by a distant hope of trusting the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal hasn't hit this title yet.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines in the absence of other series, which is of consideration, especially when considering the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics for young men are at the highest age of 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 25 in Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is faced with the problem by announced for 2015 by men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In the recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, the potential for improvement in depressive symptoms is better if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the likelihood of unintended persons was half-probability if they had people who had no mental health problems around them.
But everything is based on friendship relationships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and societal status associated with the profound success from the outside, all focus on our inner values and the need for personal growth and friendship, and the internal values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
Recently, a millionaire in the video game found that money could not actually buy happiness.
The fineness of the Frendie was that the series turned the focus on its head.
Not one of the characters in the series was defined by the profession but by the personality. This was seen in friendship relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humorously pretending to be hugging or watching football on their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often miss Rachel, and it was clear that the men were able to match this, even though they were not refraining from knowing them fully.
One volunteer explained to me this way: “When I hear people who are depressed and who think about suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest responses of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to cope is strong. The person is easily considered weak if he speaks about their problems."
"Frendit is one of the series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help out of despair at a moment of despair, but long-term support is available from the closest of friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the stages of the series have been brought to life. So if you are taking part in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to the Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a relationship of friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in making a goal in his Masters' liiga debyy and helped the PSG to hit the Swedish team on the Tuesday of Malmö.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were attacked when Paris Saint-Germain started his work in the Masters League by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game was played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of French champions in the immediate hand. However, the PSG broke a number of goal points before they finally were able to add to their leadership: Cavani painting when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. The PSG does not seek only a post in the drop games, but also wants to improve its position for the quarters in the remaining three matches.
Even though SPG picked up the points, the match was not a perfect show for the Laurent Blanc team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal point and the man was replaced when he had his former home company, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or visitors in the Champions' League, so the win between 2 and 0 and the good choices will give a good basis, even though we still have a devastating season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty and able to do it, but we were not able to do one or two extra paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injuries were injured. On the weekend, the team had to be satisfied with the 2-2 in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine Platform moved from Manchester United to the PSG lines was appointed the PSG Soldier, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved that he was worthy of the name when he threw the ball out of Marco Verratt's feed over Malmö's defence and then hit the exact hit on the back corner of Johan Wiland.
But those who were expecting the PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marshaled to the field nine international players since the start of the five-man defenses and the team playing the two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shooting went a little past Kevin Trapp's goal backwards in 34 minutes. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG fell into a negligible feeding and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five targets only in the first half of time, and immediately at the beginning of the second half of the time Ibrahimovic kicked the goal for the potatoes of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed her fingernails in the bait game, and from Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria shot a rotation kick over Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of Cavan, and the six-gathering uruguayman shot the full beat when Ibrahimovic gave him a left squadron from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's circle ended on the other end, and only the Wiland's top fight to shoot David Luiz from the nearest distance was kept under control, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz from the switching bench was abandoned at the end of the yards.
Malmön luoded Åge Hareide afterwards, that PSG was of its own. "We played the game of the previous Masters' League in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
The carnivals aren't enough.
Hats for the couples.
This was a top match for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock.
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was tested by the prices of raw materials, collected USD 2.5 billion in midweek shareholding as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he sold new shares about GBP 1.6 billion in order to reduce debts.
The market value of the company fell by 57 per cent this year, and the company is wreckling with the price drop in raw materials when the decline in the Chinese economy is damaging demand and burdening the markets.

Concerning the continuation of the Chinese economy, the price of iron malt has fallen half, while the decrease in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 % and 40 %.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House Communication confirms that the Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on September 25th. This is a retreat visit to President Barack Obama after visiting Beijing last November.
After the bilateral discussions between the Heads of State, the President of the United States and the President's wife, Michelle Obama, will organise dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for the honor of a state visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China in a wide range of international, regional and bilateral issues which are interested in both sides of China, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on topics that are disagreed", says the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was first reported in February and is expected to visit several U.S. leaders in Seattle. From Seattle, the president's journey would take place first in Washington and then to New York to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about the alleged cyber spying in China and the increased efforts of the country in the waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is undermining the diversity of filming.
Matt Damon spoke with Effie Brown, African-American, and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, explaining how important it was to take into account the different views of the selected manuscript for the dark head of the project.
"The money is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the programme," Damon said.
Brown was stabbed and injured about the argument. "Oh, that's right," she said, "Oh, that's right," she said, "Oh, that's the one in Mars," after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown had met with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at first.
"The only dark character is a prostitute who's having sex with his white pimp."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film, and Damon responded rudely that the choice of the twin could lead to the unwanted outcome.
When the debate was presented on television, the social media exploded on Damon's devastating comments.
The Twitter user Mr.Pooni expressed his anger in the scene by saying, "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark person to explain what diversity is, is so white to make it hurt."
The sign was divided over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the gender representation of human races in the media has the first topics of speech.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, died of a white police bullet in 2014. Black Lives Matter received support through the country.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the store in the presentation of the year's album candidates at the Grammy gala.
"Albumes still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the life of dark men, the albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published the opinion in response to the question of whether this group should be characterised as a group of hatreds.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," said the leader of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media mogules that have been invited to the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not known if Damon answered the call yes.
In the American Ninja Warrior series, the first winner
The professional climber and the dish collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and paid out a million dollars to win.
In the seventh period just ended in the TV series, all the tasks assigned were examined for the first time.
During the last part of the season, Caldiero and the photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the final mission, men had to pain 23 metres of rope up to 30 seconds.
He was the first competitor to perform the fourth phase of the American Ninja Warrior race, but Caldiero completed the mission three seconds earlier and became the winner.
Caldiero told E!News that after a tight fight, they're still in shock after catching a million dollars of pot.
"The winning amount is incredible, because I never earned more than $10,000 a year," he said at the E! interview on his payoff.
"Something, I can't even imagine what comes from this, the future is completely open."
The corresponding producer Kent Weed talked to the The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten will not be rewarded, even though he was the first competitor who has solved all the tasks.
"The rules say it's the fastest to win the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest to win," Weed explained.
"The prize of money is, of course, great and transforms life, but also Britten gets satisfaction from his accomplishment.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and talk about it any more.
He's just satisfied with his performance.
He has received a great deal of praise from the fans.
Britten is a great guy to whom the family is important.
His children and his wives think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he'd rather win Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same way about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth season, the descriptions begin in spring 2016.

"Every victory is nice, whatever it is achieved," said the Tigers bullet Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feedr Alfredo Simon held up when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two pairs, once in the sixth and once in the ninth couple.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 of the good game and allowed three runs.

"I just want to finish the season strong this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a switch gamer in every game, and that's why I want to feed until the sixth turn."
Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs that were his first hit run after the middle of August.
It was Martinez's first three hits the night after he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He hit well," said Ausmus.
"He looks good at his hit exercises and kept a stamp in the game."
On the second turn of the seventh shift, Twins had the best chance to get back to the game.
Central Capt. Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting two nests near the left sideline.
The right chopper Aaron Hicks hit the victim's beating, and Simon took over the second Brian Dozier, who took three direct baits before he replaced the left-hand Blaine Hardy.

Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers had three runs on the first two pairs against the right-handed concoil who had just got back from the list of injured people to the field, and he was on the side for months due to the spinal infection.
"Of course, the beginning was not as I would have hoped. However, as the game progressed, it began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and some good feed in the third shift," Hughes said.
After getting in charge, Hughes gave one nest to the second Ian Kinsler in the first shift.
The real chopper J.D. Martinez's free fight brought Victor Martinez's first run to the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube broke when the team had players on the nest.
The third Nick Castellanos hit one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned while he tried to move on to the third.
Tigers added to his command in the second couple, and the kidnapper James McCann survived the hit on the second nest and Anthony Gose's first nest, when the situation was between 3 and 0.
"A massive hit," commented Twins Coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but the hit hit the right place."
The feed shift was Hughes, who fed the third unpointed shift, after which he was switched to A.J. Achter for his right-hand replacement.
Hughes had three runs, six hits, a free soup and four straight passes.
Note: Anibal Sanchez, the right-hand hitter of Tigers, wasn't involved in the assembly because of the retardation of the hitchair.
Dr. James Andrews is investigating the shoulder, who cut Sanchez into the shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons due to the relapse of the shoulder since mid-August, and he was meant to be involved on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, the left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and is involved in the opening meeting against Twins.
Norris has received 1 to 1 in four games since he was replaced by a left-handed hitter on 30 July David Pricee.
He's been gone from the assembly since August 20th because of the retardation of the abdominal muscle.
Tigers and Twins will decide their three-game series on Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running mean: 4,43) receives Ervin Santana (5-4, running centre: 4,73) of the right-hand user of Minnesota.
