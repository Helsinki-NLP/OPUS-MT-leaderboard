When an English-speaking person sees that a foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand something he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder as if he was deaf. At no point does he realize that his choice of words could be complicated, or that his expression could be easily misunderstood by a foreigner, and that he could make it easier to say it in other words. As a result, not only does a person still not understand what he said, but also becomes irritated about being considered a deaf person.
