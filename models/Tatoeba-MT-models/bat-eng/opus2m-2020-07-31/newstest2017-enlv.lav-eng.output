A 28-year-old chef found dead at the San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who would hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
The figure found on Wednesday at the Westfield supermarket was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the Medical Bureau of the San Francisco Courts.
The San Francisco police declared that his death was a murder and that investigations are under way.
Brother of the victim Luis Galicia tells San Francisco for ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dream restaurant Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we will miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we will think with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that at first Frank had spent the night in the hostels, but lately life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radiostation KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who wants to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always helped his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Louis Galicia
He never wanted to engage in a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"Considering all that went wrong in the world, he was like an untreated diamond that day by day shined brightly," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call SFPD Information Phone 415-575-445-444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of new doctors call on their trade unions to open protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The Committee of Young Doctors of the Association of British Medicine (LMA) (JAC) intends to ask the Board to support the wider protests in early September.
According to the JAK, the ministers have not been able to dispel the doubts about the contract.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message published on Thursday evening on Twitter, Elena Makkorta, a member of the JAK Council, points out that the government continues to keep silent on this issue and that therefore the offer of the Treaty has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAC vote, the proposal for a treaty had been completely rejected and a decision had been made to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government silence, the JAC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the drafting of new agreements, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors have participated in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS history.
Following the vote rejecting the contractual terms proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, Dr Johan Malawana, representative of the new doctors of the LMA, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, informed that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: An Outlying Alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to rock and announce the end of the eight-month-long word and economic sanctions war.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg Castle, it seemed that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
But both of them were rocked.
Vladimir Putin’s smile seemed to have been compositional and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Ranger Tajjip Erdogan described Putin at least five times as his "Dear friend", telling us an overview of the meeting.
I'm out of number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s swaying cold shows that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the landing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted with a sharp response.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dunny in the back of Moscow.
The deal was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government - controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
It suddenly seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations that the Erdogan family itself profited from the illicit trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it himself, of course.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was just because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara from the peace settlement is obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after a failed coup last month, where he was tried to fall.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused considerable damage, especially the charter ban, which usually provides for the influx of millions of Russian tourists in Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies also breathe lightly when scheduled flights are renewed.
They are looking forward to a summer holiday in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the country's TV forecasts a drop in fruit and vegetable prices, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes, "tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West about their weak reaction to the coup attempt.
All of this can also be seen with the ongoing negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, which are willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government following the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in the fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as an analyst called it, the 'remote alliance', and the two countries that feel disfellowshipped from the West, joined forces.
However, despite publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carrier of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, the two Presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey was targeted to avoid the issues of disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries can find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of open hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey hit the Russian battle plane, the situation has improved, as at least the two leaders have resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB brand will in future have a supporting role to play, as announced by the bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and it needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, the Brand Strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Redby and ending with the Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also be noted.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees along Invernesshire.
He told BBC to the Scottish channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we become more a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focussing on the needs of our clients rather than our own needs, we have obviously made great changes.
We can revitalise these brands once again, so I think this is the right time now.
Frankie Detori wins 3000, winning first place in the Newmarket with Horse Predition
The detectors recregate the champagne, winning their 3000th victory twice by finalizing the first race in the New Market.
Friday jockey Franky Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, gaining the first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in this race, which took place in his hometown by riding with Predition, trained by John Gosden.
A 45 - year - old Italian is the sixth jockey, who has achieved such a result in a horse sprint race.
He's joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery and Willie Karson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not a Royal Ascott, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel happy and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predition are welcomed with applause and gems.
Two jockeys have reached this record in a race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the 20th-time champion, Sir Antonio McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning over 4300 victories.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derby winner, won 4493 victories during his career.
Frankie is one of today’s best jockeys and is not surprising that he has achieved success that only a few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactic sense separates him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma years attract fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie that he had already won 6,000 without just weekends and big races.
Seriously speaking, however, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He is a happy man who works well in the British race, and he is also an outstanding jockey.
Frank Detor noted this achievement with his brand - flying jump.
From finish at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been a British horse racing face for 20 years.
This has been an adventure complete path.
He has won countless big races, including the famous "Big Seventh" in Asko in 1996, and has experienced plane accidents and disqualifications about the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time – Detori has previously said that he would like to continue to take part in the race until at least 50 years of age.
Putin, President of Russia, releases Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been among Putin’s closest people for many years.
The 63-year-old politician is now appointed special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the position of Head of Administration of the Russian President", without giving a reason.
He is responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population.
The 44-year-old Wino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later led the President's Protocol and government staff administration.
After being appointed, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as the President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivanov wanted to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be his alternate.
Are smiles strong?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he worked at the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia in this capacity.
At a state television session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cameras, this explanation rarely convinces us, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that a man, who was considered to be a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this difficult post, you could even say, the problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov took on the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov the number of five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered as a potential candidate for the position of President of Russia, as the reelection of Putin for the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then, a close associate of Putin - Dmitri Medvedev - became president.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to office three and a half years later.
The Development of Fishing in a Garden in Banfa
A man from Banfas asks for help to find out what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banfas.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels that have gone away with a water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 50 feet [500 m] from the sea, made a video of fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimetres of fish came into his garden.
Quinosphere Crossing: The bridge is now connected to the Faif.
Currently, a GBP 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferia cross and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the bridge is nearing its completion.
The structure of the Fifha Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
Currently, a GBP 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The economic secretary, Kate Brown, had come to the building site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferian bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only these parts use more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge to the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been constructed and the last section that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first bridge is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we left to connect the northern section of the road with the part of the land, or viaduct.
This was done by moving a part of the northway viaduct 700 mm south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
It is huge, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn by about 3%.
Delicious, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimetres.
Happily, everything went well.
Simon Bailes acquires gold in the exercise of women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bailes doesn't worry about this.
Dynamic jumps.
Easily perform exercises on the beam.
Unsatisfactory on the floor.
It's perfectly perfect.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, an 19 - year - old American gymmer won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to the results of the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismane and the results of the bronze medal winner Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athletes Simon Bailes performed exercises on the individual multi-flying finals for women in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailes became the fourth American in a row who won the title of a multi-fighter champion and the fifth best gymnastics, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best gymnastics of his or her generation and perhaps the best in his or her history.
When the final result was announced, she broke out in tears, because the long way to go was over.
This achievement ranks him next to such unparalleled athletes as Michael Phelp, who raised his sports on a different level.
Bailes has dominated her sports for the last three years, acquiring 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold medals, carrying out such outstanding, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that in 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called him "the best gymnastics she ever saw".
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test of having to cope with expectations over other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailes (left) and Alija Raismane are surrounded by after respectively gold and silver medal in the individual multi-war finals for women in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal Bailes got on Tuesday, making a special selection of coordinators Marta Karolji fare farewell party.
Although Bailes claims that in her long way to the tops of glory, it was not true.
Part of her performance in free movements, which includes her special acrobatics transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by the mother of Amy Burman on a tour to a gym where Būrmane terniens took place has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost her fight since the summer of 2013 and the series of wins can continue as long as Bailes wants it.
Even though Mustafin had a little leadership over two rotations, it was only an illusion.
Balance log and free movement - part of the race, where Bailes will defend her champion title, is still just ahead.
She came forward with a result of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the lead with a result of 15,933 in free movements
Raismane gave her a gentle hug while waiting for results that were only formality and her tears of joy when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook came true.
The result of the rumour was a little revenge for four - year - old events, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for a bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, who is called Grandma, came up with a persuasive leadership.
After her performance in free movements, which dispelled her doubts about her return, she could dedicate herself to a crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bailes' virtual Twitter record r, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
Mahai Brown, 6 years old, survives a fire in Philadelphia.
The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that this is already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
Grandparents of the child confirmed that it was Mahaeus Brown to the CBS - Philadelphia news channel.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in a circus, in a foot, in a hand, in a stomach, but was still at the point of consciousness when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the television: "His little body was simply a hole of bullets."
I can't believe that.
The boy is in a critical state in a hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family informs us that he will certainly recover.
He had to start his first class at a local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the town of Germantown.
Three men were shot, two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
The CBS Philadelphia Channel reports that one of the 29 - year - old men is in a critical state, while the other two are in a stable state.
The channel tells that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29 - year - old victim in a critical state.
The other two were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The investigator told the CBS Philadelphia channel that several shooters were likely involved in the fire.
Armour shells belonging to different weapons have been found at the site of the event.
Looks like it's been a long shot.
On both sides of the pedestrian’s side, shells have been found.
"So far it seems that there have been several armed shooters here who have played an active part in the shooting," says Antonio Ginaldi, the police captain of Philadelphia.
Damages have also been caused in several homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and the police have been reported to check the record of surveillance cameras.
The other day, a lost bullet hit a six - year - old girl in her hand while she was playing at her home in the Vestouklin district.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simona, Gabby and Lauria?
I call it the Year Women's Olympic Lighty Team for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three crèches, Simon Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, who are inspired by many new girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismone, who is a Jewish woman and Madison Cociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, African American is the best gymmer.
Last year, Simona and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises by Simon Bailes, Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, the champion of the triple world, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row who has won a gold medal in an individual battle for women.
Her teammate, Alija Raismane, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different during the exercise hours.
Simona, Gabby, and Lauria entered the Olympics as well as Alija and Medisona.
They are "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coaching by Martha Carola.
In fact, gymnastics are expensive sports. Venors are mainly trained in private athletics clubs, and they are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (trends, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs athletes take out all their trainings, and this is a costly and long investment for the families of Lt.
Amy Burman - Simon Bailes coach and Maggie Hainya - Lauria Hernandez coach has trained her athletes since both girls started to work with athletics.
We must provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabija and Lauria with cheaper training opportunities.
I set up my SME organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 city-based trainings for young people (mainly black and Spanish) at no cost or at low cost. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit (my home town) to give local young people the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Lightweight develops strength, flexibility and body co-ordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and ambition for purpose.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
To do this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Medisona for their excellent demonstration of "The Power of Girls", acquiring gold medals of the Olympic Games and encouraging countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer has been rejected, young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on the modification of the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced its plans to conclude the contract, stating that NHS is in a fragile situation and that further delays will only be detrimental to workers and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the working conditions for night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Elena McCourta, representative of the new doctors at BMA, stated that the young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and this does not provide a level playing field for all doctors.
Eight weeks left until the first group of young doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made, because there is not enough time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
It happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop inactivity and cooperate with young doctors.
If he does not, young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were carried out at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to pick up.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on the modification of the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for weekend work by 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
Daniel Mortimers, the Executive Director of the NHS, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase pressure on the burdened workers and worry, create stress and obstacles for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have talked to the Committee of New Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of employees, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine - shows that employers, health education institutions in England and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
A daily dose of 2 pounds may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had heart attack could be treated with the medicine at a rate of 2 pounds per day, as official representatives recommend that they use it for more people and for longer periods.
Anticoagulation medicines Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine has already been prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
It is recommended that NHS represented NICE be used 4 years after a heart attack in order to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that NICE, which is responsible for NHS, is used 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the cardiovascular risk.
Each year, some 140,000 people in England experience heart attacks, and a quarter of them suffer from heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart to form obstructions.
If the obstruction ruptures, it can cause a clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if a clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can enter the bloodstream and block the blood’s access to the brain, causing the heart to attack.
People who have had a heart attack are more at risk of having a heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, a British company that markets Brilique, reduces the risk of developing blood clots.
The new guidelines for NICE, published today, are recommended for use by humans at 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and for another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of Health Technologies at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent repeated heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it.
By recommending treatment with Ticagrelor in advance, we are pleased that we can expand treatment opportunities to thousands of people who benefit from it.
In view of the limited information on efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
A policy culture promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Mayor of the Tayerhamlett city, Lutfur Rahman was dismissed in the context of corruption.
The Government's report reveals that as a result of a political correction culture, large-scale fraud in Muslim communities is turned to eyes.
Former Minister of Government Ser Ēriks Picls criticises the police, election observers and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process, because they "fear to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should allow guards to be placed at electoral stations in order to protect accused voters.
He also recommends that voters should present an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Voters should at present only indicate their name and address.
He even recommended to mark the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He felt that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauning Street after a scandal in connection with the Tauerhamlet city elections.
Last year the special election court decided to abolish the mayor Lutfur Rahman of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities of the mayor.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics against racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman conducted his election campaign with the principle that Muslim believers have a religious duty to vote in favour of him."
About 300 votes were counterfeited or questionable because one person had voted on several occasions.
Also, Sir Eric points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that there was a particularly worrying case of postal fraud, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to clarify the identity of a person.
His report states: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of senior candidates selected by the community, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that regional authorities do not pay attention to these problems due to political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be undermined."
Sir Erik made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with the votes cast by post in order to prevent "voice collection".
The report examined by Teresa May also calls for a closer check of registration in order to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of the voters with special ink in order to avoid double voting.
A systematic check of the nationality of persons to make sure that a person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Forbid political campaigners and activists from voting by post and parliamentary envelopes for postal voting.
Ensure that the police have the authority to designate a guard at the polling station.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Forbid to take pictures in polling districts.
Introduce a requirement to use only English (except Wales) in polling districts.
Reinforce training to ensure that voters go to election boxes on their own.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolis police, who did not understand that there were no accusations in the Taurerhamlet case.
He says: "The Court of Luftur Rahman and his representative for corruption and fraud-related activities only disqualified Luftur Rahman."
He was firmly found guilty of the standard of evidence of criminal law on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient election "six-fix check" of city council voters in the registration districts.
Sir Eric points out: "The court decision made last year is an alarm call.
Our land is known as Parliament's homeland, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the authorities pretend that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.

The commentator at the CBC Olympics apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is 'ending out as a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish in the fourth place 4x200 m free-style booth for women, called indignation storm for CBC viewers.
The Canadian Channel's CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flagged out of the race that stinked alone" and "dead like a pig".
Commentator Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was switched off when 4x200 m of free-style booth for women at the end of the final presentation of their personal opinion .
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentators' team to give his comments to life, said: "This little 14-year-old from China is unable to keep up with it."
"Too long, she went out of the race that stinked just and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the second stage of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers throughout Canada responded immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expression.
Emmet McCharlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead like a pig"???".
Idiot did not realize that they were still in the immediate air.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free style final for women was named "the small fourteen-year-old from China, who does not hold with him."
The criticism of Bairon McDonald quickly came into force because many asked for explanations.
Twitter users could not believe it by hearing the insensitive comments of Bairona McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Pararadi wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and for you we all sound like a racist.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was directing the CBC live, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologise that the comment on the bathing results came to light."
It was a bad choice of words and we regret that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to this comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
Then CBC copied the apologies to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also rapidly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and that they came to the immediate air.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all live viewers and followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairona's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, they were unprofessional and unsuccessful chosen expressions and Bairon deeply regretted the events.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the direct air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In the live broadcast of the CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's free-style race."
I am talking about the performance of a swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to show respect, and I really regret that it happened.
One woman shocks the buyers, and she does not shame the underwear shop.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman started to dress up to wear panties in the middle of the store.
Even though the situation was getting worse, she kept them in place to make sure that they fit her and then took her off by placing her pants back on the shelf of the store.
She continued to look for clothes in the Bolkestone Bouverie Place shopping center store and held four more panties.
Primar store Bouverie Place at the shopping centre in Folkeston – a place where she held her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, was also in the store, who said that the unknown woman, after having put on the underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe in their own eyes.
While standing in the middle of the store, she took the shelf’s underpants, took off her socks and trousers, and put them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just kept them right there.
Everyone watched her take off her pants and apparently she didn't like them, because she just put them back on her shelf.
She put on three more pants until she decided that she did not like any of them and left the store.
She did not seem to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about someone who would buy the clothes that she was wearing.
Miss Davidsson (33 years old) from Kent says, "It's the idea that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by another person and that have not been washed out afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidsson adds: "I assume that after she left the store, the employees of the store took the clothes out of the store's shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has used it and hasn’t washed it out afterwards.
The representative of Primark pointed out that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothes have been removed from store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in the near distance from attackers with a firearm, we spoke to Krav Maga’s chief master from New York City Ron Mizzaki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win the attacker.
When an attacker strikes from the back, the riddle must first turn around to clearly see the attacker and avoid the projection of the shot.
Then the weapon should be grasped between his front hand and his shoulder and hit the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then followed by a blow with a knee around the circus and while the attacker freezes in his pain, take his gun, bounce his face with a gun clip and step away, continuing to turn the gun against him.
If the attacker approaches the front, the situation is similar - to avoid a shot path, to capture the weapon and to bend it in such a way that the evil man cannot shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and a blow must be made on the opponent’s chest and finally take his gun away and step back to focus on him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizzaki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Mags's master, then it's safe to give your money to the robber.
The Vandal family demolishes the social home of Saltash Cornwall and is laid on the street.
The Vandal family has been laid out from residence to terrorize its neighbours, causing damage to a social home of GBP 50 000.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Shon Trebilkoc, have been forced out of property in Salta's Cornwall because several complaints have been made about them.
When they were forced out of property, shocked housing officials found that the property was fully demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was thrown everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now set aside and is likely to live in private property.
Donna Makevo, the home manager in Cornwall, says that there are concerns that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and that she believes that people cannot live.
In the present case, a number of factors must be considered, since in future this property in Cornwall will no longer be of good repute.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically in possession and the police say that their terror was the form of violence, street breakdown with baseball bats, intimidation of locals, drug use, drug sales, and loud humiliation and harassment.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was property, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
In several demolished rooms of the house, dumped waste was found.
There are also several floor boards in a home where drugs can be sold in the past.
The neighbors say that they have been on the street regularly and have always been called police.
They were forced by the Cornwall Housing Service to withdraw from the house on a voluntary basis for 11 weeks.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be abandoned because their life was an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now, when they're finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the neighbourhood protection service in Cornwall, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
In the home-growing garden, various old and unusable objects were found.
He also said, "It is a pity that tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behaviour, because putting out of the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard to see in their behaviour.
I appreciate the work of my entire team, the police in Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who were courageous and worked with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying out.
Service workers will now have to clean up the pile of waste left in the house.
In 2014, the police house was searched and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, pounds, accessories and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeledone was only found guilty of class B drugs for distribution purposes.
She insisted that the money was intended for her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being set aside, it became known that they currently rent some private property in Plymouth.
On many walls of the house, graffiti were drawn.
The police tell us that they will continue to send tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Krov, the police representative of Devon and Cornwall, points out that this setting-up is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and have no consequences."
The police in Devon and Kronvola are not acceptable to criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Ready to spend can give impetus to the economy.

Cannes mayor banned the burkin swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Cannes has banned the use of burkini swimsuits on its beaches, almost completely covering the body of the woman and very similar to the hydrosuit, announced on Thursday by local officials.
Cannes Mayor David Linar has signed a decree that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal's outfit, which externally shows religious affiliation at a time when France and cult sites are the object of terrorist attacks, can pose a risk of public order (crowding, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented," the order states.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about extraterrestrial clothing related to trust in terrorist movements that war with us," explained the municipal communal director Thierry Migul.
He added that the burkin swimsuits on the Cannes beaches have not been seen since July 28, when the right member of the Central Party "Republikaņi" Linar signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the Aquapark in Marseilles abolished a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed burkins in swimming suits, as the politicians of both the right and the left expressed their indignation for such an event.
In France, it is prohibited to wear female Muslim headgear covering the face, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, the terrorists in the nearby resort town of Nice, under the responsibility of the "Islamic State" Group, killed 85 people.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn confidence in the "Islamic State" brutally murdered the priests in the church in the northwest of France.
Jysk's tumour turnover by 5% last year
Last year, the retailer of household goods SIA "Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk") had a tumour turnover of 5%, reaching 23.66 million euros, as shown by "Firmas.lv" information.
The turnover of the company in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The company's profits also increased slightly - from 781 235 euros in 2014 to 785 896 euros last year.
According to the management report, last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, Kurzeme Prospect.
This year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profits.
In the meantime, it is recommended that the profits made last year be left undistributed.
"Jysk" is an international network of shops that offers goods for home improvement.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. was established in 2001.
The company's share capital is EUR 3 500 264.
The company is owned by Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC, a company established in Iceland.

The festival "Cubaan" started at Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, in the evening of Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - "Kubanas" will take place there until Sunday night.
At first night, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but from the program was missing, American panks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the following festival days, famous names - Guano Apes and Garbage, drummer of the pankrok legend Ramones Marky Ramone with Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, Brutto & Lyapis with the leader of the Belarusian pankrok at the forefront of Sergey Mihalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabdze, Ukrainians Vopli Vidoplyasova and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it was a financial failure and huge loss, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a spirit to the title, and included a Latvian group in the programme ( Friday evening 19:15 on the stage dunes "All Day Long") and announced that the festival has now become "closer and acquired a local color next to the symbols of Riga such as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is too early to reason, because the festival has only run, but, as the "Delfi Entertainment" observed on the first night, at least for the time being huge crowds of people have failed and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British Track Cycling Team twice improves the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British track team corrected the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the sprint race for men.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in their qualification, but the first round of the competition was re-ignited by the New Zealanders.
A British team met New Zealand at the end of Spring, and the British took over the title of the Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
The final team of the UK won with a score of 42,440 seconds, overcoming the New Zealands by 0,102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team overcame Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of the women's drive: the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgale was born.
Zemgale proclaimed the state of Latvia, but the widely described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period were left in Karls Ulmanis' shadow.
None of our countrymen have ever defended democracy and the rule of law such as Zemgale, written in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgale ten years ago by Arnolds Auziņš.
In a conversation with the "Delfi" portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the rare politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of them, they're always very right.
He taught nothing, today it could be like Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was one who was close to the people," says Auziņš.
Modern politicians do not know the history, they referred to Kārlis Ulmani as good leaders, but rarely anyone knows how disgusting he was.
In government sittings, the only person to whom he was not yelled was General Balodis.
Even if he was kind and smiling in pictures, by nature he was hysterical.
"The sign with its sense of humor and democracy has exactly the opposite effect," says Auziņš.
Professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Strangs, in conversation with "Delfi", agrees with the report's assessment of Zemgale as a calm and balanced stateman.
He also noted that Zemgale had expressed respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
"At that time, it was not a common practice, after the Zemgale Presidency, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and balanced person who had to be mentioned as president for a long time.
He himself didn't want it, he just didn't want it.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but thought that the President should understand that.
"In the course of the presidentship, the basics of the French language were learned," explained Stranga.
Zemgale did not allow himself to be reassigned to candidates, but he did not like the very high positions.
In any case, he is a very respected person in the history of Latvia, already before he entered the President's Palace there was a serious position - he was a very demanding notary.
Zemgale also led the famous Zemgale cashier at Suvorova Street 3, where a society of savings and savings publishers was located, where the state of Latvia was practically formed in government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
There was no great lover of Ulmanis, but he was not publicly opposed either.
"In private conversations, though, it has sometimes been said that the actions of Ulmanis do not embarrass him," says Stranga.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of injustice or corruption.
How does Zemgall remember today?
Unfortunately, for a large part he is associated only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, beliefs were central.
"There were no major shocks in her time, i.e. he could be associated with such a real stable presidency," Strang says.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgale, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's state visit to Sweden was also held, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition for Latvia in the neighbouring country and integration into the Nordic Democratic Nations family.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often face the fact that parents view the appearance of anger, anger, or anger as wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, Econet says psychologist Jekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a little talk about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When adults are angry, we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger: express, suppress, hide, keep it in ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can do so in our anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to shout anger!), enter the shower, snooze with a cuff in the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression to others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
When children find anger, they do not understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool," "Bad mom, "I don't see you", "I won't make friends with you" and very rarely when you can say, "I'm angry at you."
Children live literally, they are completely present right here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly showing their feelings, and are often also captured by different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent a child from showing feelings, including anger, from being ashamed of it and not looking, but on the contrary - from helping the child.
Do you need a break in the relationship?
A long working day, in which everything has not gone the way you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to "disconnect" from all over the world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to put on relationships for a moment and breathe out a little bit?
Or does this indicate that each of the partners is on its own way?
The gentlemen share their opinions in different ages.
John (23) is short and succinct: "In my opinion, if there is a need for a person in a relationship, then don't be with the real man."
In the meantime, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that a partner is beginning to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then it's definitely the time when you should explore other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or especially don't think about him, or don't even want to see him at all.
So the answer is, yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important the other half is.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, one person should be kept in a relationship on a daily basis, because if you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to bother with each other, especially if there is nothing else to talk about, just what you have done in the day.
My personal experience leads me to think so, so I have never had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that it is better elsewhere or at the other side - then why is this woman you are with deserved to think that there is not enough good here and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, therefore, a little condemnation of those who don't have." says Edmunds (46).
Karl (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment to breathe.
You can't watch each other in the eyes of each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice in the unfailing love.
Get out of here!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
It's all time.
Of course, even for a friend or wife, if both have a balance between family life and the rest of the world, they can live up to the edge of the tomb.
That's it.
Mārtiņš (27) says, "It's hard to say, we need to or do not, we can or must not take a break, but one thing is clear: there's nothing in our relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is raised, then it must be taken into account that there will be some change in the near future - either on the right or on the bad side, it depends on itself.
I thought while you're still young and crazy, while you need a break - even all the time, but when everything remains serious and relationships go into a completely different phase, there can't be any talk about recreation.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't endure each other's society now, and once again you need to take a breath, then what will happen when you're retired, who will comment on how passing cats do nothing or argue about on what day the garden should be better covered," says Kristaps (19).
All the words of the lords have been changed.
With its thrilling and thrilling personality, Rozentāls was the first to awaken the interest of the Latvian people in the fine arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which as such will remain unforgettable for life," said Roman Suta as the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
In 2016, when opening the old master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is also clear – Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospectation in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall honors painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose 100th birthday on the international scale is included in the UNESCO Festival calendar.
The retrospective exhibition, with more than 150 works, is one of the main events of Janis Rozentāls' anniversary annual programme.
The selection of works of art is mainly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activities, stylistic variability and the variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Aksele Gallena-Callela Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Museum of Tukums and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the century is revitalized by the presence of photographs, and the mobile application of the exhibition reveals a separate work of art, intertwining with photographs taken by the painter and his own camera for the purposes of his creation.
In turn, the Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after a Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art, presents at the same time small informative travelling exhibitions "With a view in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exposition with a content presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the "Virk" gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to returning to the TopGear show.
Mets Leblankas, the head of the television "TopGear" ("Gas in the floor!"), said that he was eager to return to the car show in the second season, but admitted that he did not know what would happen in the future.
So far, there is nothing officially happening.
"If it happens, the BBC will announce it," Leblank discovered in his conversation with TV critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gase in the Floor!" arose in July when Leblanka's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the program.
After leaving Evans admitted that Leblankas and "Gaze on the floor!" were "how they were created for each other."
Evans describes the star of the former series Friends as a "real and good man", thus denying the rumors that the friendship of both of them has been broken during the filming.
When he asked what he liked most in the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco, and Ireland.
The TV BBC tells us that the show is not planned to replace Evansa in the new 24th season.
Kalvins: Meldonija could already be removed from the list of prohibited substances for athletes this year.
It is expected that the meldonium of medicinal product Mildronate produced in Latvia could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year; on Friday morning, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician Ivars Kalvins, said in the LNT programme for 900 seconds.
He told me that he was going to Canada in September to discuss the question with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronate would be removed from the "black list" already this year.

In some places, it's going to get cooler.
On Friday also in some places short-term rains are expected and another degree will be cooler, the agency LETA learned about the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
There is a possibility that thunder might be carried out at places.
According to forecasts, rain is mostly expected in Kurzeme and the northern Vidzeme.

In his interpretation, the U.S. business scenes have gained the glanty of a perversely sophisticated photo session and the inconvenientness of the horror film.
Basically - a very provocative work on the balance between subtlety and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the line between the European art-house film and the area of Hollywood's genre.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the main role highlights the question whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from consumer society's limpness and values) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist of six children, after her wife's death, is confronted with questions about the accuracy of choices and the true values.
A moving, intelligent film by Met Ross, this year won the Cannes Festival Award for Regime.
Of course, sharks only do this as an attack on beautiful girls - in the jaws it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, represented by Blake Livley.
The work has demanded a great heroism from her.
This survival soul can be compared to James Franco's actuary demonstration in a movie 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds' game in a movie Approx live.
Perhaps there is also the main role of the sculptor Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the illustration of the creative contemporaneous and almost family values to the imagination of Hollywood scripts seem to have been created only by a rather desperate fantasy.
The Islamic state in Syria has destroyed 2 000 civilians.
As a result, he is responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.
"We didn't shoot them because they took civilians with us when they fled to Gerabulus," said the press representative of the Kurd Manbiza Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurd-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), which is a U.S.-supported Courde-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbyzh has been released from the jihadist.
The Islamic country took Menbiza in 2014.
As early as last week, the majority of the "Islamic State" fighters were driven away from Menbige, but the majority held up and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city taking captives with them.
Islamics are going to Gerabulus, on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), based in London, also reported that the Islamic State had robbed about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists had robbed cars of the city’s population, forced people to jump into them, and then took them to Gerabulus.
In the past, Islamic national fighters have also been the subject of mass abductions.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir az Zora in the east of Syria.
Later, Islamists released about 270 of the prisoners.
There are no known numbers of Islamic national fighters who have fled from Menbige.
Other information: Member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Information collected by the SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the Menbyz battle.
Other information: Member of the Taliban Supreme Council as at June 2011.
Kolegova refuses to stand as the head of the SRS.
Inga Kolegova, Head of State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of State Revenue Service (VID), LETA informed the agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that her candidacy has been enhanced by the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussions seem to relate to the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"This is not acceptable to me too", emphasizes already been the applicant for the office of the head of the SRS.
If her candidacy were approved in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and that it would not allow for the full work and implementation of the necessary changes in the SRS, with the support of the entire government.
Without it, it would not be possible to do a full job, concludes Kolegova.
"I have stressed to the public that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is too politicised," the official explains.
"Thank you for the trust and support shown to me, it is the experience that I value as a benefit," writes Koļegova in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
Unity on Wednesday stated that during the meeting with Kolegova there were "significant contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and information on dividends costs of SIA Pallogs was available in public registers, because the decisions of the participants' meetings are not to distribute profits.
Currently, Deputy Director General Dace Pelek is in charge of the functions of the head of the SRS.
In Livani, the police are involved in the rescue of two young children left unattended, informs the State Police Regional Authority.
News of unattended wheelchairs with infants received on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were in Livani near the building of the former store.
Both little girls were put in the hands of medical practitioners for help.
There was also a bag with paperwork and a mobile phone in the trolley.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers cleared the possible location of their parents and went there.
When the woman’s civil husband arrived at home, the police found out that she was sleeping because she was under the influence of alcohol.
After the first information on the evening of the previous day, in 1992, the woman who was born visited her friend, who was drinking alcohol.
When she went home after a joint sitting, she decided to leave her children at the shop under unknown circumstances.
The police immediately reported the events to the orphan court, which will also determine the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the SAO regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the development of the project Infrastructure on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, and the Diena.lv portal informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned for the next board meeting of the Freeport of Riga Freeport.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the SAC, when preparing the necessary documentation for implementation of the recommendations, Riga Freeport Authority also led the conclusions and recommendations of the legal and operational audit of the Riga Freeport Authority carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the future phase of the project management.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the VK on the feasibility of implementing the project on the Russian island, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all planned construction works within the framework of the project have been completed in full within the specified time limits and in the planned amount.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the GC and also the GC that the main objective of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all recommendations of the GC regarding project management and monitoring issues," said Sanita Kaire, project manager of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project goal was supplemented by the main planned actions of the parties concerned and the time limits for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools of the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project's objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing control over the duration of activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Freeport of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining the areas of project management and specifying the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure has been developed to increase the capacity of the project, reflecting the planned structure, qualification and functions of the project management team.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the project, which, in addition to the parties set out in the project action plan, defines the parties interested in the project’s successful completion, the principles, methods and periodicity of information exchange.
However, in order to improve control over the use of funds, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of a procurement and the rule of law will need to be more detailed in the future.
Within the framework of the project, a port infrastructure meeting world standards has been constructed in the Russian island – four new deep-water ports, rail ports, as well as engineering communications.
The constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the last year, with savings of EUR 10.6 million in the funding allocated to it.
In Slovakia security at airports has been enhanced due to the risks.
After receiving a non-specific threat, Slovakia increased security measures at several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", the news agency AFP was told by a press representative of the Slovak Ministry of the Interior on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we received," he added.
On 16 September, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia, with the participation of all block countries except Great Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia shall hold the Presidency of the EU by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the border of former East Germany under the Communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain undisputed.
According to the data presented to the public on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 the Communist authorities of Western Allied Areas and later West Germany killed 1841 people who tried to escape their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and has been adjusting the number of victims on a regular basis.
11 more deaths have been added to the list this year, including among the victims a six-year-old boy drowned trying to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet army deserters.
"The final amount of harm caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says the museum's director Aleksandra Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape the Communist-controlled state are cared for and not disappeared," stressed in the statement distributed by Hildebrande.
Other researchers, however, have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is unconvincing", Johens Stat, an expert in East German history of the Free University of Berlin claims in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border and has so far only managed to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that just off the Berlin Wall, the Communists killed 138 people.
In view of those people who died trying to escape from the Baltic Sea or to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the State believes that the number of victims could reach about 1,000.
However, this remains well below 1841.
One reason for the different types of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie's museum also lists all cases of suicide of East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age died of a heart attack after the contraction of border control," says Hildebrande.
But Stath is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their experiences and those whose death was caused by long waiting time on a bus near the border.
Regardless of this, the record of victims is not easy, because the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to publish documents in various scattered archives, according to the State.
However, the State Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
Mr. President of the LPF, Mr. Rio, went to the coach's accreditation; that's a surprise.
In recent days, the well-known President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Mr.
On Wednesday, a great deal of dawn arose from the statements made by the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova trainer German Jakubovsky, who discovered that the last moment in Rio de Janeiro had decided to go to Sir while the trainer had to stay home.
Initially, swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Daves Collins were approved on the list, as well as the President of the Federation, Mr.
The Latvian Bathing Federation applied for five participants for the Olympics, and even before departure Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans will be and will be looking for tickets.
"However, he was obviously not present for objective reasons," said Mr.
At the federation's request, Uvja's coach took care of her.
Mr President, who himself is a member of the LOC Executive Committee, strongly criticised the operation of the LOC, and led the organisation supervising Olympic sports to blame.
In my view, it is unethical for five persons to be approved by the LOK Executive Committee and one of them not to be removed.
"I don't know why it was not enough for the Swimming Federation to have a place," Mr.Mr. said that the work of the Federation and their presidents has not been appreciated in society, reminding us that the presidents of the Federation do not receive wages.
He also criticised Jakubovskis himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Sir, he couldn't tell us why he had a coach's accreditation in the Olympics, which was probably supposed to come to Jakubovskis.
"I was nominated as the president of the Federation "team guideer", but for unknown reasons I received coach accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere in."
The situation changed daily, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment I thought German would be because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribokov, she had a face-to-face conversation with Pone and had tears in the eyes of the swimmer, but the President of LPF himself said that it was a daily conversation with a desire to mind the athletes before the start.
Mr President reminded me that the LPF oversees five sports that are in the Olympic programme, and four of them provide training for children in Latvia as well.
The President of the Federation said that the issues of glide also matter in Latvia, and he also talked about such programmes while in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that the World Cup stage could take place in 2018 in Latvia.
Location in Rio is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programmes.
600,000 salmon pups will enter the river.
During the Latvenergo AS fish stock recovery program this week, more than 600 000 annual salmon and Thai juveniles grown in the fish farms of the Scientific Institutes Bior Tomes and Doles are being introduced in the River Daugava near Mangalsala.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue for the coming months - each year 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In spring and early summer 2016, pike and marine larvae will be released, in June - sīgas, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zandartes and vimbs.
The production director of Latvenergo, Maris Kuņickis, said that the concern about the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"Every activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out the production and introduction of young fish in the Daugava basin, as well as other activities," Kunickis pointed out.
This year, more than 600 000 annual salmon and thyme juveniles will be introduced into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, the juveniles have been marked before entering, cutting off the fat.
Today, there are 25 000 salmon pups with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the composition and quantity of scientifically-based species in the Daugava and its water bodies, the introduction of juveniles and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and its water bodies according to the laws and regulations is carried out by Bior based on the loss of fish resources due to Latvenergo's economic activity and by providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environment Service, on the other hand, decides on the amount and type of compensation on the basis of the said expertise.
The annual compensatory amount of Latvenergo in the recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We For Fish", has placed 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikškile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the Society to promote natural fish spawning is an initiative supported by Latvenergo in the framework of the fish recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.
The festival "Sansusis concert hall" features a courtyard, a forest, a curl.
The bed in the tent, eats like a restaurant, walks in kedos and listen to the investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet nature of peace, such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which already invites you to the town of Akņiste for the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sosēja - no longer existing villages - in the courtyard of the former parish house, next to the forests and axes.
During three days - from 12 to 14 August - five stages can be combined with the carefree pleasure of nature and academic music.
Here comes theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, find new audiences in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but only a few minutes to smile in the face and lightness.
"Please don't look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansusi can only be taken by spending all three days in it," invites festival initiator and host, operabaritone Armands Siliņš.
The gate of the festival is open at 17.00 on Friday, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs with all the information on the site.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"Artists' names are available on www.sansus.lv", says Armands Siliņš.
Among the most famous artists are the violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trompetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quarteti Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian Acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erikas Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and the actress Anci Strazds created a contemporary circus performance Confines for the artist's inner fight.
Young people have also been created for the festival.
In the show children "Kukaitis" by Oļesjs Kozlovskas and Jēkabs Nīmanis, an entomologist (Cooker) Uģis Peterāns will participate with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors.
Oskars Herliņš has written the first String Quartet, while Anna Ķirse - Wood opera, performance, whose main characters will be trees in three small clusters in the wide kailcirty of Andra Kalnozols with the video projects of Katrīna Neiburga and the set design of Andra Eglīks.
When they sing in the voices of Laima Lediņas, Dinara Rudāne and Zigmars Grass, they will be in romantic relationships, just as in the study by Swedish natural scientist Karl Linnei (1729) of the Enlightenment.
In Rio de Janeiro, the Olympics are starting one of the largest hopes of the Latvian delegation, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, a seven-fighter.
Ikuniece-Admidiņa will start the competition at 15:35 after Latvia's time in the 100-metre barrier race, but at 16:50 there will be a race in the high jump.
In turn, for Saturday at 2.35 the ball will be weighed until 4.05 - 200 meters sprint will begin at night.
The Seventh Race will be concluded on Saturday, when the long jump, weeping and the 800-metre race will take place.
Prior to the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the Bronze World Championship last year, was mentioned as the candidate for the Olympic Games medals.
Even in May, the Latvian set a new state record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fight competitions in Gécise, Austria.
Ikuniece-Admidiņa also took part in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with a repeated record of Latvia.
Over the last year and a half, the athletes have corrected the state record four times.
Today at 16:16, the start is also planned for Latvian Judo fighter Arthur Nikiforenko, who starts in weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first round of the fight with Azerbaijani athletes Ušangi Kukauri.
Judist will be the first Olympics in his career.
The agency LETA already reported that on Thursday in weight category up to 100 kilograms lost already in its first battle the Latvian judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He gave way to the Japanese Hag Ruunski, who later got bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelonijs brought Latvia the Olympic Bronze Award, but during the next four Olympic Games, Latvian Yuddists won only one victory in seven fights, which was done in London directly by Borodavko.
At 16.30 a.m., Dānis Upelnieks will start the game at the booth, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The upelnieks received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that he had been quite confident about driving since April.
The sportsman arrived at the Olympics site as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to maximise the possibilities of training in the shooting.
On 19.05. the three trips after Latvian time will be performed by the Olympics debutant Katija Birzule, a 17-year-old Latvian sailor, who competes for windmills in the RS:X class.

On Saturday, the decisive final journey for medals will take place.
Today, the competition is also to be held in academic rowing, where the Irish Latvian representative Sanita Pušpure must participate.
Wednesday the competition was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Pušpure will compete in C/D semi-finals single ladies fighting for 13th place in Olympics.
On Tuesday's quarter-finals, she won the fourth place from the third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for a medal, falling behind by 0.65 seconds.
The 13th place was won four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be split into the Olympics - archery, light-shots, track cycling, riding, lifting, jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reids claims that if Clinton is elected to the post of President, she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Party of the Republic of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
The leader of the Senate’s majority told Mitch Maconnel that the next president will choose who will replace the current judge of the Supreme Court Antoninas Skalas.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reed announced that he was sure that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reida's representative later told us that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "shake the boat" with a different choice.
Garland is the main judge of the Appeals Court of the Colombian District of the United States.
Reid said that the Republicans that block the Garland nomination are "integrators" and act in the interests of the presidential candidate of the Republican Party, Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the President's work.
The Treats announces a bare calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of Pireli in the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Museum calendar it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not the naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Steve Shaw, President of the magazine Treats, announced that his erotic art magazine is different from old fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a male magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about a calendar, too.
In the press release on calendar formation, Shaw says: "We have to return to the images of unfailing and classic nakedness, where a woman's body does not embarrass, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can be sent to your photo electronically or personally during sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Rebate the buyer by trying the motorcycle, lets go.
On August 10, at 10 a.m., a motorcycle "Yamaha YZ250" stolen from the courtyard of one of the houses in Rembate parish, which has not been registered, informs the State Police.
The motorcycle owner wanted to sell the vehicle by means of the preaching work.
At the time of the meeting, the potential buyer arrived, climbed on the motorcycle as if to try it and left.
The employees of the Ogres police station of the State Police Riga Region Authority ask to refer to anyone who can provide any information useful for investigation in relation to the committed crime.
Call request: 65002403 (in working hours) or 65002400 (in 24 hours).

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video view

Shark researcher Julius Nealsen says that the long - lived record belongs to a mother, who could be between 272 and 512 years old and five feet [5 m] long.
The French court rejects the request for shops to be dismantled in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the claim of the Kale authorities to dismantle dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's hearing in Kale, the authorities indicated that the state should break down 72 self-made shops, where people sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some of the European self-made restaurants.
In Kale, the Prefect Office pointed out that these self-designed companies should be dismantled because they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential, as the food provided by governments and support groups does not provide for camp needs, where the number of inhabitants continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-designed shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille Court decided that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-designed shops, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect of Kale.
Judge Jean-Fransua Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply provide food for people living in "extremely indivisive circumstances".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French classes and provides advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult escorts.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of the children's cafe.
The letter addressed to Guardian states that the abolition of the cafe "will be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years of age."
On Friday, two charitable organizations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Jungļi" camp has increased to 9000 people, which is the highest indicator since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.

The impressive performance of the UK team at the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday, when the national team of Rio Fiji at the exciting finals in the Deodoro stadium had a convincingly defeated them with a result of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, the balls played with the leg, the support game and the brutal power game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought an honorable comfort prize - the silver medal that was the third medal of Great Britain that day. The British team can be proud of their success at the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard fight in the semi-finals, where the Box team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played in the UK final.
But in any case, Fiji's team is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, some consolation for Britain might be the fact that at least one British got a gold medal. It is Fiji's top trainer Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji was impressively starting a match, regenerating Britain’s power methods for joy.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his friends, it was like a encounter with several bus cars and the World Series champions came to the lead at 5:0 when Osea Colinisau first landed.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased its weight by realizing land in the right wing.
12:0 and the British team did not even really touch the ball.
Michael’s great power did not allow the typical Leon Nakarava to score three points, but it had little effect on Fiji’s outcome.
Games in the seventh minute Yas Veremalua got grounded in the right corner, strengthening the predominance over Great Britain by 17:0.
After the coup, Nakarava increased its weight further and had more than a minute to the end... at the end of the first half-life.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some rude British forces and crossed the line at points.
Landing provided a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play in rugby-7 matches while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a profound change in the half-time, breaking the line of Fiji players... full of four minutes, which, according to the standards of the first half-time, was good until after Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team game, got a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to get points for the British team by taking the ground in the left corner and scored 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea islanders sang, waving flags and dancing in truces.
You can’t wonder about Fiji’s joyful lifestyle.
Mata William made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another grounding at the end of the game.
In response to the end of the game, Fiji was able to celebrate, but after the defeat, the British were able to sit down in the grass.
In the first half of the day, semi-final Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where both teams were caught by land and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown put the Boxes under command, and in the second half of the year, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant craftsmanship and brought the ball between the pillars, ensuring the British victory.
Markus Watson, who is brother of England's rugby-15 team player Antonio, was a great strength tool at the end of the game that brought the team a victory and another silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races, and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helena Glovere and Hetere Staning's golden moment played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes on the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams’ echo, which inspired them to acquire up to the second Olympic gold medal in the rowing of couples, becoming the first women in British sports history who have made such a success.
They were no doubt dominated, for 39 times they won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with the elegance of the swan sliping over the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
A whole team is behind every gold medal that has been collected, working hard to keep athletes up their performance and making the greatest contribution to their success. A coach who knew if he would experience this day 30 months ago, was not aware of his cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can and did surgery.
If it didn't, it'd spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
William's cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio succeeded in enabling William to initiate a recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intersession and in reducing the duration of the break to the minimum, if it were to be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in a hospital, and I walked at a distance of 6, 10, and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be sufficient.
That's how it started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first idea was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual with excitement.
Staninga, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so a huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training mate or a better coach.
Helen Glower and Heater Staning have not lost in any race for five years.
The pair reaches as much speed as competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to approach, the weight of Staning and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen cried out, "Keeps the rhythm, keeps the rhythm."
Keeping our focus is really important.
We made a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
That day we didn't have the intention of breaking down the records, but just to row up and win the race, and that's what we did.
For a couple of years, he will rest to decide what to do.
The next month there will be the wedding of the Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashar.
So far she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

In the position of the head of the SRS of colegovs "will lead to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) are "in principle important" for the approval of the candidate Kolegov as the Minister of Finance in charge of the SRS.
Rajevski estimated that both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozola in this government were "the first big decision" that could affect him as politicians in the future.
If now the position of the SRS manager starts to change in the choice of candidate, then it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda for next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of transfer of the head of the VVD to the office of Director General of the SRS, as shown by the government agenda.
Ināra Pētersone, the Minister of Finance, Reizniece-Ozola, was directing the position of the head of the SRS in Koļegova after the resignation of Ināra Pētersone from the management of the service, and when the competition to the SRS Director-General’s post ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, in Dace Peleksk, the Chief of the SRS, in an interview with Latvian Radio, admitted that if she were offered to stand as Head, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he did not yet consider other candidates for the position of SRS manager.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, also acknowledged that the NA continues to support the leadership of the Colegov SRS.
In Spain, the deficit reduction potential is threatened by the inability to establish a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce their deficit to the 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
Estimates show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the coming time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against both countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on common rules from the outset and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Vemann, has pointed out that Europe loses confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that European Union rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the correction of the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to test the progress made by both countries over the next few months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial projections show that Portugal could meet its target in time and that the deficit could already fall to 2.5% of GDP this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on monitoring the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year the deficit must be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be set at 0.5% of GDP each year in the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not managed to reach agreement on the creation of a government for eight months now makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in the course of the year is becoming increasingly likely.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture of the third elections in the country would not change significantly either.
The most popular party is still the people's party, led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, whose election would once again result in less than 33% of the vote.
Only the socialists have increased their popularity a little, while the popularity of the parties "Podemos" or "We can together" and "Ciudanos" or "citizens" have decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants the involvement of socialists and Ciudadanos in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to the representative of the People's Party Parliamentary Group, Rafael Hernando, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughter for Europe as a whole.
The purity of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that, unfortunately, there was an increase in the number of waste found each year, and that most bathing sites are responsible for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are located in Riga.
The capital city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned up every day, but it is difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, land-based waste can be flushed into water during rainstorms, thereby significantly damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been distributed this week by volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign.
By measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has come up.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units," says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvian Radio was called, he was located on the Tūja beach, where the voluntary journey along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, even daylight bulbs left behind in the boulders of the sea had to be collected among the rest of the household waste and picnicists.
The hiking participant and organizer Ulme says that the people are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already at the breaking-up stage, cannot be identified anymore, and used for manure, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtyest beaches there are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, almost 800 pieces of waste have been collected on average in Daugavgriva every hundred meters, which is critically high.
The campaign’s organizers also explain that nearly every step is accompanied by waste and not everywhere placed warning or prohibition signs.
"The average numbers of all three bathing sites in Riga - Daugavgrīva, Western bulls and Elders - unfortunately come large and far beyond the desired goal, to which Latvia seems to be moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes.
While bathing in Riga is taking place every day, in summer hottest days even twice, the representative of the Council Uģis Interior explains.
Still, the fight against dirty visitors is difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who apply, drink alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot be done, even special signs don't work," says Interior.
Therefore, the Interior invites bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point out these abuses, and thus fight them all.
Perhaps some new warnings may be put on, but as I said, it will hardly change the situation as radically.
"As all together simply turn to and be intolerant to such offenders," he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out by the Health Inspectorate this summer for the fourth time, which can ban official bathing areas.
This year, as for other years, the quality of water everywhere is good and satisfactory.
The current situation is that the quality of water has always been good in all 56 bathing areas and there are no bathing restrictions.
"We'll take analysis for the last time at the end of August," says the Senior Environmental Health Officer of the inspection Normunds Kadiķis.
Wastes left on land during heavy rainstorms can be flushed into water.
This in turn may affect its quality, as indicated by the environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of leader in Putin's administration.
Did you leave the post yourself?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will in future be the President's Special Representative for Nature, Ecology and Transport.
When announcing the changes, Putin gave Ivanov a welcome word in front of the television cameras: "The honorable Sergey Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years together and doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you carry out your duties.
I well remember our agreement not to use you as Head of President for more than four years.
I therefore understand your desire to change the scope of action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the President's administration is a very important position and it has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Taking into account that elections to the State Council are expected in Russia next month, rumours have stated that this step is related to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also referred to as a possible substitute for Putin's President, so the claim that he wanted to take office as President's representative in nature and transport has created doubts.
As Lsm.lv's archive shows, Ivanov is the general officer of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became the Head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security doctrine" developed by Ivanovas was approved, which, among other things, provided for the revitalisation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Russian Defence Minister, and already in 2005 – as Deputy Prime Minister Mihail Fradkova and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after the loss of the President's Head of Administration, Ivanov will also retain his place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of President's Administration will now also work.
The blame comes from the family of the Soviet party in the elite.
He was recommended by Ivanov himself as Head of the President's Administration.
Anton Eduardovich and I have been familiar for a long time.
From that time on, we worked under your leadership in the government.
And for the last nearly five years, we've been dating almost every day.
"This is why I am convinced that after all his professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work," said Ivanov.
The blame comes from the family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather, Carl, has held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, was its first secretary.
The Internet edition "Meduz" with reference to the book "Estonian Self-determination and Independence" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to grant permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he had been refused and had lost his position shortly.
Shortly afterward, Wino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the President's Protocol administration.
It has already been reported that several high-ranking officials and even the arrests, including the replacement of the governors and federal representatives of several regions, have been shocked by the last impasses in Russia.
According to political scientists, President Putin restructures the ruling elite before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that, more and more often, representatives of power structures are at the top of management positions.
Jūdo's fighter Nikiforenko also loses his Olympics in the first battle.
This was the fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games by finalizing in 17th place.
Trainer Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian television that the hope of Nikiforenko was very low, and it was already clear before the race.
He also discovered that a Jesuit fighter had suffered a shoulder injury in the battle.
Significantly, in order to get to the Olympic sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than that used - namely weight category up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s fighter was 25 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko held up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed to win a pure victory.
Thus, Latvia Judo race Rio has finished.
Dreams disappear in Rio sand.
The Judaist Yevgeny Borodavko entered the Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but at times ambitious ones can be surprised.
He didn't get it.
Arturs Nikiforenko's task was even more complicated, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, even though he stayed for almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately the Latvian Judistes have been missing the most ambitions.
Gunārs Ķirsons passed from the Federation's leadership and his financial stand Vladimirs Šstakovs, Alexander Jackevičs left Latvia, "Golden Score" no longer takes place, - the development of judo runs along a descending curve.
Jackevich, who consults Kazakhstan's Judistes here, and Vsevold Zelonys don't see the heirs.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And it's the Federation's prerogative.
Therefore, the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals as part of another galaxy "Morning Panoramic".
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were eagerly waiting for beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga, as in the "death" group - for losers, games are over.
Although the Latvian duet had a small derogation - it could also be lost, but with no more than four points in two sets.
The tension of the long-standing previous game was yet to grow.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling was turned over the windy card all over the match.
For players, the starry wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed to be ours - which is more comprehensive - ally.
But he didn't.
It was quite simple to play here against the Latvian duet.
Serve so much to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
Canada was broken, and Cuba was broken at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was no more than a joke.
At that time, he could fish because there was little work, but when there was one, he did it for the honor.
The Brazilians, Samoilov, and Shmödins, could win two sets, because the first took over the leadership at 16:15, but the 16 also remained, also smashing the limit of the lost points.
But he could also lose at 0:2, because in the second, the deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, he succeeded.
The third one already went to the Evangelical Service.
There was a chain formed - unconvincing service, the second play often flies too close to the net, and Samoilov remained very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger in the square Samoilov who was against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and only on Sasha would the loss be unprofessional.
The Kreil was also wrong, and quite symbolicly, he was hit by the last ball block.
Command is being lost.
This time, too, there was no success: in the third six only two attacks by Evandri were almost out of the card, but the ball hit the line.
Two walks were next to the line.
The contentious episode was also decided by the video in favour of the opponents.
If Evandra was hit with services in the first two games, it was very productive for us.
It's all in a loss on the table.
Now the causes of failure need to be calmly analysed.
Maybe you should have lived as many next to the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps seven semi - finals were given some confidence.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but sooner come here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a problem with finding the upper part of the sporty form.
So far, there are more questions than answers.
For our beekeepers, the game's over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left, as well as Jurmala Master.
Samoel and Shmölov have never been friends in life, and there will be no such, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When a dream of Olympic medals is broken, the idea of divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only in itself but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to make a distinction, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the bee, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Michael Samoilov are still too green to begin to conquer the world’s peaks.
You can try Harald Regès, Alexander Solovey, Edgars Tocho, back to Mārtiņš Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself many times in the stages of the World Cup.
They didn't smile in the co-cabana sand this time.
And that's it.
Of course, account should also be taken of the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, that new pairs are moving, and that only the rare size is less than two metres.
It does not guarantee success yet, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don't stay any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the game operators, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyballists have found a hotel in Cosakabana.
This time, we offered very modest accommodations for journalists at a very high price.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes it may be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, rent apartments on Copacabana and Ipanema border.
Beach 200 meters, half an hour walk of a bee arena.
The area is quite sure, because the Favella is nearby, but not here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovičs is not what some think of at once, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre race and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa was lagging behind her personal record.
But there are five more disciplines.
After a 10 year break "Porgy and Bess" is sounding in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the primary school of "Porgy and Bess" was performed in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly performed.
That is why the organizers of the Cesis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gueršvin's chef.
"We are very happy that after a ten-year break when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera performance, this great version of the opera concert "Porgy and Bess" by George Guerschwyn can be enjoyed with us at the new, newly opened concert hall "The Great Amber"" says Baiba Bože, the director of the concert hall "The Great Amber".
Opera "Porgy and Besa" is a story about love, its volatility, passion, household tragedies and simple everyday joys in bright music.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this story of love is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairichs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these shifts from one character to another, enlightening one personality or another personality, or choirs or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the music director and conductor Andris Poga of the concert of opera "Porgy and Bess".
Opera visitors agree that this is a grand event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous opera.
Happily, Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Executive professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert was special because for the first time in the newly discovered concert hall "Lielais dzintars" an orchestra was played in the orchestra pit and for the first time an opera concert was held.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named Janis Rozentāls.
The vice-president of Riga Andris Americas at the opening of the exhibition of the Rozentāls anniversary told that the museum's own address in the future could be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentāla Square 1.
Māra Lāce, the Director of the Museum, admitted that re-registration of the address would create a good bureaucratic burden, but overall, the idea is welcomed and therefore agreed with the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga has laid a basic stone for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Burkards Dzens Janis Rozentāls, who stands at the museum.
Wilhelms Purvitis, the then director of the museum, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
All the time, I'm a little upset with my conscience, but Wilhelm Purvitis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Láce.
It was said that the building of the National Museum of Art, after extensive reconstruction and modernisation, officially opened its doors this May.
This week will finally begin reconstruction of VEF Culture Castle.
The castle for about 11 million euros will be restored by "Velve" Ltd.
It is planned to renovate several premises of the castle, including two viewing rooms, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to raise the funds of the European Union in the amount of six million euros for the project, however, Oļegs Burovs, Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, admits that the project is not yet fully clear.
"In spite of the fact that the political will to start repair of the VEF Culture Castle by attracting European structural funds is, we expect a decision for months, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will have its money allocated or not," Burov says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you should take the same decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
At the moment, we see another round of discussions coming up again, well, then let us see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council no doubt guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed within the time limits," says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Castle collectively organised a farewell concert before the expected renovations of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of Riga City Council Property Department the renovation of VEF Culture Castle is divided into teams of seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the availability of VEF Culture Castle and improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the building facade.
The second is improvement of the VEF Culture Castle service offer.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of Līvu, you can get acquainted with the legendary rock group at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various items characterising "Līvus" - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010 when the group is announced to the end of its activities.
Participants will also show stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert records, as well as other things not yet seen to the general public that reflected the creative work of the group "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieks.
The musicians, who were associated with the Līvi group and their loved ones, also responded to the call and shared with both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Līvu" were found in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was established at the Liepaja House of Culture, led by Juris Pavietols.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic shows.
In 1976, the fateal meeting took place when Juris Pavilis met Ēriks Ķigelis and established a group at the metalurgs Culture Palace, inviting to join Ingrīds Gutmanis, Andris Kružiņas and Janis Groduma.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not been considered once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see - jeans, hairy and beards, these boys were very different from the stereotype of the popular chord," says music spectator Klās Vāvere.
In addition to the above mentioned musicians, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rėgėjs, Tālis Semibarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Breze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Klein and many others have worked.
Admission to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, the Līvi group's 40th anniversary celebration "LĪVIfest 2" will take place at Liepaja concert garden "Pūt, vējņi".
For the first time in 8 months, there is inflation in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest figure since 2012 and the first figure above zero since October of last year when it was positive (0.2%).
Average annual inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% compared to the previous year and the average monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), entertainment and cultural events (6.3%), hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); for home appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); for health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the level of the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevič: The time is coming, and the truth is being raised.
Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevičs in an interview with the Independent emphasizes that if we want to gain strength for life, the Gospel message should be placed at its centre.
For the power of truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Christmas celebration of the Most Holy Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, Pope Nunzi has expressed his desire to lead the main church service in Aglona.
Thus, the content of the main message is also up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that the Cross Road is led by Bishop Jānis Bulis.
He will also create his own message.
I've been running the church service of the wililian festival the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francisco's encyclical Laudato si and updated the common house, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world and trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with what the church recommends that the Gospel message be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for further progress.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the discussion in Cesis, Lampa, you said "to return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a resource of return today?
The Indian capital was surrounded by a man dying on the road.
No one in the capital of India seems to know about a deadly man dying on the road - it turns out that he lay on the road for an hour and then still robbed, informs BBC.
It's been reported that a man identified as Matibole traveled in the morning with a rickshaw and worked as a guard at night.
At 5:30 a.m., Matiboul went home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The record of the surveillance cameras shows that the driver would step out of the car to see the victim, and then left.
An hour later, when no one seemed to have ever known that he was a bleeding man, he was robbed by a garner.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived at the site and the victim was brought to the hospital where the injuries were caused.
Inga Kolegova, the Head of the State Environment Service, has saved the government from falling, says Ojārs Skudra, the Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
The explanation by Colombia of the withdrawal of the nomination in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA said that it was hard for him to imagine that next week, the Government's Unity meeting would support the Kolegov candidacy.
Consequently, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but the Kolegova still had its office approved, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also considers that Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniecie-Ozola and the Prime Minister Māri Kučinski prior to the announcement of the nomination.
At the same time, it was also a concessions to the Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether a suitable candidate could be found through the competition, Skudra admitted that there were two options: either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution as the principal executive officer will continue to be run by Dace Pelek.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that another candidacy is not being examined, it would be a hint to the Grey that he should not take part in the competition.
LETA already informed that the Head of State Environment Service Kolegova decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of SRS.
Due to "Unity", the government postponed on Tuesday for a week the approval of Kolegov as Director-General of the SRS.
Following the Government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she was still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, later her thoughts changed - in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she indicated that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the office of Chief of the SRS and that she was not an easy choice.
Andrejs Vaivars, press secretary of Prime Minister Māra Kučinskas explained to the agency LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of SRS.
In the centre of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon there was an accident involving the State Police Car.
A police car with sound and light signals has hurried to the highest category of call until Krišjānis Baronas and Dzirnavu street cross with another car.
The police explain the circumstances that occurred, but the preliminary information indicates that the other vehicle has not missed a police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
The number of inhabitants is falling in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the major cities with a population of over one million.
According to the data of the EU Statistical Office Eurostat, there is the largest proportion of women in Riga - the capital of Latvia is firmly among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the largest proportion of women in Europe's major cities: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
The warning pictogram will be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed near the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), a representative of the Riga City Council's Property Department Baiba Gailite told the agency LETA.
Currently, the rapid damage repair of the museum's glasshouse has been successfully completed as a result of skateboarding.
In the coming days warning pictograms will be placed near it.
They will tell the people that the cover can be slippery rain and snow in time, not to move with cars, as well as to travel with bicycles, rollers and rollers.
On this social network "Facebook" was also written at the time by Ušakovs, who pointed out that no safety risks are caused by the damage, but "seems uncurated", and skateboardists "will have to drive".
Holiday for children and parents - New children playgrounds are set up in Riga.
In this summer season the municipality of Riga has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čekurkalns, which are already available to children.
On the beach of Kipsala there is a large, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trampolines and ski hills.
Playground for children of all ages.
The field also includes swings and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small sailors is lightened by the location of the fairway on the river Daugava with a view to the passenger port and cruise ships visible there.
In turn, a playhouse, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play bombs and other game elements are installed in the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-line of Čiekurkalns, as well as a gym with circles of strength and coordination for exercises, shelters and other sports elements.
Under the area covered with rubber in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement is applied to the playground from the street.
A reconstructed road section was discovered in honey.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, State Roads of Latvia (LVC) management of SJSC, as well as representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and local authorities today opened the reconstructed Russian border of the main road (Grebņeva) - Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medumi) (A13) section from Medums to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are a country's business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to open a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that the co-financing of European Union funds improves the situation on national major roads.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be learned already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most busy roads in very good quality, as well as ensuring the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without any funding from the European Union," Uldis Augulis stressed by turning the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
During the construction phase from Medums to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05. km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed road section the road construction has been completely restored and next year the repair works will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main roads of the country are most busy, and by 2018, we plan to ensure that all major roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in good time and to make a replacement of asphalt top layer every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers hopefully look at the proposals developed by the expert group to put in place the road financing system", said Lange.
Within the framework of the project, the road connections and lighting are arranged in the Medumi Centre.
Significant ground work has been carried out: in four stages large-scale desurbation and large-scale burial and burial works, a long profile of the road has been levelled, which so far has been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a new turnaround area for public transport has been built.
In the past, the road had insufficient capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road of common terrain.
During the next construction season it is planned to re-establish the section of the road from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform different types of works in more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all planned repair works on the National Road Network is available on the LVC website at www.lvcelli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight-loss results, the right choice of combinations of foods is very important", says Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kukleriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruit, berries and vegetables.
Combination of thoughtful foods can help not only reduce excess weight, but also specifically promote various body processes.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination as they provide a long-lasting sata feeling and help to fight fat.
Research published in the European Clinical Journal has shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel better.
Cayne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktail, not only makes you feel satanic, but also reduces your desire for large meals in your next meals.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of a layer of fat in the abdomen.
The eggs contain a metabolic nutrition - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
With sufficient intake of these nutrients, cortisol levels can be reduced and thus fat accumulation around the middle of the body.
Oat flakes, to which fresh berries have been added, are another delicious and fat - burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, control the Greenland - an appetite stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are auxiliary to weight reduction as well as prevent fat formation.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform wonders of weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satanicness.
The vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the sense of sata.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a sata sensation for a longer time.
You can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from a finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
Which product combinations should be avoided.
The fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the gardens is polysaccharide.
The fruits are broken down mechanically into the stomach, while they do not chemically disintegrate until they reach the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that occurs in the gut.
The hard is divided into three different stages, which begins already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "cracked" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is found in saliva, works only in alkaline environment.
Fruitic acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheeses and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each of which has different strength, characteristics and time to enter the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muskatmelone and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are found in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
The fat forms a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - the fat inhibits protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If high protein-containing products are consumed, avoid total fat intake.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing proteins) with whole avocados (containing fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How to cook better?
"Food preparation, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products," the nutritionist points out.
In most cases nutrients are lost by cooking food in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by boiling.
It is recommended to use the liquid remaining after cooking for soup preparation - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables are prepared, including by steaming.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
The amount of lycopene is increased by 25% when feeding tomatoes for 30 minutes.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them more easily digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes it easier to absorb iron and other minerals in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C from 10% to 90%, but fibre freezing does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the level of iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body receives up to 33% less non-haemorrhagic iron, found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products, than the bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non- haematological iron in the body by eating products containing non- haematological iron along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood-braining iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To obtain maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil to them.
When preparing your salmon sandwiches, add the rich salmon or sardines of vitamin D without added yoghurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in the formation of bone.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries help to stabilise cholesterol levels as well as to avoid artery obstruction.
Snapchat Anime's effect is criticised for Asian fighting
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistally insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity on a daily basis in a rather absurd way.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit in the painting of Roy Lichstein.
Lens are vague, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become public.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past, receiving the criticism that the application promotes too black-and-white skin tones as an ideal beauty standard.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to create chaotic eyes, spicy teeth and round faces, and some critics described it as a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow face”.
Also, the question was asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had bigger problems with diversity.
News and public troubles broke out on Wednesday, when the publications The Verge and Motherboard announced that the effects of lenses have been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens was to depict the images of Anime rather than to capture Asian people.
However, these effects reminded those who had experienced racism of their painful stereotypes.
Others strongly denied the likeness of Anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student of Korean origin, received a wide resonation about the images. In an e-mail letter she indicated that the effects of the lens are "injuring and embarrassing, not to say more".
She added that it was difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the effect of the lens is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's great youth audience, which represents different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "in today's days such things don't go unnoticed," Katie Jou, 25-year-old, said in his interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Jou, Product Manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and her phone interview, she explained that she felt that the race problems were due to Snapchat’s employment policy, which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou was criticised by the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then closed its article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not take up such a position as to be able to express their views safely and easily," says Chinese American Jou.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company has paid a staff specialist who will focus on the representation of racial minorities who are not widely represented and will facilitate their inclusion in the company.
Jou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is wrong."
The Congress Chamber declares that military officials have distorted reports of the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Assembly Chamber points out that the US Central Command has distorted the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it is.
Analysts of the Central Command's intelligence service express general dissatisfiance with the provisional report of the mission team set up by the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the representatives of the Republican Defence Financing Sub-Committee, stating that their leadership controlled reports on the success of America in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report shows that intelligence reports, confirmed by the high-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the fight against terrorism in the United States in a more positive way than is actually the case.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the California Republic, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors can be found in the senior management of the organisation.
This 10-page long report reflects in detail the existing problems in the presentation and analysis of the Central Command of America's efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide insurmountable evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration had caused the reports to be distorted, it shows that the management of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to reflect a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
According to the report, in the first half of 2015, the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Government showed Congress a much more positive situation than it was actually.
For example, the representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could already start in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Party of the Republic of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, says in his report: "The investigation of more months clearly confirms this."
Other information: Member of the ICC.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic state is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation of the intelligence activities of Centcom.
On Thursday, members of the Democratic Party of the Committee for Intelligence published their own report in which they agree to certain conclusions of the Republican Party Working Group.
In his report, the Democratic Representative, Adams B. Schiff, said that between 2014 and 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports on the ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Šifas explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the ethics of analysts and "distributed facts that were not true."
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with the 'pre-defined or political position'.
The Daily Best published the preliminary results of the convention investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that Pentagon’s general inspectorate had launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Patrick Evans, Lieutenant - Officer of the Pentagon, announced that Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence authorities call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement expressed by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports by the Central Government on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reminds us of more than ten years old events when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Huker published a study claiming that the administration of George V. Bush started the Afghan war, with too little thought for its possible consequences.
Hoker also played an important role in the opening of the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Huker team discovered that, contrary to public reports, the air strikes for the Islamic National Oil Plant did not significantly deteriorate the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in its September edition that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the central administration.
At the time, Centcom Commander General Loid Austin III received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers considered that war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Austin retired and in his place General Joseph L. Votel took office.
In the U.S. duel with Great Britain, women's field hockey wins the U.S., thus gaining the fourth successive victory.
The day after winning Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama got the first two gates for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember whether they ever managed to do so.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not the people who number their gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an undisputed with the United Kingdom, which on Thursday after winning over Japan, with the result of 2:0 remaining unwinned.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams are already qualified for a quarter final and the game will determine only which team will take the first place in a group of six teams and which second.
The first winners will avoid meeting a strong Dutch sample for a little longer, which is the second group leader.
Despite the fact that the Saturday game has not developed, the Americans have already called a surprise storm, taking the last place among 12 teams in London four years ago.
The team also included Bama
She grew up in Blubel, a field hockey bat she first took into her hands at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters had already been involved in this sport in Dreksel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a sample of the newest players in history.
She wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get to the finals.
However, 2012 was a year of failure for her and her team.
The following year English Craig Parham was appointed as a sample trainer and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
We didn't invest as much in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
On Thursday's game Bama discovered the result by getting the gate in the first half of the time with the rear throw from close distance.
India started the game without winning in its account, but their selection was very harsh and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama once again got the gate.
She put the ball in the enemy zone on the left side of the square, then noticed to get to the middle of the square and send the ball to the enemy gate, putting it under the direction of the American 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez received another gate.
This was the first U.S. Gatekeeper Jackie Brig's dry game, with each of the first three games running through one of the gates.
She's gone.
And so does Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how good will show you the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is "Serious Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room for a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such fine culinary delicacies as the goose liver pastet or Fuagra and the Maryland turtle soup.
However, that day his meal was much more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "This is a way to solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard to deal with."
Her husband, Andru Kou, adds, "It's also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
The last book of Kou "Garden Sautage" describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane in his book "97 Ābeles" describes life through food rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Serious Meal," to be published on Tuesday by the publishing house Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Expressing some solidarity in the culinary, they took a meal together with the reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch meal in the Flatiron district, which has been running since 1929, when the great depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmanes ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old.
When the reporter ordered a fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the discussion about the food of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the false bunny was very popular.
There was peanut bunny, liver bunny and bean bunny.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is to eat so much peanuts that they are at lunchtime.
Mr. Cou's abomination.
"Surely it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were going to eat to their men-workers, and freshly prepared condiments were served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I it was Americans who sent Europeans a meal. "Serious Meal" describes how Americans adapted to the circumstances when America suddenly was no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this subject.
The new budget diets became equally important: such unknown dishes as counterfeit bunny and stews became everyday; stews were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under the creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when calories and nutritional value were more important than taste, young, unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Ms. Ziegelmanes found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: 'This was not a popular lunch table addition'.
Mrs Ziegelmane emphasises: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and chicory onion are incompatible.
Many home recipes applied during difficult times.
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, determined eating habits that had not been experienced before and after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that housewives become "economics" and accept such challenges as turning pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
Saturiņicīts " is a feast of historical delicacies.
It is particularly interesting to see the attitude of the government towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Kower's "allow me to eat cakes" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and feeding in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr Cou says: "He liked European cuisine, for example, a fish with a cucumber sauce."
He ate a nearly golden living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely disfellowshipped from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example in his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt paid the home servant who didn't learn to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most untasted dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst prepared dishes".
As soon as the country’s economy recovers, most of the culinary signatures of the Era of depression disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to the calories and nutritional value, as well as to the way science is applied in culinary, Mrs. Ziegelmane.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of the mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw away food.
"She really was afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually shocked people."
There was an incident with wind cakes once.
When we ate in the Eisenberga menu, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert — a plum bottle that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's a plum foam," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time the habit of giving a chic name to modest dishes was common.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently immersed their spoons in the brown mass that was on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr Cou ate a few more mooses.
He sounded like an experienced "economician", he said to his wife, "Shrink a speck of milled hazelnut."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has ruled that “Gilead Sciences Inc.” is entitled to reimbursement of expenses for legal services it has paid in the case concerning the termination of the hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company “Merck & Co Inc.”
In June, Gilead was justified by a fine of GBP 200 million for the loss of two Merck patents, which threatened it with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found irregularities in Merk’s activities, such as lying after taking an oath and other non-ethical activities.
On Thursday, U.S. Regional Justice Bet Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to get position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredients of sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead.
The forces supported by the United States claim that they have taken full control of the city of Manbidja from the Islamic State.
The U.S. forces have taken full control of the city of Manbidja in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have abandoned the city, announced by a group representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civil citizens who had been repressed by the fighters, said to the news agency Reuters from the military council of Manbidja, allied by the SDS.
"Now the city is under our full control and we are carrying out a search for combatants," he informed the agency Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton's income reached USD 10.75 million and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published the 2015 tax return showing that the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
During 2015, Clintons donated USD 1 million, mainly to their Clinton Charity Organization. Former President Bill Clinton earned approximately USD 5.3 million, speaking as a spy and former Secretary of State earned USD 3 million in income from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton Elections Ally - The senator Tim Kein and his wife, Anna Holton, of the state of Virginia, have published their tax return for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Tramp lies behind various excuses and reservations so as not to keep promises of disclosure of tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a practice recorded by the US presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers refer to an audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in a Twitter entry, the tax information of the Democratic Party candidates was communicated by Ians Sams, a partner of the Clinton campaign.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information before the audits had been completed.
Trampa critics, including the presidential candidate of the Republican Party of 2012, Mits Romnij and other Republican, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate volumes, donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton turned oil into fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans demand Trump to publish its tax information.
She returned to this issue during her economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for several decades."
Politico says that during the 1990s Trump has paid very little or no tax for two years and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column told us that many accountants and lawyers believe that today nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are an essential issue in this presidential election.
Clinton promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30% in support of the billioner's Galen Buffet proposal.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also located, Buffet called on Tramppe to exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he is also being audited by the Revenue Service, and Trump fears voters rather than tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clintons now live in Chad, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clintoni received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for removing Israel's long-range conversation code at the request of an Arab man - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin has stirred up a storm in social media when he discovered that there is no Israeli long-range conversation code available at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin. The hotel employees base this on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his frustration with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel’s far-reaching code on the hotel list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that could be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that, in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel is trapped and destroyed?
It's Lancman.
Instead, the hotel "Kempinski Bristol" offers to call the country through its call center.
The Director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman says that he's shocked by the answer he's received.
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a conscious decision of the hotel's management".
The reason for the removal of the code was even worse for the film director.
"The vast majority of guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jakov Hada-Handelsman, has called this case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this is exactly what happened in Germany is that there is even more humiliation in this network of hotels.
No explanation required.
The official pointed out: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also had a rather wide resonance on the Internet, where people described it as a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel is simply designed for Arab customers.
Someone else said "hate" by saying that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendam street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all the accusations, declaring that all this is "misunderstood" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski's representative.
And it is added that the code has again been added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student-police clash was held on Thursday in the city of São Paulo in Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education system reforms.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the law enforcement tried to expel students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their displeasure to the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of São Tomé and Príncipe, Geraldo Alckmin, provides for the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of supporting the suspended President Dilma Rousef, whose influence was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skinner finish first, bringing the United Kingdom a gold medal for cycling
Kelums Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in the Sprint race in Rio, which took place last night. The British team protected its champion title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
A 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy proud and bringing victory to the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Championship in London, even though Hoy had already completed his career as a sportsman.
The problems were at a stage between Beijing and London's Olympics, because it was necessary to replace Jamie Staf, an experienced starter.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
British coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing in him the potential that he later proved.
Hinde, Kenny, champions who four years ago started with Hoy and Skinner, who set up an Olympic qualification record, but the New Zealand team was better at the race.
However, the British trio got gold medals.
Hindes had a close circle of encouragement, Kenny came up to take the lead, and Skinner guarded this direction.
The change of strategy played an important role in victory, because Hindes drove with a higher gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindez at the moment they climbed to the honorary pedestal.
A 23-year-old glassgoal said, "It was an inexorable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
In the final, we set the Olympic record and won the World champions.
It was simply incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning together with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed that they deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
Later, he rebutted that comment, and British competitors could not prove the opposite.
This time, though, there were no such incidents.
Hindes said, "British flags in the tribunals brought London to mind."
Over the last three months, we have become a united team.
We've lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will race for a country that won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed repeat Hoi’s success by obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was born on March 23 (it seems that it is the holy date of the Britishs, because Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Roger Banisters were also born this day).
Hoy was also born on that day.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said: "At this time I just enjoy all this.
Team travel is always the best.
Because then you can win with the teammates.
If honest, one wins a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as an armor."
That day it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clency, Steve Burke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification time for four kilometers.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vignin will definitely be at the centre of attention.
Yesterday, before his qualification, he had a disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the women's journey that will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joan Rovssel Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milan, installed a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping. will win medals in the middle of the Olympics.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented achievements in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, after accusations of sexism and abuse of dignity, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also finish their career.
However, starting with the first bicycle race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the portal’s meltdown is becoming uncertain because an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of aluminium meltdowns and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear, because its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the Victorian Government to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be suspended in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 jobs of the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
Moreover, it will also have unintended side effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a break in operation of the Englandsee power plant.
The Alcoas Portland meltdown works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by the speculation that had lasted several years about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of the factory’s production.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its "Loy Yang A" power plant in Latroubes, says that it is likely that the other three owners will terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's shares also belong to Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL hopes to continue the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the melter," said its representative.
"AGL" announced that contracts are so-called "risk-limiting contracts" to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in 2017 fiscal year," said the company's representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already taken into account losses of $ 187 million in its forecasts, with these contracts being terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue its activities or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010 it concluded an agreement with "Loy Yang" for 20 years, but in November it will be discontinued. The company does not provide any explanation why it will stop cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns both about the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and about the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy in the sector.
The Executive Director of AGL, Steven Mikelson, said last week that according to analysts estimates, he uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts per year.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people's demands are rejected every year, and the budget cuts could lead to a worsening of the situation.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal expulsions - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that a reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have done so far.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland legal centre, said that the latest report by the National Judicial Centers Association says that thousands of people in need are now refused legal aid.
Mr Farell pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation would only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland legal centre is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance."
People who try to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are divorced, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not get the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Prosecutor General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the cuts immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get this.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also focus on the needs of local communities and their clients and the Palazčuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued in court because one of the employees drew a gun
New York: The agents of the Donald Trump campaign have been sued in court because they have not acted on information that its North Carolina Operation Manager has turned a firearm against a staff member when they were driving in a single car in February.
This incident was described in a court claim lodged on Wednesday by Vincent Bardhi, a former programmer of the campaign, in the Charlotte court.
He said that he had been waiting months for the internal examination of this case to start, but he understood that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Philip "striped out the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the boot against Vincent's knee," Borde says in his complaint.
He also said that when he lodged complaints with the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordhi learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Irons don't have to shoot to cause damage," says Bardhi in his complaint.
Only two days before this case was submitted, the candidate for President of the Republic caused a scandal, telling people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of weapons and enthusiasts, could act in the event of his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges winning the election.
The Trampa campaign declared that the media had taken his words out of context, and he never incited anyone into violence.
Horde wants to recover compensation from campaign organisers for negligence in monitoring, and from Philippe for attack, illegal weapon use and emotional stress.
Trampa's representative Hope Hicks did not comment immediately.
Unable to contact Phillips.
The WCCB-Barlot Local News Agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
Also, it has not been possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultation Services".
The presidential candidate of the Republican Party, Donald Tramps, has conducted a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - parish and sports festival in Kūļciems.
On Saturday at Kūļciems, for the first time people gathered for the parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that Lake’s festival would be gone.
A new page has now been split.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious because, for example, darts had to drop into a sleeping target, the boot was flying, with the left hand of the man, "bombling" was not at all in any of the Olympics.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, diligent, and considerate he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in an open-air estrade, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "child corner" where the little ones could find themselves in inflatable attractions and get a new image in a pony make-up.
The new one, which could also become a tradition, was the parade of the motor vehicles and motorcycles.
Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of the administration of Kūļciems Parish, who wished a nice rest and a dry time, however, the rain fell, but it could not interfere much.
The festival continued with the greetings of Kūļciems’ latest residents.
It's really good that the parish is filled with five girls and one boy.
Art collectives from Engure region had come to perform in the villagers – the audience loved the performances of the older dance group "Rudens rhythms", the performers of various folk dances "Redas" and the performances of the young dancers "Golden pearls".
And it's okay that there was some way to slip on the wet stage.
Of course, local people and visitors were delighted by the famous actor duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Morgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as Berzciems attractive wives from fishermen's farm "Dieniņas".
The Ball was played by the Brog.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we made a huge effort to win all the regions of the country from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Esstend got a lot of money from the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the area around Heathrow.
As in the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the extension of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never succeed in preparing for the Olympic Games during the time and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they would not be right in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole and not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, with economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth GBP 11 billion, starting with the terminal 5, which has been called the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with the terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the enlargement of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman goes on a highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the hard night, he got down on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses of an accident when she crossed several cars early on Thursday morning on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morge in Vo canton.
Vo Canton’s police report says that, desperately trying to commit suicide, the woman had gone to the road in the dark, where she was driven by several cars.
The victim, a 49 - year - old Swiss woman, has gathered several cars, including a heavy car, trying to kill himself clearly.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others have not yet been identified, says the police, who call on the drivers and witnesses involved.
The case also opened a criminal investigation, which is a logical step, the lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hoffteller adds, "The prosecutor will find out about this."
Two similar cases that have taken place over the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night.
Date of Birth: a) 1 January 1967, b) Approximately 1967.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman who was on his way to the accident site was driving in a manner that was appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional event".
Anyone who has information about an accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet collects signatures for a new SRS manager to organise a competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has launched the collection of signatures for a new Head of State Revenue Service (SID) competition.
A petition addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens/farmers (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of nomination.
Petition was established on August 10th and is currently signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of Inga Kolegov, the candidate general director of the SRS, is opaque and non-professional.
It recalls the best Soviet Union functional traditions.
It discredits public administration and once again makes public opinion disappointed in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," says the petition.
The author Jānis B. indicated that the public does not know the criteria for choosing the post of Kolegova.
Likewise, it is not clear what the candidates' intentions in SRS are.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition, which actively addresses professional candidates, attract personnel selection specialists and offer appropriate remuneration.
The Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, officially nominated Kolegovas as Head of the SRS last week, was to approve him in his new position this week in the government, but all the ministers of the "Unity" of the party voted against, so the question was postponed for a week.
Samoilov: If we lost, I played bad.
There is no difference in the place where the competition was concluded, but after leaving the tournament, Samoilov said about the beach's volleyballists Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for the prize in Rio de Janeiro during the Olympic Games.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball couples in the final and decisive event of the subgroups with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Evandr Gonsalvesch Oliveir and Pedro Solberg Salgadas to the Brazilians, concluding their participation in the four-year major sports forum.
In three subgroup matches Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio of three small points between couples was then counted, which after the convincing loss suffered by this match was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duet.
"In the first six we were led, but from 16:15 we stayed for 16 points," Shmēdiņš remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
It can't be played.
Then, in the second six, everything was fine, and at the top of the set was able to break the game, and it should have been a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it in the same way, but after changing the sides, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all teams had three sets, so the small points were important.
"It was necessary to play more like this, not repeatedly to give back 3-4 points in a row," said the athletes.
We knew Evandra could be maintained.
"In the first six we got through it, in the second we put 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 a game went to him," remembered Shmēdiņš.
We tried to show you the best game.
It happened at times, not at times.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as few points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, so I played bad," said Samoilov.
We were expecting a good service from Evandru, and it made it quite easy for us to make an attack on our first shoulders.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes at Pedro’s service, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov said that today, unlike the previous match, athletes were not nervous.
"We went, we played, we had protection, but we needed better service reception," the athletes said.
"They played well and in the end they came to the cave."
Before the tournament, we said immediately that the draw was the more uncomfortable it could have been.
We also had the prospect of fighting for the first place, but we did not even get out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for a medal and we were also of ourselves, but then there is no difference anymore - 25th or 4th place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov had a third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 in Beijing he started with Martin Pļaviņa, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second beginning of the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of the consumer as well as potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the gas market design and legal framework."
"This is why we are actively involved in drafting and commenting on regulations, as well as submitting our proposals," said Bidere.
The agency BNS has already wrote that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Commission for the regulation of public services and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed the draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers "Regulations on trade and use of natural gas" that will change the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, ensuring the right of natural gas users to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
When working on the new natural gas market regulation, the EM aims to make the process of trading in natural gas as simple as possible and user-friendly.
Therefore, as the most effective and user-friendly service solution, the "centre model of the trader" has been selected, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader – one contract, one invoice and one place of provision of information and customer service, leaving technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
We remind you that a gradual opening of the market is planned for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price has been imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
Economic operators, on the other hand, will have to choose the natural gas trader with whom the natural gas contract is to be concluded.
Prior to the conclusion of a contract for the sale of natural gas, the trade of natural gas will be ensured by the former natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers specify the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedure by which natural gas is supplied to and ceased to be supplied to users, requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified facility in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure for settlement of the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedure for changing traders and the supply of the natural gas to users in the event of disruption of natural gas supply; the procedure by which the public trader ensures the supply of natural gas to related users.

Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchanges in the US and Europe are growing, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with investor confidence having a positive impact on the statements of the Saudi Arabian Minister of Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil-beneficiary countries will take action at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also led to an increase in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar grew on Thursday in relation to the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In the electronic trade of the New York Stock Exchange, the WTI mark price of crude oil for deliveries on Thursday increased by $1.78 per barrel to $43.49.
The Brent crude oil price for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange in October increased by $1.99 - to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canned manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" last year is falling by 33.8%.
Last year's turnover of the canned manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" was EUR 4.2202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year before, while the company's losses dropped by 5,7 times - to EUR 904,7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published by "Lursoft".
According to the company's management report, in 2015 the company worked with losses caused by several reasons, including the persistent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the credit line in force and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without being able to execute them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to obtain a discount on volume.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the factory to purchase new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
The financial indicators of the company last year were also negatively affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers admitted price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - highest - prices," the company's management pointed out.
Also in 2015 "Blue Lagoon" started discussions with potential investors, including evaluation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allow to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment, which ensures higher production speed, was purchased only," the company's management pointed out.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the production company to fulfil such orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the Protocols on sales of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the Protocols on sales of the product.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", the company's management points out.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish deliveries to Iraq in August 2016.
The Blue Lagoon has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA this September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and 5,113 million euros losses.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a fixed capital of EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igora Širšon (10,89%).

The insurer shall pay compensation to the passengers of the air flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance to a family for the cancellation of the air carrier at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, which led to the refusal of the intended visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, an application for reimbursement was received from a customer.

As a result of the reconstruction of the village, a man is forced to leave his home at a ruined ceiling.
Dmitrijs Saidjaševs, whose neighbor has started the major repairs in his apartment, has been addressing the 4th studio of LTV, and since then Dmitrijs is not convinced that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has damaged ceilings.
Then I informed the Riga building board, the house manager and other organizations.
The construction board said we were not an operational service and we had no expert.
"The owner must go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry says.
The guest expert arrived, recorded the event and admitted that the cover was not in a satisfactory state.
But since Dmitry’s first application at the building board, no one was able to answer the question as to whether the presence of the apartment was life threatening.
The construction board said this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then they wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there is an impasse," Dmitry says.
After considering the whole pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, even though it can be heard at times that someone is working there.
Within two months, an expert must be carried out and within six months, all these defects must be rectified by the owner of the apartment who performs repairs.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this non-volatile structure is affected, so it is not certain that there is a danger to the owner of the lower apartment.
"This is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is between 70 and 700 euros, but in this case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert's opinion is awaited, the building board has decided that both apartments should not be operated, both in which construction works are carried out and in which Dmitry's apartment is located.
"This is the case in the case of the construction board in practice, where, due to their ignorance or simply their unwillingness, the citizens may have posed a threat not only to their own property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the building board.
Now Dmitrij has to find another place to live with - relatives, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry may try to recover from his neighbor’s civil routine, which may take a lot of time.
Because of the extracurricular construction, it is now forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer makes his own conclusion, and it may have to be expected for up to three weeks.
The resulting losses will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with a prison sentence for up to six months because the building board has not taken into account what it said.
Guess it!

The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, the agency LETA is told by Gita Želve, representative of the manager of the future hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" Ltd.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of restoration of the former Ķemeri sanatorium.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
She points out, however, that it will be located in a polyclinic building in the former Ķemeri resort, with an area of about 12,000 square feet [12,000 sq m].
The clinic will be located on three floors.
Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic are owned by the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by several investors who invest in this fund, according to Želve.
As George Jones, Executive Director of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the construction of the former resort clinic, in total for investments in excess of 30 million euros.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park in more than 42 hectares area, in the restoration of roads and street sections, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism facility, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of the parking lot in Emila Dariņa street, which will promote socio-economic development of Jurmala city and the increase in the number of tourists, Jurmala City Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financed by three to four million euros.
Design work is planned until mid-2017, but construction and arrangement work will start next autumn.
As reported earlier, the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" plans to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness clinic".
However, the reconstruction lasted.
In its 2010 review it was further claimed that by regularly communicating with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to ensure daily technical control at the "Ķemeri" sanatorium, Ominasis will definitely be finished "reconstruct of the future hotel Ķemeri" in 2011 and immediately start the preparation for the opening of the "Kempinski" chain hotel.
In October 2014 its readiness to buy the Ķemeri sanatorium of Ķemeri belonging to the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" was confirmed by Park Hotel Ķemeri at the auction, but one month later the auction was declared not to have happened, because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the set time.
The sale price was set according to the starting price of the last auction, which was EUR 2.86 million.
LETA was informed by Ieva Aile, representative of the City Council, when signing the protocol, that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union structural funds, the infrastructure that will be adapted will be restored to the historic Kemeri park, an interactive nature tourism facility will be created, roads and parking places will be arranged.

Russian hackers have broken the e-mail of former NATO Commander Bradlow.
The hackers, who broke the DNC computers, might have committed several other cyber attacks, also broken the e-mail of the former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bridlov and the servers of the George Soros Institute Open Society, on Thursday was told by Bloomberg Business News Agency.
The hackers have published the information on the DCLeaks.com website.
Among other things, there were correspondence from Bridlov and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute’s computers have been available for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers connected to Russia's special services who broke DNC's e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, for its part, reports that the US President Barack Obama administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, in response to the collapse of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to appeal against Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities to officially attack the Democratic Party's servers in cyber attacks.
According to the report, the WikiLeaks website published in July about 20 000 e-mails from the DNC computer system, from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the campaign of the party candidate Hilaria Clinton's former rival Vermont Senator Childreny Sanders in the fight for the nomination of democrats in the presidential elections.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which investigates the use of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. authorities, considers that Russia's commitment to the cyber attack is almost beyond doubt.
Macartney: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartney acknowledged that Joko Ono's presence created a sense of danger for the legendary group "The Beatles".
A 74-year-old rock star now maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the deceased John Lenon, but while she went to visit the group to the record studio she frightened because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Stear, Lennon and Macartney.
When asked about both relationships, he replied to the magazine Rolling Stone: "They are really good."
We felt threatened at that time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on boosters.
Most of the groups could not tolerate it.
We were able, but not quite successful, because we were very tense.
We didn't have sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the record studio, they allowed us to work.
When John started to meet Joko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the midst of our four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with a former member of the group Ringo, and at times confirms the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise "The Beatles" has "completed its operation".
When asked if he was still meeting the second only member of the legendary rock group, Macartney said to Rolling Stone: "Frequently no."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, and I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Speak to me what everyone says, because I can't have a sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see your pet die.
The company now works so that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once an inhabited planet
Based on the latest climate patterns of NASA, Venus has once been an inhabited planet.
Researchers at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore Venus’s history, using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, has no water, and whose atmosphere is almost carbonic, had once been similar to the earth’s.
Scientists have previously mentioned that Venus’s slow rate of rotation is explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus has ever had a plan, a earthlike atmosphere, and has slowed down.
The model also looks at Venus’s former topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on the earth, but there have been enough water and geographical diversity on the planet to create life and to prevent steaming.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus spinning model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release by GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes a rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds, acting as a umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
This results in a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model represents Venus’s history, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it has once been inhabited, for several billions of years Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were evaporated, and its spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water was completely evaporated, only the thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas, Venus, which we know today, remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from "Avalanche" coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy, the coach of "Avalanche" Colorado and vice-president of hockey operations, submitted an apology to the team's decision-making process as a reason to mention the lack of influence.
The vice-president and general manager of Colorado Joe Sakik confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful in carrying out my duties as the chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado Club's hockey operations," says the 50-year-old Roy.
During this summer I have thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the necessary glory and achieve a higher level of performance.
To achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and the vice president of hockey operations must be fully consistent with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
The man who hired Paradise on May 23, 2013 thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Says Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and we wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with "Avalanche" team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received Jack Adams' award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion games Colorado team was defeated by Minnesota hockeys. Since then, the club has not been in the exclusion games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the "Wild" team without receiving the second special invitation of Western Conference organisers.
The famous Hall Gatekeeper, Roy, won four Cups of Stanley in his career - two with Montreal "Canadien" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and strike strike
Workers' strikes on the salaries of employees of the North Sea oil platform have been carried out, as both parties to the dispute have resumed their negotiations and are told by the negotiating leaders.
Periodicly, there are strikes on Nordic oil platforms, where Royal Dutch Shell operates, against Wood Group.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of Wood Group and United and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, with the aim of re-examineing the issues at stake.
Trade unions have announced that their recent activities, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are countering the planned wage cuts of 30 per cent.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced salaries for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced ground workers' wages by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, in turn, already reduced salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of falling oil prices, and the situation is even more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, a Scottish MEP, Dave Anderson, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea was vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explained that the North Sea and the country as a whole needed an economy that would benefit all and not individual individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost USD 1.4 billion, compared with USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler-sized star speed in the Pleyade constellation.
The latest mission of Kepler’s telescope has helped astronomers to gather the fullest catalog of star speed in the Pleyade constellation.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in this star are turning at various speeds, as well as how the speed of the stars is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system," Pasadena Caltech Infrasarkano Process and Louis Rebula, the analyst at the Analytical Centre, said in the news release.
The beach star is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to grow to about 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
With the maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When the wind arrives in the magnetic field of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the stars age, their speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a well-known area of stars, such as sun spots.
The latest star speed catalogue shows that larger stars are moving at a slower rate than smaller stars.
The rebul compares stars with dancers, the larger dancers perform pyrutes more slowly than the small dancers.
Rebuls says that Plejade's "ballet" shows that slowly rotating objects are bigger and more massive, while rather rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Pleyade star is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare star characteristics with spin speeds.
Rebuls says that the Pleyade star helps to create theoretical patterns for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of the stars and their complete stopping process slow down.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of Pleiade’s star speed in three new publications that will shortly be published in the Astronomy Journal.
