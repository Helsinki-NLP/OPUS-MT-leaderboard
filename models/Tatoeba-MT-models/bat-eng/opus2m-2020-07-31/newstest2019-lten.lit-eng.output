The hearing was opened on the evidence of the accused.
During the last hearing, the new Judge of Š. Gustainis, appointed by the State, Aleksandras Doroševa told the Chamber of Judges before he was able to get acquainted with the case-file.
Then the lawyer of MG Baltic Linas Belevičius stated that in order to ensure the full defence of a person, the judicial panel must allow the new lawyer access to the case-file and asked him to postpone the hearing.
"To ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the criminal case file.
It's not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroševa, pointed out that he had never been able to get acquainted with the accused act or with all the case-file.
At the previous hearing, the suspect, Š. Gustainis, informed against his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Sound recordings were also heard during the meeting.
The accused's lawyers were offended that the audio records submitted to the court were of poor quality.

It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand euros. E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros.
Labour party is suspected of bribery and trade influence, Liberals Movement - bribery, trade influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and trading these parties.
It is suspected that politicians discussed bribes with the vice-president of MG Baltic concern R. Kurlanski, and later in the Seimas or other institutions proposed or supported initiatives that were favourable to the concern.
Ethics guardians: Board of Liberals Movement on the Right of the Vilnius Unit
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the articles of association," the head of the BNS reported after the meeting of the commission, Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
"Our decision wasn't something new.
The Commission's interpretation has already been made in July, when the issue of the Paugiauai and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, by virtue of the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that a section may behave as it wishes - go to the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all the departments will form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the Management Board, then there is a possibility to stop membership and go to the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further steps.
On 17 October, the Board of Liberals Movement of the Party repealed the decision of Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections, not with the list of party, but with a new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party’s articles of association and decisions of the board.
By 31 October, Vilnius Section had to cancel its aspirations to participate in municipal elections with a list of committee.
But the department didn't do that.
Former Head of Unit Parliamentary Armonaitė has already left the Liberals Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberals Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to seek another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He left the lot too.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next March.
In the village of northern India, the villagers had a tractor hit by a tiger, which had previously ripped a man, and the officials reported on Monday.
The forest supervision officer, Mahavir Kaugžlagi, said that when the tigers dragged a man who worked in the fields late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, while the mother tried to get out, took her by a tractor.
The residents say that this tiger also attacked a young man about 10 days ago.
The mentioned village is located in the Dudhwa tiger reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the capital of Utar Pradesh in Laknau.
It shall be prohibited to galvanise tigers in protected areas.
The director of the reserve, Rameshas Pandey, said that under the Law on Wildlife Protection, the case would be reported to the police.
In April, in the Nighasan district of Utar Pradesh, the villagers beat another tiger, which suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, the tigers are considered to be a endangered species.
Last year’s government figures show that during the previous three years, at least one person died every day during a collision with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has been gradually increasing since India launched its tiger protection programme in the 1980s, where reserves were established in national parks and the fear of the big cats started to be a crime.
Although the methods for calculating tigers have changed, the census would show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers has grown to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be labelled with a microchip.
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other Members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, where it is proposed that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips and that their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 all dogs and cats will be labelled free of charge, and in 2020 they will be paid for their care and costs," Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, said.
Amendments to the law aim to resolve the systematic need for the labelling of pet animals.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible livestock farmers, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that, on the basis of the expected average cost of providing the microchip and the service, which will amount to around EUR 5 a transitional period, all owners of animals will be compensated for.
The total cost of labelling of pet animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to spread over three years and to reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is expected that funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through the special programme of municipal environmental protection support, the income of which will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and reallocation of funds.
These funds will be available to municipalities not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Mažeika, compulsory labelling practices are common in almost all countries of the European Union, which makes it possible to protect the animals themselves, because those who are lost can easily be returned to their owners, and save the time spent by livestock farmers themselves, who have to spend a lot of time and money to find a lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling is an obligation to care responsibly for the animal throughout its life.
The previous proposals for mandatory labelling were opposed because the programmes concerned were offered for financing by the population.
"The model now being presented should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection through increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to be labelled not only by veterinarians, but also by public figures, i.e. persons from animal care establishments who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the project authors say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different parliamentary groups – Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbravas, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Women lying better" star actress B. Arsobaitė is persecuted by liars
It is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-faced actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already received several roles related to liars.
At first, "Women are lying better", then the performance "Melages" and, finally, the comedy "Melags".
In this film, Brigita plays an eloquent wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I loved filming in "Melagies" because more I am a theatre actress and I have rarely appeared in the film.
A wonderful team of colleagues has promised an excellent result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the ground was the puppy Sunny!
Throughout my life, I thought that if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never admired those little, decorative fifs four.
But when Sunny was filming, she's so attached to me that the smile became mutual and I even wanted to buy it from my master, but failed," the actress smiled.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" that was produced by Lithuanian film hits "Unexperied" and "Along with our boys..." producer Paul Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas is entering the perimeters of comical and intriguing family members.
Your beloved just told me she's waiting.
It would be great news, but your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't tell everyone the good news, your parents suddenly say they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise you even more, for no one was expected to be such an atomic unit.
All the heroes are not as they looked at at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy "Melagiai" a good mood will be presented to viewers by the four-time film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larissa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Melagai" - in the Chinese since 9 November.
Deciding whether EUR 100 million of unpaid taxes were written off
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the law on declaration of residence prepared by Ramūnas Karbuskis, the leader of "states".
56 Seimas Members voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions abstained.
Further consideration of amendments will be undertaken by the Seimas on or after 6 December upon receipt of the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who did not declare their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, over three years, one person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000 people.
Social Democratic Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way, the Seimas would "encourage some people to abide by their obligations" - declare their departure and then not charge any taxes.
The Conservative member of the Health Committee, Antanas Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that they come to Lithuania for medical treatment by paying a low health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay the tax.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered to have left Lithuania, and "Sodra" will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mr Sinkevičius, the head of the Sodra, has previously said that such a step will make life easier for emigrated people and activities of Sodra.
A video on the Internet about a slipper reveals a serious problem
On a filter of how the mother’s bear climbs on a steep snowy slope, while the baby is getting up, slipping down, and relentlessly climbing.
The video has received numerous reviews and comments.
People were admiring the perseverance of the little bear - he went down many times and went back to his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but a little one does not try to give up and finally achieve his goal.
The video is truly a matter of concern, but it also reveals the danger that humans pose to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wild nature may sometimes be harmful.
"I can see that the bear drone has been terrified.
Their movements show that they're panicous.
If drones were not carried around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or would have done so more slowly or carefully.
This is an excellent example of how drones should not be used," said ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, along with his colleagues, studied how drones affect the bear.
The animals were fitted with cardiac instruments.
When drones came near, some bears fled, while others fled, but their hearts began to beat more often.
Scientists advise drones to be used responsibly to film animals, not to fly too close, not to raise noise, and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The escaped president came to the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the forced President, Viktor Yanukovych, who left Russia, to attend the hearing on his alleged betrayal of the state in an unusual manner - the call was published in the Official Journal.
At the court's call, published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj courier, a former leader is invited to attend a hearing on criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych has the right to participate in the video meeting.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court declared its final debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
The Russian lawyer, Aleksandras Gorošinskis, was given the opportunity to register with the foreign lawyers' register until November 19, so that he could attend a meeting where V. Janukovyčius is expected to speak his last word on video.
With the support of the Kremlin, Janukovyčius was forced down and fled to Russia during the Mayidan Uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine had been taken to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and later, in the east of the country, there was a war between Kiev and Russia supported separatists.
Since then, the battles have resulted in the lives of about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.

According to the party, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of the Vilnius Conference of the TS-LKD Divisions, became the leader of the Conservative List.

Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Limitations on Cogenerative Power Plant Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CJN) against the ruling of the governing bodies to adopt a law on the possibility to suspend the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Union of the Homeland of the Seimas-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that the group of Seimas Members had applied to the CT to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on the Management of Waste with the Constitution.
"Parliaments emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to question existing waste incineration plant projects, by entrusting the Government with the establishment of new restrictions (20 km from the residential territory) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," the report states.
"Parliaments note that in view of the way the law defines the prohibition on the construction of facilities of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of "residential territory" is defined), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of Lithuanian residents in the country, it would be practically impossible to construct such facilities throughout the territory of the country," it is added.
We claim that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CJ has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and effects which arose before the entry into force of the new act.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards on the basis of an undefined criterion.
Such regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security and the protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," the appeal stated.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of the co-generation plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
After the suspension of current projects, the state would not only suffer the 100 million financial losses, huge losses incurred by the Lithuanian population - increase the heating price and increase environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of landfilling of waste.
Members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberals Movement, the Social Democratic Group and the Senior Deputy of the ruling Working Group of Social Democrats Algirdas Butkevičius signed an address to the CT.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provided for the right of the Government to suspend the construction of the cogenerative power plants already under way, and also established a zone of 20 km from residential "quarantine" for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law repeatedly adopted by the Seimas will enter into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the Government's right to stop projects already started is not planned to be abandoned.
The CT will deal with this case in order of order - not earlier than one year later.
Publicising questions in LeBron James' statistics at Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Lakers Club in Los Angeles is not what he, organisation and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped rumors to emerge because of the possible dismissal of the coach Luke Walton.
However, such talks were encouraged by the president of the basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who stated that he would not forgive the coach, but that it would be better to play.
The biggest star of the team, Mr James, should also turn to himself.
Although the statistics of the attacker are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 recovered ball and 7.7 result transmission.
But she does not tell the truth.
In the first ten season's matches, other figures have also emerged showing that Lakers is playing better when there is no James on the square.
The player is unfavorable +/- statistics showing how many more points the crew goes or is missing when there are certain players on the square.
Here, when Mr James is on the square, Lakers spent 30 points this season more than the rivals.
As he sat on the bench, the "ežerūnai" scored 19 points more than the rivals.
At the moment, the Lakers Western Conference is just going to the 13th place, but several victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister L. Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO Air Policing and Air Policing missions in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai in May-August this year.
Spain will also contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were held between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
L. Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its Embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in the integrity of a man and law enforcement
"To me, it was the most unbelieving thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, it may be that the ministry carries out the work that it is required to perform.
Each one of us is doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action by him should be taken," V.Ačienė said.
R. Ača was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that as the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration he took a high-value bribe, and in exchange he could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus park managed by the municipality.
Private company representatives are suspected of having bought R. Ača directly or having been involved in masking bribes for various financial operations.
In April this year, R. Ača, the Council of the District of Raseiniai, dismissed R. Ača from the office of Head of Administration after a third attempt of distrust expressed.
The former "Gardian" became a member of the newly established Gediminas Kirkill-led Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party this March, he suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
Mr Ačas was unsuccessful in his mayor's election several years ago as a representative of the electoral committee 'Your Raceiniai'.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to stand up for his candidacy in the Raseiniai mayor elections next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union; she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says that she is waiting for further action by law enforcement - this will depend on whether she will withdraw from work in the commission.
"I really don't do this today, this week, I think I'll make a decision.
I will see if there is a need, what accusations are made, of course, I will make one or the other decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time is set for my seats," she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, representative of opposition Conservatives at the Seimas, invited the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Franckietis and the Head of the "States" to separate Ramūnas Karbauskas from the statements of the group colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring it to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She says that further work by V. Ačienė at the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would "encouraged public distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission".
The fun Coldplay music attracts famous Lithuanian couples

Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved group that has released seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
In two decades the group has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy.

Dalia Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favourable investment climate for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate the conditions of foreign imports.
By opening a trade and investment forum at the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, President Grybauskaitė stressed that, when we see signs of economic slowdown, the overall goal of Europe and China should be to 'unite our efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world', which is at the root of the tensions caused by trade wars, 'production surpluses and unfair competition'.
'The European Union has a very important commitment from China to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and secure here, as well as strengthening protection of intellectual property," said President Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening-up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that the transparency of investments must be 'higher than any business group'.
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict respect for international treaties - this must be essential to the environment of new investment relations," President Grybauskaitė underlined.
'Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries,' she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently holds 25th place among export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50%, amounting to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some of the officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could lead to undesirable political influence, while Beijing's special attention to Eastern Europe splits the unity of the EU.
Difficulty in solving: mobile signature service already running

Lion Air plane disaster unveiled: the anger of the loved ones killed
The black box of Lion Air’s broken Indonesian airline shows that at least four of its last flights had a speed counter malfunction, and the researchers reported on Monday.
The Chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK) Soerant Tjahjon said that a similar scream occurred during the last four aircraft flights, including the fatal when the liner fell in the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after rising from Jakarta.
During this disaster, a total of 189 people were killed on board.
A lot of the media reported malfunctions during a previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," said Mr Tjahjon during the press conference.
"Black box data showed that during two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem," he added.
"In the social networks there are many rumors.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data have remained) about four flights where there have been problems with speed meters in the air," the Head of the NTSK pointed out.
During the meeting with the members of the families who had died, Mr Tjahjon said that the information of the flight recorder was in line with the reports that the aircraft had changed its speed and height in the event of the last flight.
The search team has not yet found a second black box recording the conversations in the flight deck.
Lion Air indicated that the technical failure resulting from the flight between Bali and Jakarta had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak at a meeting with the Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, the moderator of the family members, with officials supervising the search for the remains of aircraft and victims and the investigation of the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grievous family members demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, establish Lion Air in 1999, present himself.
Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man who presented himself as the father of the passenger, Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane went.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never met me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion.
Following this meeting, Mr Kirana hastened away, avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identification of the dead.
Almost 140 corpses, loaded with remains of people, have been handed over to police medical experts.
To date, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives asked why, two months ago, the liner was allowed to fly, although during the 28th October flight from Bali to Jakarta there was a breakdown, among other things, resulting in the passengers' fear of a sudden decline in the plane immediately after the rise.
Lion Air said that this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to get up again.
These bad technicians must respond according to the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tjahjon said that the large number of small debris and the fact that the debris spread in a rather small area show that the liner was probably running into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was single when it fell into the sea.
He didn't explode in the air, and the aircraft engines, when he touched the water, were operating in big turns - this is shown by all the broken turbine blades," the officer explained.
Lion Air liner collapse is the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died when Garuda plane crashed near Medan.
After the crash, the rescue workers led: the minor was hit
On Monday evening on the road Vėžiai - Plungė, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz were faced at Tilviks.
The cars have been hit by a skull, and three people have been reported to be affected.
It is reported that BMW’s driver, who was born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road and that theft ran into a car called Mercedes-Benz, where Dad was born in 1967, and the daughter, who was born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firemen.
You know, you know, a girl in the Mercedes-Benz had to kill her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial facilitations to referendum
Following the approval by the Seimas of its proposal to reduce the referendum cartel for the first section of the Constitution with greater protection, the President will vetu amendments, says its advisor Mindaugas Linge.
"For the Constitution more than half of the population voted - this is a requirement.
This should certainly be at least a lower majority than its replacement, especially for the items contained in its first section.
It is easy to predict that the President would really veto the radio," said Dalia Grybauskaitė's internal politicians on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental elements of the State - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the State, so that by reducing the number of votes required to replace these articles, Mr Linge said, a 'negative precedent' would be created and 'distributed' to unmanageable risks.
"The President felt that there was no need for artificial facilitations, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people," he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas shall plan to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote approve this during the referendum.
At present, the Articles of Section One and Section Fourteen of the Constitution may be replaced by a referendum by more than half of all citizens entitled to vote.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas confirmed in September the President's veto on previously adopted amendments to the parliament which weakened the voting requirements by replacing Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution with citizenship.
It is proposed that the referendum be reduced in the run-up to the double citizenship referendum, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of their independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently, with some exceptions, have dual citizenship.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that the referendum would not happen under the current conditions – enough people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "Brush" therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to develop and therefore it needs to be updated, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already falling because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it is not even included in far-reaching planning, it is the minimum we must do", said Mr Masiulis at the Transport Conference organised by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the external airport of Klaipeda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the road, rail integration, construction of an external port in Klaipėda, the organisation of airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We have to stay awake, we have to start projects now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time," the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr Masiulis repeated that there has been too little funding available for road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of roads is not improving yet, because funds are not being made available enough.
We are planning to build new roads, but even basic care, such as motorways, is lacking.
We must set the amount to be allocated to road surveillance if we want their situation to improve," Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport sector services exports grew by 18.6% this year, while Germany, bypassing Russia, became the largest export market.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, according to which EU carriers will be required to return their trucks periodically to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, it is absurd to offer to to tow trucks a permanent return to their homes, as empty trucks, fuel combustion and emissions would increase in Europe.
Most of this will be achieved by railways, as costs will increase so that part of the transport will pass on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with guardians of heritage
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced to the Seimas Committee on Economics that he started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of Vilnius Airport's building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CPD), called the deliberations of Mr. Masiulis a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950 ’ s is a value that was entered in the register in 1993 and not for politicians, but for specialists to decide to remove it.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"The extraction of this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you get to Vilnius to feel in a modern country, and not as interesting, really unrepresenting our country as an innovative one," said Mr. Masiulis in the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with Rail Baltica’s track while building an underground station.
This transport unit should be operational in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year expected 4.8 million passengers and next year – 5 million.
Kaunas Airport handled 1.2 million passengers last year.
What do Lithuanian troops do in Afghanistan?

Next year start direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest scheduled passenger aircraft Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bese, which belongs to Madagascar, based on information from the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, writes the "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose between 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday route will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowski, Director General of Itaka Lietuva, states that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators also prepared new holiday routes for the 2019 summer season.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister for Finance on the potential crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
"For more difficult times, we always have to prepare.
What I wish to welcome is that for the first time in Lithuania's history we have accumulated reserves for the third year in a row.
But it is also very important - not to talk about illness", said Mr Shapoka during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister for Finance and Vice-Minister Miguel Tusskienė attends meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, since some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on the taxation of income generated from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States pending a global consensus.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) by the euro area countries.
On 23 October, the EC rejected Italy's draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC is taking advantage of this opportunity.
Further information is requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss deepening Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that ESM functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian Labour Traditions and Traditions
More recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of a famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural meticulist, ethnographer and national researcher Balis Burač (1897-1972) in Sidarai, the city of Šiauliai.
As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the lifeless national rebirth has brought together many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Burachus - Bali, Jonas, Broni - from the very depth of the village, we can involve all creative people in the promotion, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
In more than 50 years, Balys Buračas has been travelling around his home country with a camera in his hands, presenting a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing straits of national culture and had a rare ability to comprehend the lasting value of his work.
In Balis Buračs' photographs, Lithuania's landscapes, mounds, and everyday and holiday environments, our people have decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in their national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burač's heritage for describing national work customs and related traditions and, above all, for their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the distinctiveness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite the two world wars and the difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in the works of the people of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, as well as their holidays and other descriptions of the traditions and customs of Bali Burač.
Over 400 rare photographs, mostly unpublished, have been selected from the remaining 10,000 negatives in museums and archives, which are grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are typical of the cappians, couches, and other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.
A suspect who fled from a police car in Panevėžys was locked in freedom for 4 hours

The tragic fate of the couple: only a few hours of marriage die
In the southwest of Texas, a helicopter disaster resulted in the death of a married couple in just a few hours.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his peer wife Bailee Ray Ackerman Byer died on Sunday shortly after midnight in the hill 16 km to the northwest of Juvaldy and 129 km to the west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Surprisingly, the disaster took place at a distance of about 30 miles [24 km], just as many as the newborns were years old.
The pilot of the helicopter, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the town of Hansville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Bylers family ran into a family - owned helicopter near Juvaldy and after the wedding feast.
The accident occurred when the helicopter ran about 30 miles [24 km] away.
The newlyweds were flying to the international airport of Sant Antonio, where they were planning to board the plane and fly for the honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
"This is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
For many years, Mr Lawrence has piloted the aircraft of that family.
According to Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should become clear what the pilot’s physical condition was and whether she could have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the take-off.
His ruins hung a wide radius on the rocky slope of the hill, while the hull remained "dangerously exposed", said the air safety researcher Craig Hatch of the National Transport Security Board (NTSB) during the press conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to take the debris and then take a thorough look at it, but it will not be easy for the tractor and the truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary NSB report should be published after two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran a "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu, a member of his party's Likud parliament, reported by his office.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), the United States has introduced particularly severe sanctions against Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran all the time when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the Head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, Israel's Minister of Defence, Avigdor Lyberman, said that the new sanctions would give a 'deciding' blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls 'the toughest sanctions of all time', were introduced following the decision taken in May by Mr Trump to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim at a significant reduction in Iranian oil exports, which has already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and at removing Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long been opposed to this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and time limits are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the abolition of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund the militia and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised to prevent it from taking a military stand there.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that, as has been envisaged, the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again dives the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The court will hear the witness's testimony in the case of the end of the accident in Vilnius, the Northern town.
On Tuesday, Vilnius Regional Court decided that in order to clarify all significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case will be heard at the next meeting on 26 November.
In the present case, a righteous judgment has already been delivered, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On the 22nd of August Vilnius City District Court justified the car driver due to the death of the motorcyclist’s accident, declaring 79-year-old Eduard Osipov that the motorcyclist was driving in the city at a high speed and committed a gross violation.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office requests the annulment of the decision of the district court and claims that E. Osipov is the most guilty of the accident, while the conclusions of the district court are not justified.
A lawyer from the family of a motorcyclist who has died is also applying for the annulment of the judgment.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, at about 15.00, when the car "Škoda Fabia" driven by E. Osipova came from Lakūnai Street to the street of Žirmūnai and faced a motorbike on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused a man that the driver of a car had violated the Road Traffic Rules, which were intended to give way to the road, and caused a traffic accident - he died on the main road of a man who was driving a motorcycle "Piaggo".
The initial police reports indicate that the driver of the motor vehicle died, but after the investigations it was found that the vehicle is equivalent to a motor cycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, the judge of Vilnius City District Court, has said that experts have found that the driver of a motorcycle was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although permitted speed at that place is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the driver of a decent old car claimed to have driven at a speed of just 5-6 miles per hour.
The driver who saw the obstacle tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor's office believes that Mr Osipov, who was driving from side to main road, had to give way to a motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner employees were killed in Syria
The deaths include five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
The source of Novaja Gazeta announces this in Syria.
According to the source, one of the 5th Syrian military units has been deployed in the said territory, with many Syrian volunteers and "military recruits".
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information on Russian fate.
A former king of Belgium will have to undergo a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory of artist Delphine Member.
Since 2013, she has sought to be recognised as a child of a former monarch.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Seys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies paternity.
According to the data of the station RTBF, he can apply to the Supreme Court for DNA analysis.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Member, the former man of the mother of Delphine, is neither the father of the artist, nor the father of the artist, in either biological or legal terms.
Delphine applied for the relevant investigation in order to be recognized as the daughter of "Tikro's" father Albert.
WRC parties will distribute money, but they will not give anything to the social workers
This week the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
This spring, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by the Vice-President of Parliament Gediminas Kirkilo, is not yet planning to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the GRC if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to lots changes.
Laura Matošityte, President of the GCC, informed the GCC that "this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled for a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly budget to the parties".
According to the French authorities, the decision on this issue must be taken by the public authorities by 15 November.
It is planned to allocate EUR 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Union of the Homeland - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of the State and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Party of Social Democrats - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Alliance of Liberals - almost EUR 0.4 million, the parliamentary party without a political group - about EUR 0.23 million, and the recent party of Order and Justice - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in parliament, but neither the ruling nor opposition campaign of the Polish elections - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the current law, which will guide the GRC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect money from the budget.
For this party has not yet participated in any election.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros in the run-up to the next three elections - self-governing, the President and the European Parliament.
The respective amendments adopted by the Seimas to the political parties and the budget laws of this year were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the ruling representatives Mr Kirkilas and the peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis believe that the parliaments will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do this before this Thursday's meeting of the CoR, so, according to Mr Matšaitytė, "grants will be allocated according to the legal order that has existed so far".
However, the Head of the GPC did not reject the fact that if the Seimas rejected the President's veto and the new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to parties this week, the Commission may consider granting an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account all existing legal environment when making the decision, because we are the executive body, which is responsible for implementing the laws adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and new laws would enter into force, according to them, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties upon borrowing the corresponding amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Proshenko: The clients of the activist Handziuk murder must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be examined very carefully in accordance with the examination procedures.
As President, I have no opportunity and I do not have to obtain any information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that it was in the best interest of all that the murder of Handziuk be clarified and that murderers, perpetrators and clients of the crime "take the necessary responsibility".
'After this case has been requalified to the murder (the case), they are quite rightly and rightly threatened with the execution of life imprisonment,' the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly referred to the public's demand for an open and impartial inquiry into the case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of the representatives of the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whatever they may be'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would make everything even more confused.
"I call on all the forces, both the authorities and the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast, so that public confidence can be built up.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation in the country to destabilise," he said.
In July, Mr Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked by acid in the town of Cherson.
She was a advisor to this mayor of southern Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died in the hospital on Sunday.
In the absence of clarification by the police and prosecutors of the perpetrators of this attack, on Tuesday the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, presented his resignation statement.
After her death, public officials were accused of failing to carry out a proper investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and Minister of the Interior.
'I am making my resignation statement today,' reported Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament on his own study report.
Parliament still has to accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and of passing on important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced the toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional facilities to water - free facilities with the computer revolution of the 1970 ’ s.
The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, introduced a high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water supply in water pipes, said Reuters.
The toilet without water shall operate in accordance with the principle of solid and liquid waste separation.
Both types of waste water are recycled into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bille Gates quoted Bloomberg.
The technological toilet was created at the expense of a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Within seven years, the fund spent $200 million on a plant that could convert human waste into fertiliser or water.
In total, there were about 20 toilet models, as Bill Gates said.
Now the installation is complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Fund, 500 thousand children under five years of age die in the world because of poor sanitation conditions.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the spending on health, which already amounts to 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the health situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates has presented a glass with faeces to the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example "may include 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: human deaths are a concern
On Monday, the French health officials announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide in the face of concern over several dozens of recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The ANSES health agency announced that a decision to ban all products containing metam containing a pesticide was taken after a new safety test started earlier this year before at least three poison waves started in September in the Department of Art and Loire.
In these cases, the government has already stopped using the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in the Anje region, where there is a large production of lettuce juice, complained of eye and throat stinging, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not accelerate it," said Francoise Weber, ANSES Deputy Director, on Monday.
Metama - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered by the US Environment Agency (US EPA) as a 'probable human carcinogen'.
This pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectgon, is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new security inspection is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice, but to remove it from the market, whether or not there are alternatives to it," said Mr Weber to that newspaper.
"We take care of the difficulties for salad juice growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their displeasure with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, near Nantes produces more than half of the 35 000 tonnes of lettuce juice consumed each year in Europe.
The next season there will be "a lot less saladd broth, skates and pores" last month, when the government stopped using metam, Philippe Retier, head of the Nantes Breeders' Federation, told AFP.

President Paul Biya was sworn to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after the ‘controversial elections’
During a ceremony under the supervision of Parliament's Chairman, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, for 85 years, Biya promised to preserve the 'unity and unity' of the West African state.
The oldest President of Africa, who has been ruling his country for 35 years, has been announced as a winner in the 7th October elections, with 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were darkened by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the Inauguration of Mr. Biya, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at a presbitery school in the North Western region, where English-speaking separatists are engaged in an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, autonomy began to be demanded in the south-western province of North West and neighbouring South-West due to alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics.
In 2017, when Mr. Biya refused to give up, he radically announced an independent state, "the Republic of Amazon", and raised his weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilian and more than 175 security force officers were killed this year during attacks by separatists and government counter-measures.
More than 300 000 people have fled from violence: some have crossed the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-baby forests.
During the October elections in the North Western region, only 5% of voters voted and 15% of voters voted in the south-western province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya collected two thirds of the votes.
Pre-election of Conservatives: errors caused by inexperience
"Someplaces were missing - understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed them to use their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent," the politicians said.
According to him, the complaints were received, but their content is not substantially altered and the infringements themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"It was.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced - it was also a news for them.
So not all the actions were in line with our order.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC that the principles we described were respected.
Those complaints do not, however, give rise to any doubt as to the results," said Mr Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CCC, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - the ballot papers found in ballot papers have been cancelled without a stamp.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to Mr Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities relate to several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, because the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference to the results of the election," explained A. Anušauskas.
It is said that the activity of the party members in the elections amounted to 55%, while the activity of non-party voters was 69 percent.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday are also unchanged - 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted for Ingrida Šimonytė, while 21 percent (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušacka.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. Šimonytė's candidacy in May next year's presidential elections.
A brief says probably won't meet Putin in Paris
John Bolton, advisor on national security of the White House, said earlier that D. Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where the events of the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, when he went to the last summits before the US Congress mid-term election, Mr Trump announced that the journalists were not sure whether this would be an opportunity to meet the President of Russia.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," the President of the United States pointed out.
However, added by the leader of the White House, they will meet at the G-20 Summit and "probably many times will meet" after that.
Mr Trump continues to try to "reload" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia intervened in the 2016 US presidential elections.
Kęstutis Strupas asks to revoke the decision of the VTEK
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director General of Santa Rican clinics at Vilnius University, asks to repeal the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) - it recognised that the transactions have not been declared in due time and thus the law has been violated.
On Tuesday K. Strupas' complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant asks for the annulment of the decision of the VTEK on 23 May, BNS reported the representative of the court Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltadonė.
Mr Strupas believes that the gifts given to family members should not be declared, he claims that he understood the exception of the law.
In May of the VTEK announced that K. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, were then removed from Santara clinics, in violation of the provisions of the law on declaration of private interests.
During the investigation it was found that four transactions were declared in breach of the foreseen time limits: loan taken from the bank with the spouse, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, gift provided to the daughter in 2017 - apartment and loan granted and outstanding to the natural person with the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by passing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on Harmonisation of Public and Private Interest in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for the year.
The law obliges not only to declare their own data but also that of the spouse.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of Info TV TV information.
It has been clarified whether S. Strupas and his spouse, head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupienė have duly and timely declared their transactions.
Last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the above data were not mentioned in declarations of interest by the former head of the Santara clinics and his wife.
Legal protection K. Strupas, along with at least ten other persons, has made suspicions in corruption research - according to law enforcement, the purchase of successful public computers and software in clinics has demanded illegal financial compensation from companies, it has been disguised as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have negotiated at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in Santara clinics.
Mr Strupe himself denies his fault.
The suspected professor of corruption, K. Strupas, was dismissed from the position of Head of Santara clinics in September.
By a decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of the Republic of Lithuania, the representatives of the Santara clinics discontinued employment relations with K. Strupas at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be managed on a temporary basis by Professor Juozas Raistenskis, pending the competition to elect a new CEO, promising to announce it this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, who presented them on Monday at the forum "The Change of Educational Content: Foreign Experience in Decisions in Lithuania".
The Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke in the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating educational content in the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
"In the light of the results of the international student achievement study PISA, students' achievements are below the OECD average," said the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
According to OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the report of the Ministry of Education and Science, Lithuania is over-focused on the provision of knowledge and not on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuanian general education programs focus on student literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility development, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
Vice Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the volume of programs started this year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplines are more closely interrelated.
According to the Vice-Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare their unique educational content, the current system of student evaluation will change into a cumulative score, a higher weight will be gained and informally acquired student competences.
There are fewer standardised tests.
In view of the fact that general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, task bank.
Updating the content of education aims to improve students' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reducing the gap between pupils' achievements, acquiring modern competences in school and literating in various areas.
Lithuania is planning to allocate EUR 7.8 million of EU and state budget funds for the renewal of educational content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project will be tested in part of schools and will be implemented in all schools as of September 2021.
The Ministry received criticism at the beginning of October about EUR 8 million from the Development Development Centre of Education for the renewal of primary, basic and secondary education joint programmes.
For four years this is planned to be €7,8 million, and in early October the first purchase of €1.3 million was published, which sought to find the producers of educational programmes.
When the experts criticised this purchase, he was suspended, and J.Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science, dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, Director of Development Centre for Education.
Exercises in Lithuania to respond to the extreme flood
On Monday we start ten-day exercises to improve the institutional response to the extreme flood.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (PLD), the exercise will examine how state institutions are prepared to work in the country following a state-level emergency, such as flooding: to eliminate its consequences, coordinate search for people, rescue and immediate eviction from the flooded areas, organise their provision with drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other measures for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries and other institutions of the country will participate in the exercise, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operation centres.
On 5-13 November, the preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which the municipality, which has received information from the PRTD about the continuous precipitation and the beginning of the flood, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active exercise phase is planned for 14-15 November.
During this period, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and in state and municipal institutions – the Emergency Operations Centres of Institutions.
Upon the announcement by the Government of a state-level emergency due to the consequences of the flood, the commander of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the response to the emergency, the resolution of its consequences, measures of protection and rescue of the population and assets.
The Deputy Director of the PRT, Mindaugas Kanapickas, says that it is important to check in the exercise the institutions' readiness to perform the statutory functions, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to check how they are prepared to warn and inform the population about an imminent disaster, state and municipal institutions, institutions and enterprises, and to "improve emergency management skills of state institutions".
The exercise will also demonstrate the overall capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire brigades to pump a huge amount of water from the surrounding areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Resigned Prosecutor General of Ukraine Jurijus Lucenka
The Ukrainian Prosecutor General Jurijus Lucenka announced his resignation on Tuesday in the country's parliament due to the death of the acid-filled fighter Katerina Gandziuk, published by the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to the laws of Ukraine, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, and this must be submitted by a majority vote to the Supreme Rada for approval.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Lucenko presented the progress and results of law enforcement investigation into the murder order of K. Gandziuk in the Supreme Rada.
In his speech, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed the indignation that Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Mr Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption, who spoke publicly about police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On 31 July, K. Gandziuk was an unknown attacker on her home.
On November 4, she died of injuries in the hospital.
The protestors at the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine request an answer, who killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.
According to Mr Lucenko, in law enforcement research, 12 persons possibly related to the order of murder of Mr Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was the loss of media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leak of information, suspects received essential knowledge for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he personally knew Mr Gandziuk and was outrageous that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"When nobody has reason to say that someone is in power, I would like to state that I am making a declaration to resign.
I will present it today to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss it in Parliament," Mr Lucenko quotes the publication Obozrevatel in Rada.
It is written that Mr Lucenko added that 'does not allow the country to be double-government when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes that have been revealed'.
Mr Lucenko is considered to be a close friend of the country's President, Mr Petras Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following a long-standing attempt to remove his predecessor, Viktor Chokin, who was suspected to be the victim of corruption of the highest level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Ms Aurelija Vernickaitė, adviser to the Minister for Energy, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not achieve the overall trajectory of the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a share of renewable energy of 6% in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a number of difficulties, including rather high greenhouse gas emission reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly made up of biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a less important role at this stage.

On Tuesday after the submission, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered for an investigation by Agnė Širinskienė, the leading political influence.

Currently, the temporary committee of inquiry of the Seimas conducting a new investigation of political corruption has been instructed to explain possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this deadline by stating that "in public space significant information on possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared".
In the project, A. Širinskienė refers to "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by addressing the Constitutional Court or trying to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The reference to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition Conservatives.
The ruling 'states' have found that Conservatives have largely relied on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their applications.
I have an impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK), the leaders of the "states" are accused of the former co-worker Povil Urbšis.
According to them, the former chairman of the Committee of State Management and Municipalities of the Seimas could instruct the members of the State Administration and Municipalities to dismiss from office the former head of the Commission's Prevention Division Mindaugas Strairis.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to clarify the influence of the interested persons or groups, to the conduct of elections, to the formation of coalitions, to the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, to the activities and financing of party and public movements, to the legislative processes, to the election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities in their response.
The investigators should present their findings by 1 May of the following year.
The election campaign of the President, the European Parliament, will take place at the time.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "nationals".
Its members also appointed two social workers, one "orderist", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish election campaign – the Christian Family Union.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the chairman of the governing Lithuanian peasant and green union.
According to him, the investigation carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGC) during the previous part-session on the same subject matter showed that the investigation should be continued.
Head of Internal Intelligence in Germany lost post
Mr Maassen, a 55-year-old, even more instigated the control by stating that his problems were the fault of the 'radical left force' in the Merkel Coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised before, but forced to leave for the reserve.
Among other things, it became clear last weekend that, at the meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised the 'naive' immigration policy of Mr Merkel.
The German Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, who defended the head of intelligence for a long time at the press conference held on Monday, said that the recent comments by Mr Maassen were unacceptable and 'despite him personally'.
Mr Seehofer, who himself was under pressure from both this dispute and the poor presence of his party in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen to reserve.

Congenital girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A carnivorous girl with a white blowing bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can the white swan floating toward the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the "Didžio (r) evolution" show plus reality will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - to one of the girls of the project this evening, the tears of happiness will be on the filming ground, and her boyfriend will be on the scene.
"There are others who think that bigger girls don't get the attention or the attention of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but I like him, he doesn't require any standard figure from me," Aurika, a participant, will talk to the wedding dress before he shows.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it is a complex construction, it is rich in materials, dress heavy, inconvenient for movement.
Also, some women believe that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in herself.
I can assure you that a properly selected dress model really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The girl's fate in the project R. Kalinkinas is decided together with the entire commission - a fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskienė, a photographer and social media star Naglis Bieracs and a TV producer Laura Pute.
"As for the girl who has to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of curry among the members of the commission, because we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show in different ways.
The wedding dress demonstration task has been made even more difficult, and that - I can now reveal - has turned out to be two newcomers, which were certainly no worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," says R. Kalinkin.
The novelties - 23 years of scandalous behaviour in one summer reality show famous Ieva and the 31 years of exclusive beauty of the two children's mother Dovilė - just like other girls participated in the "Didžio (r) evolution" selection and got to the top 20.
Unfortunately, they had to say goodbye to the project after the first very open screening of girls on the streets of Vilnius city.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK audiences who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
Having received international recognition, there is already the second week of the show of the reality of the carnival beauty in Lithuania – here, plus the size of the girls compete for the name of the first in the country plus the size of the star.
So far, only eight of them have been left - and they all understand perfectly that only one will be able to win.
Intriguing and unpredictable week of reality show "Size (r) evolution" begins this Monday evening at 20:30 through the LNK.
Actor I. Elba has been chosen the most sexy man in the world
The US magazine People announced this year's most sexy man in the world.
It became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not find a laughter in the account of the new title.
I thought, "Don't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - laughing about the actor.
To be honest, Idris called it this title, it's a very pleasant feeling that won his ego.
The British star believes that he has often received abusive words and taunts, who made his childhood uneasy, because, as he says, he was "very high and rude".
The young actor did not please his peers and became an object of ridicule and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"As soon as I grew up my mustaches and my muscles became the toughest guy in my city district," Idris smiles.
When a man loses his pride in Ose screens, Elba works on disc jogging at parties held in Spain, and especially at rude Ibiza.
During leisure time, a man enjoys the boxing of Thailand and has a sense of fashion that he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor believes that the most important thing in the world is the family, so he plans a wedding with her fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd most sexy man in the world, chosen by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was handed over to Blake Shelton.

Managers no longer require a distance of 20 km for construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius CHP plant is under construction, near the Gariūnai market.
The managers no longer seek to maintain a 20 - mile [20 km] distance from their settlements when building a waste incineration plant.
Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the 'country' group, which previously supported the provision on a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika's amendment provides that from January 2019 waste incineration plants could be built according to the environmental and public health requirements set by laws.
He admits that the amendments were caused by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"In view of the definition of the area of residence, it is clear that such places where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the chairman of the committee said.
In October, the Governing Body opposed the President’s veto corrections to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the insurance of the construction of waste incineration plants close to 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for the permission of the Government to take decisions on the future of two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provisions do not propose any adjustment.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel-fired power plant is being built by the Lithuanian Energy Group and in Kaunas, together with Fortum Heat Lietuva company in the Finnish Energy Group.

The British and Irish leaders discussed on Monday the possible compromise on the complex Northern Ireland issue, which is the subject of the Brexit negotiations, reported by Dublin.
By telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the so-called 'insurance mechanism', which would allow the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland province to remain open border with the European Union.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In his interview, Mr May 'has raised the opportunity to review the mechanism of insurance measures', it states.
'Varadkar has made it clear that it is open to revision of new proposals, provided that the result of such revision is not related to a unilateral decision to terminate the restrictive measures,' the Government reports.
Brexit's negotiators cannot find an acceptable solution for avoiding checks at the UK and Ireland's land border when Britain withdraws from the single market and customs union next March.
Both sides agree on 'prohibition measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement has been signed to ensure that no additional customs controls at the border is carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied on a temporary basis to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Dominica Raab, the Secretary of Brexit, is seeking to allow Britain to withdraw from the Insurance Agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar said to journalists in Dublin that his government 'is unable to support this'.
"The three-month or limited term of insurance is not worth the paper to be written on," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed the report that has appeared in the Brexit negotiations since the weekend in Britain that the agreement is reachable by hand.
'I would say that we are making further progress in the negotiations, but there is still work,' said Mr May's representative in London.
The European Commission's representative, Margaritis Schin, also said to journalists: 'We are not yet there'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, published a declaration calling for the right to have reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas (Amarja Senas) and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer for the Nobel Peace Prize and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), and Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargas Lloza (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
'We are calling on the leaders of good will to take action on all continents to strengthen democratic models and open public debates, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts,' the Group's report says.
They argue that a 'global space for information and communication' is a common good which 'should be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of the truth of the obligation, the principles of pluralism of approaches and rational methods of establishing facts," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises 'unreal news', but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
The world leaders should take a stand on this matter when they meet at the Peace Forum in Paris on 11-13 November, which is called for by the signatories.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the direction of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, Head of the media freedom and the media protection organisation "Reporters without Borders" (RSF) based in Paris.
Other signatories include the former President of Senegal, Abdu Diuf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas has approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety which provide that penalties for product safety violations must be increased.
Amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Mr Vinkus, Member of the Seimas Committee on Health said, when talking about the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set concern better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is divided more fully and more specifically among all those involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because the entities that have paid the fines continue to commit repeated infringements," said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and supplemented by proposals by the Seimas Economic Committee after approval of the Government.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer rights protection, give more powers to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of supervision of requirements and compliance with product safety.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product and thereby ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the public control of product safety by the market surveillance authorities did not grant access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of producers and suppliers, which would make it more difficult for the authorities to do so.
According to the Ministry's assessment, the six-month period for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect the infringement, carry out an investigation and impose a fine.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law – in 2017 alone they made 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed that manufacturers be obliged to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify the suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to have access to the market, territory, buildings, premises and inspections of economic operators which manufacture, supply, supply, operate and perform public product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the amount of the fines for infringements of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now between EUR 144 and 14,48) shall be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has made available them on the market, provider of dangerous services or provider of services.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SCHR) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between EUR 868 and 4 344) would be imposed.
Without the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between EUR 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and 25 000 (now between EUR 5 792 and EUR 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (minimum amount of the fine has not been set), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.
Ten years of age had a baby: a family member was raped
In Colombia, millions of people were shocked.
A 10 - year - old girl who was raped by an older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world through the caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For some time, they were under medical supervision.
There's still some time before the young mother and the baby leave home.
"On the basis of the information I received from the police, the baby became pregnant after having been sexually exploited by a brother member of the family," told one of the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted.
The police investigate an event of rape and violence against the child.
Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in remote and remote areas
The Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of Oslo, the country’s capital.
This is part of the NATO Trishake Connector 2018 exercise - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most troops from the second battalion of the Norwegian military have spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands, after the 11th of September terrorist attacks.
But they are most skilled in fighting in the Arctic conditions, and these skills are particularly useful now when NATO changes its direction.
In recent days, soldiers have been involved in staged battles against real British soldiers in the mountains east of Tynesth, often in the outermost and harshest areas.
The soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wild nature, but in the harsh climate they have to stretch a much higher weight on their shoulders - one bag weighs about 50 kg.
The troops who have settled in the camp say that they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which like no other like real warfare, will teach them how to be ready if there is a serious threat.

A retired Kaunas vice-center doesn't plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice-President Povilas Mačiulis, who has left work in the municipality for support to Vygaudas Ušacks presidential elections and the United Kaunas organization, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time on the family," said Mr. Mačiulis in BNS.
He also said he was not going to take part in the next municipal elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ušacks after losing the initial elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"If openly, we haven't been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about the plans for the future.
It is obvious that when Vygaudas left the next election battle, this stage of my life is over," said Mr. Māčiulis.
He said that he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy with regard to support to V. Ušackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost its unique opportunity to have a real leader in international relations".
Mr. Mačiulis worked briefly as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to this position after successful election of "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudit Lickei" and several more companies.
Workers are breaking up in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
When Kaunas residents noticed the workers who were breaking in Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the reconstruction of the surviving tower was finally taking place.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Sužiedelis believed that there were works on changing the protective roof cover of the south-west tower with a piece of protective wall.
According to the speaker, the roofs will be cans.
"In an emergency, worn-out can covering threatened others - people could fall and hurt - so it was necessary to change it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also detrimental to heritage," explained the director of the museum.
Will these rooftops be like those of centuries ago?
"All works are coordinated with the institutions of heritage," G. Šežiedėlis added those who want the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side - roofs must protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when working with heritage.
Prior to that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in the can as early as the Soviet era, so they had no historical value anymore," the director of the Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The employment contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum taught the expectations.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost 24 thousand EUR.
This amount, according to the speaker, was provided for in this year's budget.
The works in Kaunas Castle are performed by the company "Statia".
Kaunas Day.lt has written, as the research has been carried out, Kaunas Castle could have seemed earlier.
The U.S. and South Korea have renewed their Navy Exercise
Now, for two weeks, military fleet exercises with about 500 troops will take place in the southern town of Pohang, reported by the Ministry of Defence in Seoul.
There are 28,500 soldiers in South Korea.
Both countries have been developing joint military maneuvers for many years, which Pyongyang calls 'provocative' and 'preparing for invasion'.
On Friday, North Korea threatened to renew its nuclear programme if Washington did not lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change in the course could be "seriously considered", stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the TV that the criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up the nuclear weapon.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korea's envoy Kim Yong Cholu in New York this week.

The Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two significant U.S. brain centres
According to Linas Kojala, the head of EESC, who is based in Vilnius and counting the 13th year of activity, networking in the USA will allow to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice heard more widely on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise, because the topics of NATO analysis, security, disinformation, and the development of the Eastern Partnership countries are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the EESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for transnational projects, exchange expertise and visits to experts.
This should be of particular benefit to Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost one hundred top analysts.
FPRI took the seventh place in its category in the latest global ranking of analytical centres at the University of Pennsylvania.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were invited to consult and work with the highest political institutions in the United States, is starting ten in the same rating.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the information space of the USA and encourage us to raise the quality cartel up", added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the forthcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision-makers and public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre shall operate on the basis of implemented projects and shall not be maintained for targeted grants.
EESC partners implementing joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
When two buildings were destroyed on Monday in the southern city of Marseille, two people were injured easily, reports the fire service.
As the buildings fell down, there was a ruin on the street, and the clouds of dust rose.
Tens of firemen worked at the site of the event near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.
