Assembly Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility to "be perceived as ticks"
Some members of the Assembly were concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (MEmber of the Wales Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM is concerned throughout the political spectrum that it can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party AM explained that their group is concerned about "remote with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: "twp" means "single-right" and "pwp" means "cache".
Lots of Plaid AM indicated that none of the group "was not satisfied" and has recommended alternatives.
The representative of Wales Conservatives admitted that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that MWP was very similar to Muppet, meaning "light".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the Walesan letter "w" is spoken in a similar way to the English-language Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft laws to change the title, said: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the Assembly members themselves."
The Government of Wales’s Act of 2017 gave the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, which received broad support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the name of AM, the Commission preferred Wellsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the greatest support in the public consultation.
The AM clearly recommends alternatives, but the fight for an agreement can be a headache for Assembly Speker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of the AM on how they will be called will take place once they have discussed the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on the change of state name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The people's vote was held to resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour creates an impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscieta, declared that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a matter for the EU and NATO to join.
St. Mārtiņš church calls to keep quiet, while the churches of Harlem fight for existence.
"As told by the old people I've talked to, earlier on every corner there was a bar and church," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there's no one else."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bar there are no longer the living rooms in the neighbourhood, which people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he is concerned that the money that he receives when he sells the property will end faster than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point".
The church, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments that will accommodate people who will not help the rest of the temples in the area.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and so the day will come near, when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that most people who will enter these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the black metropolis, the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martina 10 years later.
The original white methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, who worshipped God near him.
The church of St. Martins took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. On 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, he led a boycott of a working retailer who refused to hire or give them promotions in black.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but since Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing to David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to the St. Martin's congregation, proudly called the call game "the calls of the poor".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a bigger call game in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather told me that the congregation of St. Mārtiņš did not replace him.
The events around St. Mārtiņš church in the past few months reflected knotted relations between architects and builders, some of which were attracted by secular power and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
In July, the church council, which is made up of secular leaders, addressed the diecesis in writing with concern that the diecesis "will try to pass the costs on to the council", although the council has not been involved in hiring the architects and builders sent by the diecesis.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese activity.
Shark wounded 13-year-old adolescents in the lobster fishing area
The shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy in California on Saturday and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services told.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends on Saturday morning had niris about half an hour when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then with the group fell down to him to help him get the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought it was just a thrill about the lobster he caught, but then he "understood that the boy shouted "I was saying!
It hurts me!"
The whole bone of his key was broken," Hammel said, who immediately noticed it when he came to the boy.
"I yell that everyone leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by air to the Raddy Children’s Hospital in Sandwich, where his condition was considered critical.
The attack species are unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, informed the media that sharks had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not recognised as a dangerous species for humans.
He added that the victim was injured by the upper part of the torso.
The officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Ensinitas for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for security reasons.
Jails pointed out that more than 135 shark species are present in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK beauty industry market
Sainbury's is attacking Boots, Superdrug and Debenham with a series of beauty products and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion and household items are decreasing, 11 shops in the country will try larger shelves of beauty products and, if everything goes well, there will be more such shops next year.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for the possibility of using shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's informed that I would double my offer in the beauty industry up to 3000 products, including such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maycelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in "Boots" stores.
The supermarket also remarkets its Boutique decorative cosmetics line, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly — increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the scent wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try the concession in two Sainbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, while the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to small food purchases every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainbury's, has said that sales outlets will become more and more similar to all-purpose stores, as the chain of shops is trying to deal with discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos shopping sites in several hundred stores and has opened several Habita since he bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved the sales of goods and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceuticals divisions ended with defeat.
Sainbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute on how to distribute the proceeds from pharmacy shops in supermarkets.
The new strategy is evolving after 3 years ago, Sainsbury's sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
According to this plan "Lloyds" will be tasked with supplementing the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy" in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for buyers, we have changed the appearance of our shelf rows of beauty products and the impression they have.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment along with a convenient location means that now we are a charming goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter Jones is full of fury, after Holly Willoubbi gives up 11 million pounds of deal.
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "became furious" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Viloubia has no time to devote to their home outfits and accessories brand "Truly".
The pair business was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning" 37-year-old programme manager used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Cholly Vilouby has left Dragon Den’s star Peter Jones in anger, because at the last moment he left the business of their profitable lifestyle brand — to focus on his new huge contracts with Mark & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information state that Jones was "filled with fury" when a TV golden girl, during a tight meeting in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, worth up to GBP 1.5 million, meant that she no longer had time to devote their home clothes and accessories to the Trily brand.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Guinnett Platorov and, according to the hint, it will double the richness of Viloubian, which is estimated to amount to 11 million pounds.
When Willowy (37) used Instagram to announce that he left "Truly", Jones took him away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information, "Truly was the most important of the Holly priorities.
This should have become her long-term future, which would have been devoted to the next decades.
Her decision to quit was surprised by all those involved not being prepared.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Mārlova there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the head of "This Morning", one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions of dollars to go, because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from cushions and candles to clothes and goods for the house, and their placing on the market will be even more delayed.
And that can mean a long end to friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoub, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Viloubia "Truly" together with Kep was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as president.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in the Boldvina TV producer company.
Viloubia must become an ambassador to the M&S brand, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones yesterday said, "We don't want to comment on his business!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism that would come from news companies about a comment that some might find 'the President inappropriate' and about his being so positive towards the leader of North Korea.
Why is the President giving up so much?
Trump said in his fined voice of "Know-Dicker."
"I didn't give up on anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again one time after Trump recognized their initial meeting in Singapore as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, one of the main North Korean diplomats, informed world leaders on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a US "response" to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues to be subject to sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Tramp was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of missile testing, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's just to give the President the impression, but instead of standing there 10 000 people trying to get into this closely populated area, we have 200 here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the people of Lombarda were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they said very clearly that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a certain problem," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" collects a group for driving to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pala in order to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given that earthquakes are taking place regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unfinished to the fury of nature.
Although shelter tsunamis have been established in Aceh (Aceh), these are rare along other shores.
It is likely that the death of humans was also influenced by the fact that Pala did not respond to the warning about the tsunami, even though the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital, which had anchored in Lombarda to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had made improving the destroyed infrastructure of Indonesia the centre of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr Joko's administration and is expected to be re-elected next year.
Moreover, Mr Joko has to deal with the long-standing problem of tension between the sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bears, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Starige with an ambitious rebalancing match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturidge saved Liverpool from loss to Chelsea's premiere at the 89-minute Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Starige received a game from Jerdan Shaqiri, who is about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea Gate when his team lost at 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the further gate of the room.
In this attempt, the ball was flying high across the board, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally flowed over the head of Kep Arrizabalag, the lens, and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get their position to be at the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," Starige explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kante) coming near, offended the ball, and without thinking much, I kicked."
The "Chelsea" was in the middle of the lead at 1:0, after 25 min by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues attacker played the ball back to Matheo Kovac, before turning around to the middle of the square and at the maximum speed to shoot on the side of the Liverpool.
Cowach quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the square.
Then he made a nice blow between the players, allowing Azard to enter the area.
Azards exceeded the speed of protection and finished the combination by blowing the left leg in the main room network, passing the Liverpool to Elison Becker.
Liverpool will fight with Napoli in the Champions League Group on Wednesday at 15.00 in Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will meet with videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832, and the National Disaster Agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after a 7.5-magnith earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) of high waves, the agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho informed the news conference.
The city of Pala, home to more than 380 000 people, was covered by ruined buildings.
Police suspects of arresting a woman 32 years old
The murder investigation was initiated this morning when a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44 - year - old wounded victim was found at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, and 32 - year - old man was suspected of murder.
The police have called for people in this area who have seen or heard something.
Brian O'Hagan, a detective inspector, said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was in Birkenhed on John's street and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something in the videos of their cars to contact us, as they may have important information for our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhed, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and, as reported by the police, they are involved in informing the closest relatives of the victim.
The taxi manager, who lives in Graysonmüsz, tried to return to his apartment, but the police replied that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours until they are allowed to return.
One could hear a police officer tell a man that the whole area was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the crime.
She continues to repeat: "It's so terrible!".
Two afternoons inside the cordon were two police vans, and another was placed right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment house.
Everyone with information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 by calling 247.
Kromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest "overwrite" scandal
Rejection would be ethically justified in view of the similar activities of the Taliban, which led to the destruction of so many monuments of English culture and religion by his fantastic Puritan followers.
However, the Crick's Society described the suggestion of Mr. Kromwell as "poority" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Kromwell's figure outside Westminster would also be the goal.
Kromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out a sanctification during the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed as a result of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s beautiful portrayal of Kromwell shows his view in the 19th century and is part of historiography as a person that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Many of the Cromwells - perhaps more than they were today at the end of the 19th century - considered themselves a parliamentary defender of external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
The historical discussion continues as to whether it really is a completely accurate representation of the subject.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Kromwell, as such, is a well-known personality that represents one of the parties to the breed at that time.
His achievements, being a protector of Lords, are worthy of praise and mention."
Pig-killed to death collapsed the farmer in China
According to information on the domestic media, the pig market in south-west China was attacked and killed by the farmer.
The man — only his name, Yuan — was found dead with broken arteries, all in one blood at the pighouse on the market in the Guizhou province of Lupanshui, reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
The pig is about to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in a pighouse in Xining in the province of Cynhai China.
He and his cousin were reported to have come on Wednesday from a nearby province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found a man dead and found that the backyard of pigs was open.
He said that there was a large male pig carrying blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy vegrel had broken the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and maimed," said the cousin – only his name was mentioned Wu, the article "Guiyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan entered the market at around 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or to his cousin.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the vepris were turned on to prevent their attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the site.
According to information, Juan family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such events are rare, other attacks by pigs are known in humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
10 years ago 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pig in Wales kept the farmers forced to the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After the farmers at Oregon in 2012 ate his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba explained that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "pistoll shot".
"They are just playful.
They like to get in, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Orkan Rose brings a large and strong case in the south-west of the United States
The Orcano Rose is projected to weaken as it moves across the coldest waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rose will bring flooding rains in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
Five o’clock in the afternoon (after the East of North America) the rosé winds reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the category 1 orcan and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the low-pressure pelvis, moving east towards the east coast of the United States, forms above the Pacific. On Monday it will begin to drive the mass of moisture from the tropical strip northward to the southwest of the United States with the force of tropical storm.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in the Monday part of Mexico.
The tropical humidity will then create a large area of heavy rains in the south-west over the next few days, interacting with the approaching low pressure plow.
1-4 inch (~2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
The moisture from the tropical strip will cause the rains, which will reach 2-3 inches (~5.1 to 7.6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 24 inches (~5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected in part south-west, especially in most Arizona.
There is a possibility of sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local fragrant winds and sand storms.
The low - pressure plow is nearing will bring local heavy rains on a part of the coast of Southern California.
Rains are possible, which together exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm) and can cause small mud flows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rain in the wet season.
Some dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday before the rain takes over a wider territory late on Monday and early Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the Four Section region (DR Colorado, DA Jūta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and last all Wednesday.
In October, there is scope for intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic is declining and the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in the town of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Dees Moines, Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
The next days will try to develop and expand long - term summer heat.
The beginning of October in most central and eastern United States is expected to be warm, reaching 80 degrees and above (Farenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in the city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees Fahrenheit) which would exceed an average of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
Our long-term climate projections show a high probability that in the first half of October the temperature in the eastern part of the United States will exceed the average.
More than 20 million people were listening to Britta Caven’s case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television channels were enthusiastically watched, as the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of having sexual harassment, claimed to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, the political undistributed, with the broadcasters interrupting the regular transmission to report on the latest turnaround on Friday: the agreement by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would investigate charges for a week.
Forda informed the Committee on Justice of the Senate that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno was wearing and trying to get his clothes off during the high school party.
Caveno was a dispassionate witness that he was absolutely convinced that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report, on Friday, all this was seen by 20,4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the interest of medium viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people looking at the offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of observers of the exclusion games or Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest audience, with an average of 5.69 million all day long hearings, informed Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million, informed Nielsen.
Interest remained high after hearing.
Fleuk was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican team had published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Kaveno, the senator was noticed by CNN and the CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by a call for indignation by protestors, tried to get the elevator to the hearing of the Committee on Justice.
Directed by CNN he stood for several minutes in the stabbed eyes, as barbed.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "you belong to power, while so many women are powerless."
Fleyk explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was told that he had something else to say at the hearing of the committee.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected on-line broadcasts several hours later, when the Committee on the Judiciary was about to vote in favour of the nomination of Kaveno for voting in the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate, which had been demanded by a minority of democrats, next week.
Fleuka was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend’s democrat, Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Koons and several other senators, Fleik made his decision.
The choice of Fleik was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes for the approval of Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Maya accused critics of political games in Bruxit
Prime Minister Terez Maye's interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, who criticise her plan to leave the European Union, accused people of "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa Maya arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, Maya's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexita's plan for the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Form Sims shooting: police arrested Ditheon Simpson, suspected of murder of a LSU player
The police have arrested the suspect of shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and arrested as an accused of second-degree murder, informed the Baton Rouge police station.
Officials released a video showing Sims’ clash with Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS subsidiary, WAFB, reports that the police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found the blood of Simpson on them.
After being interrogated, the police informed him that they had admitted to Wade's shooting.
According to a lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security.
On Friday, a team of court medical experts at the East Baton Rouge Parish Church gave a provisional conclusion that death was caused by a shot in the head that affected the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group on Search for Police Refugees in Louisiana, the State Police Criminalism Laboratory, the Police of the South University and the citizens of the territory for their assistance in investigating the results of the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Director of LSU Sports, thanked territorial lawmakers for their "deepness and work in the name of justice".
Sams was 20 years old.
6 feet (6 inches) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season in one game he scored on average 5.6 points and 2.6 falling bombs.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team is "spoiled" and "shocked" about the death of Wade.
"That's what a man's worried about always," said Wade.
The volcano is speculating ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Pokatepetla volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The centre observed multiple shakings and tremors.
The images on social networks showed that car windshields in Mexico City, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysics have noticed the activation of the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since the 7.1 magnified earthquake shocked the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catholic separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the conflict between the independent protesters and the public order police, and when thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on separation.
A group of disguised detachment supporters, who were held back by the public order police, left them with eggs and excavated powdery color, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally be tourist-filled.
Later that day, police were using stacks to prevent fighting.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters were involved in a confrontation with united protesters who said: "For a long time, Spain!"
The local newspapers reported that 14 people were given medical attention because of minor injuries they received during protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but praised by the Catholics, the idea of independence in the area taken over remains under great strain.
Voters have expressed their conviction about independence, although the voter's activity was low, and those who were against separation are, to a large extent, boycotters.
According to Catalonia's officials, almost 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at electoral stations throughout the region and there were brutal clashes.
The independence support groups had been on duty on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician who took part in the protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expects Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw the eyes of my parents fulfilled the tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although parties in favour of Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have fought to maintain progress this year, because several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and are waiting for justice for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed on the phone to support the protest police, said that the conflict had been provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalonia's leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody to the court since last year, announced that he would stand as a candidate for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Chanting in European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish Government has directed against us," he said.
London: Men arrested after a car crash in a building
Three men (aged 33, 34, and 39) were arrested after the car was hit several times against the building in London.
The incident took place in Balynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7.30 p.m. in the BST.
Detective inspector Bob Bleming informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Maybe it was shot at the car at the same time.
Coin blow allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first gates ensured the victory of Livingston
The supported Livingston stunned Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games, which took place in the role of manager of Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be crucial, because Gary Holt's team balanced the situation with Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won guests this season, and next Sunday they have to meet with the leader "Hearts", from which they lag behind eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers welcomed Vienna's Rapid on Thursday of the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series without loss in the Division to six games, and the main coach Holt has still not felt the taste of defeat since Kenny Miller replaced it last month.
Livingston does not use the opportunity to treat dull guests
The Holt team with its direct game, which made it difficult for Rangers in various ways, had to be in charge long before they got their names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt to the gate, then Alan Litgow's attempt, after slipping into his legs, to delay the Craig Halkett blow with his head across the gate line, was a failure.
Hosts have allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop guests in planned locations.
And that's how the decisive gates came.
Ranger allowed a free-browsing, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to provide an opportunity for Meng, who struck and got the gates from the middle of the zone.
During this stage "Rangers" managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved to be irresistible and the goal guard Liam Kelly was not particularly hindered by anyone.
This continued in the second half of the year, even though Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the work of Ranger Gatekeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov left the Livingston Gate in combination.
The Livingston area continued to show itself in centered bombs, but two calls for punishment — after the Halketa fought for the ball with the replacement Glenn Middleton and the hand play — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" Livingston performance — Analysis
Scotland's BBC Alasdair Lamont in the "Tony Maši" arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to outperform hope by improving performance.
Their style of play and personality have hardly changed since they returned to the highest helloon, but the Holt deserves great praise for the way he has united the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining a first class organizational protection, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Workall were always alert.
But the Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard’s authority, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into a part of the host square — and it is basically an invitation to wake up "Rangers in the middle of the table.
The Erdogan in Cologne is expected with shared feelings
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and blue skies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements about various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked, for reasons of security, a crowd of 25 000 people, not allowing them to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, a large part of whom were Kurds, also expressed their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to take him over.
The protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions created by a guest, some of whom consider the German Turkish to be a hero, while others despise others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place at the Bestwood Street intersection with Evelyn Street, on the road section with an intensive traffic in Deptford, in the south-east of the city at 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and medical help was given, but the man died instead of the event.
The clash took place several months after another bicycleist died on Chailders Street, about a mile from the Sunday clash.
The police service in the capital city stated that police were involved in identifying a man and informing his relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the site, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during troubleshooting
The Prison Administration reports that six inmates were injured in a poor male prison in a strict regime.
The troubles broke out in "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vorčesprestyra at approximately 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still on-going.
In order to prevent disorder involving eight prisoners who are encircled in one wing, the staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved
The employees at the site of the event were treated for mild facial injuries.
A representative of the prison service stated: "In order to resolve the incident in "HMP Long Lartin" prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance as a result of injuries.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and we clearly say that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a prison chief was reported to have been treated in the hospital following an inmate attack.
And last October, the workers responsible for the control of the mud were sent to prison to resolve the serious troubles in which the staff had been attacked by billiard bombs.
The Orcano, Rose Fenix, Las Vegas and Soltleixitija are threatened with sudden flooding (likely to benefit from the situation in the land affected)
Arizona is rarely affected by tropical depression, but that is likely to happen early in the beginning of the following week, when the Orcano Rosa will move with the remaining force across the desert southwest, risking a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in the south-eastern part of California and in the East of Yuta, including Fenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Soltleixitija.
Rosa is expected to move directly across the Fenixes on Tuesday, coming with the case late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service at Fenix on Twitter noted that since 1950, only "the ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 200 miles (320 km) radius from Fenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orcan 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2-4 inch (~5,08–10,2 cm) of rain, reaching even 6 inches (15,24 cm) in individual locations.
Other desert south-west areas, including the central part of the Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 inches (~2.54-5.08 cm), reaching 4 inches (~10.2 cm).
For those who are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding, Rose’s rain can become a blessing because the region has been struck by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is of very serious concern, some rainstorms may be beneficial because the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category reported by weather.com.
First of all, the Orkan Rose leads to the peninsula of Lower California in Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rose is still with the power of the Orcan on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm is faced with colder waters in the Pacific, and that is why it comes to rest.
Therefore, it is expected that anorcan with the power of a tropical storm will reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or morning.
In the case of the heavy gas part, Mexico can be strong, with a significant risk of flooding.
"The rain is expected to reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the south-west Sonora, the precipitation is likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported Weather.com.
Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the border of Arizona in the early morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and reach the southern Yuta in the late evening.
"The main threat to be expected from Rose or its residues is the very strong rainfall in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and the US deserted south-west," said the National Orcan Centre.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
attack on Midsommer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16 - year - old boy with wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 SCI.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
The police reported that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old adolescents, as well as a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the area of Redstock, Eivon and Somerset.
The police have called for reference to anyone who might have a cell phone material about what happened.
Tramp says that Kaveno has suffered from the evil and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump announced at the meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
The tramp stressed that Kaveno suffered from the "despiteness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his entire nomination process.
Caveno was a witness to Congress, where any accusation of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, both of whom were teenagers, was vigorously and emotionally denied.
Forda also testified to her charges in the course of the hearing.
On Saturday, the President announced that on that day "The people of America saw" Capene's "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history of service to the people," he announced to the supporters of the crowd in Western Virginia.
President Kaveno's nomination was mentioned around him, talking about the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I wasn't a candidate, but actually I was a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps argued that the Democrats had taken on the mission of 'protest and resist'.
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno will take place not later than Friday, the CNN informed the senior assistant of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away, when gigantic waves hit the shores after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Pala, where up to six feet (18 feet) high waves hit the shore of a chair, washing many in death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami broke out after a 7.5 beam earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency, informed Jakarta.
"Cunami did not arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it ran everything on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that tsunamis had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before going against the coast.
"Many people climbed trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Photos taken on flight by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water - surrounded mosque.
Afterflushing coastal cities continued to shake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application in the BPPT Communication stressed that the energy released by the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb cast down at Hirosim during World War 2.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have strengthened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and informed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and destructions could be larger along a coastline of 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communication "was completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala," said Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," the Red Cross announced in the communication, adding that the affected regions are visited by their staff and volunteers.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not informing that the Tsunami had found Pala, although the officials claimed that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
The video on social networks shows that a man on the top floor desperately calls people on the street at the bottom of a tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore by washing the buildings and machines.
The news agency Reuters was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunamis led to a serious loss of power, which cut off communication in Pala, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The officials stated that the army had begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but those who were evacuated still need food and other first - need items.
The airport is only open to assistance measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Dooseba said that the World Vision employees who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala and who are now living in a tarpaulin's backyard in the office yard went by the way to the scenes of the damage.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were destroyed," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when the relief teams were determined to organise disaster relief, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian laws and regulations, the financing, resources and personnel of the overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the territory of the damage is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government declares, 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been established."
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become wonders making life lighter during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the gulf.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who was printed under the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national paragliders, had prepared two of the unprecedented paragliders for Asian games that took place this month in Indonesia.
Other of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I'm being taught the emotional burden."
Mr Gendon recalled that after the paragliders spread news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent whatsApp reports to the Pall participants who participated in the beach festival for hours.
However, his reports produced only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thimbles stolen 26,750 dollars during the ATM filling in the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a Newport Police Department statement, the thieves stole 26 750 dollars for Brink's officer, who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Levee package, Friday morning.
"The car manager emptyed the entertainment complex ATM and was ready to fill it with more money," Denis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "flagged Brink's from the back to the employee" and stole the bag with the ATM money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses observed a number of suspicious persons who left the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: rapper changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje Wests changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced the replacement on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "A being previously known as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West has been known for some time as Je, and used its name as the name of its eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before he appeared at the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell us that he replaced the singer Ariana Grande who stopped his work "emotional cause".
The West has said that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also plays a religious role.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "Tu"," Vest explained earlier this year by discussing the title of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first was Kanje, which means "only one, it followed "Ye", which has a reflection on the good and the bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
Album is more a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Simon Combs, known until now as both Puff Daddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love Brother).
Jay-Z, who had previously cooperated with Vesta, also has and has not used the word sign and the capital letters.
The President-elect of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico, Andre Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody refund for students is coming.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday "Tlatellolco Plaza" never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Army units shot the peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by issuing subsidies to students every month and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities bring young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explained by the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various US government bodies made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks a strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become a key country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A twofold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and the next cardinal turning point in artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
During the interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding could double the chance that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the USA.
Lie, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt" is the Executive Director of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China "Face++".
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University (Karnegi-Melona) to create an artificial intelligence system that would exaggerate America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was the leading officer of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the technology competition organised by the previous US government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when he would be prepared for next year to identify people with ideas for the future.
"The scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," said Lee.
"Not China is attracting leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve their performance in the area of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be given automatically to people with a doctoral degree in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding for people from academic institutions, similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department established a joint artificial intelligence centre, which is intended to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence of the United States) announced a 2 billion-dollar investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
In turn, the National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation, the task of which was to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, taking a step that will prevent the dispute with Greece that has lasted decades and has blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a Macedonian province, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia for NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new title, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the changes would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian sluiceful majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that I will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign to boycott has raised concerns as to whether the voter's activity will reach at least 50% of what is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum newsletter asks the question: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that is worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as the EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the cover of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgijevsk, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the title, a 2/3 majority will be needed in the parliament.
The National Electoral Commission informed that violations had not been reported by 1 afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, the voter in Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko, gave their voices in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old of Skopje, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs for tents set by those who put a referendum in boycotts.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with a raised head, not through the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs claims that NATO membership will launch the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that most of us will cast a vote in favour, the more than 80" percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the transfer of the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, less than the required activity.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telema TV revealed that 57 percent of the voters were going to take part in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for a referendum to be successful, the voter's activity must be 50 per cent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power last May.
Look at: The City of Manchester Serhio Aguero is encircling through the entire Brighton protection to get the gate
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton by allowing the City of Manchester on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero gave the impression that his gate gain in 65 minutes was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian attacker received a game in the middle of the area at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and went into the free court.
Then Agvero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He put the ball on one guard, and then he beat several more Brighton squares.
Then he made the game left, reaching Sterling.
The English center attacker used his first touch to play back in Agvero, who applied the right football boot to beat up the "Brigton" goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, striking the ball on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardian) manager of "City" told reporters.
"We discussed with him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at that time.
However, it was Sterling, which provided Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Prime Minister's wrestling.
The gates were made in 29 minutes.
Agvero got the ball in the game deep within Brighton.
He sent the ball with a nice blow along the Leroy Sane's left leg eggs.
A number of hits were carried out in Sanae until Sterling entrusted the ball to the farthest doorpost.
The Sky Blues Center attacker easily reinstated the bomb in the network just before crossing the border.
City in the "Hoffenheim" Championships in the League Group at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zin Shaima, Germany.
Shercer wants to have a problem with Rockies
Since "Nationals" does not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason for yet to resume.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies will have topical exclusion games. And Rockies in the West Group of the National League is led by one game against the Dodgers in Los Angeles.
Rockies has squeezed at least a white card by Friday evening with 5:2 winning the "Nationals", but still has not won its first title on the Division.
"Even though we play the same thing, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be the most vulnerable one I will face this year.
And why would I not want to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as it is said, is ready to let Shercer make a shot.
Shercer, to whom it will be the beginning of 34, made a seduction session outside the "bullpen" part on Thursday and will throw a ball on Sunday during the normal rest.
The "Washington" lab is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Tramps Organize Myths in Western Virginia
The President referred to the situation in which the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno, who was chosen by him, spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"In November, everything that we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
It's really very, very serious: I didn't stand as a candidate, but actually I am a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
The tramp went on: "You see this terrible, terrible group of democrat radicals who are acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all possible means to achieve the goal.
They don't care what they're hurting, who has to break over them to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of 'prospect and resist'.
"And you have seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the democrats 'the furious, the evil, the rude and the false'.
He named him Dianne Feinstein, an senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate's Committee on Justice, to whom the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what is it?
No, hmm, wait, it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant to the public
It was not surprising that "Momentum" activists in my local party wanted to censor me.
After all, I am so far in the last line of Members of the Labour Party Parliament, who was informed that he is not desirable, all because we do not hide our opinion.
With my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan turned around in the same way, because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, of national security, of Europe – ironically, but these were issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Communication on the Labour Summit in the East of Nottingham on Friday states that 'we want to have inclusive and productive meetings'.
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of eight members of my local Labour Parliament were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different, and promises of a 'happier, more self-governing' policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any views are judged depending on whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues, who think our political views were similar, began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have accepted in other cases, whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak to the public - and it is not important in essence what I say - is followed by a tirade on social networking, calling for a ban on candidates for next elections, deposing that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have more success than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are confronted with sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to avoid obeying.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of opinion and with every distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowed.
Over the last two years, I have often been advised not to go on foot, think what I'm talking about, and then I'll be "all right".
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the negligence of the Téchere government, which literally led my class of integrated school to collapse, I had the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I been in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I did not agree with the current government.
I can only say to those on Friday that, at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Bruxita, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to Labour Party leaders.
But basically the only thing I want to announce is not the Momentum of Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour members: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of denying a candidate or reminding you that no one is indispensable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unspeaked "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts may have to some extent shrunk the final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazing match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unspeaked team from ten.
After all, it was their great protection, as well as much better use of the opportunities that led the hosts, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we're still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All dignity "Ayr", they used their opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute by Frazzier Climo was raised by Ayr, but his yellow card to the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors had given the game, changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot caught an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased the management of "Ayr" with a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized the solo attempt, and therefore "Ayr" interrupted on the went 17-5.
But Melrose started halfway through a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Begots, reduced the gap to 5 points.
Then there was a long break, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was taken away from the field on the ramps, but when the game resumed, Ayr quickly moved forward, when Staffford McDowell made an attempt that Klimo realized.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received the yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player — an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not implemented.
However, the hosts were caught up, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card that caught Klimo without a bomb, from the penalty corridor, McFerson carried the same daun at the back of the "Ayr" moola.
Klimo realised the ball, as before, almost from the start of his own rerun after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick in the field and sent the flang players Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt.
“Still Game” star seems to plan a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kierran, the star of the comeds series "Still Game", seems to be planning to engage in hospitality business, because it turned out that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays at the popular BBC show, Jack Jarvis, which he creates and shares with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Cyrus apparently plans his life after Craiglang (Craiglang).
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of "Scottish Sun" pointed out that Kärnan planned to participate in Glasgow's "residence business".
"The sea belongs to us!": land trapped Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling around the moored Flote headquarters in Lapasa.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based vessels from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have been decorated with a motto: "We have the right to sea.
Its recovery is our duty."
In Bolivia trapped on land, the memory of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century about the lost coastline is still alive, as is the longing to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations have probably been the highest since decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and calm in its spirit and, of course, looks forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will be watching the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's request that, after several decades of negotiations, it is Chile's duty to discuss the granting of sovereign exits to Bolivia after a break.
Evo Morales, the President of Bolivia's area of origin, who is waiting for a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in the decision of Monday.
"We're close to recovering the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider that a court ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if so, no major change is expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to confer the territory of Chile and its representatives have said that they will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is handed down by anyone six months after the final examination shows that the case "was not complex" was explained by the international regulatory expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years of Bolivian affairs have not moved forward, but, on the contrary, delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' rooky rhetoric is in the Chilean has stunned the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their negotiations once, but after this it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
A representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Edwardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court ruled unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts that will benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used marine problems as political cruises.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity for cutting-off what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, said that his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during the two leaders' meetings in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when it seemed that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was ready to resume the deadly diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Chen.
Ri claims that these are "fantasias" to hope that the US still remains unpunished sanctions and the unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war will ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the armament, which state probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan in the following month to prepare the next Kim's meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive line of headgear on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the viewers with a series of absurd, huge items on their head in the 2019 spring/summer collection, which drew light on the style of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, very unpractical hats have flooded Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to show fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beautiful beige hat decorated with feathers-like wide edges that devoured the head.
Among the massive accessories were watermelons, magic hats, and even pineapples — but not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips, and they were served by Hannibal Lekter rather than by high fashion.
One formation reminded the breathing mind of diving, tube, and glasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice - cream cone.
And if you want to continue with a massive fashion, it's the right time.
Styla’s observers believe that the huge aubs may be on the way to your nearest High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very unpractical hats as a cult object on all social networks led to another big piece of tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as large as the bathing suit model that carried it.
Reddish yellow raffia bag, decorated with raffia blouse and equipped with a white leather handle took a special place in the spring/summer collection of the 2019 spring/summer fashion week.
Luce Armitage explained: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in central shop shops next summer, because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge size accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has preserved it in 2018, when the outstanding exam results were once again obtained, which are reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other social events.
This school, with a total of 30 000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to ensure the best level of performance for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their lives as world citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relations and gain the trust of people from other countries.
In the light of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of league tables with the largest number of exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages reached the highest grade of A.
Data from the Scottish Council of Independent Schools on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest A mark in Chinese, and 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an option, are valued as high in independent school programs as in science-technology-engineering science and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey of the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers mentioned language skills as reasons for inability to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world by increasing job opportunities, which will require language skills.
Regardless of their chosen career, they will gain the real advantage of such long-term skills in the future by learning a foreign language.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multilingual interrogator.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not know a foreign language enough to maintain a conversation, while the French was the only one in which a two-digit number of people spoke, 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to language teaching is important for today's children.
Several languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of their languages.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of Britain, according to plans until 2020.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scotland’s young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (This is what you have to do).
John Edwards, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron in the debut "Lakers" composition Sunday in Sandjego
Fans have finally met the moment Lebron's first game in Los Angeles' "Lackers" will take place.
Lake Walton, a Luke Walton coach, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the pre-Seson opening game against the Denver Nuggets in Sandwich.
But we still have to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed "Lakers" on the official website.
Lake Trudell, a reporter, wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
Continuing this week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the "Lacker" series of six pre-Seson games.
"In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season games to prepare for," he said.
Time of Trampa settlement in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts today in Weeling, Western Virginia, with a series of settlements.
This is the first of the five tramples planned next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of Trump is to obtain support in the upcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control in Congress after the transfer of votes in November.
How many tramp houses in Western Virginia are going to take place today, and how can you watch it online?
The trampo settlement in Vīlinga, Western Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the trampoline in Western Virginia online on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will talk about listening to this week in the case of the candidate of the Supreme Court Britta Kaveno, which has been accused of sex crimes, and a vote of the Senate is expected to be postponed for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main aim of this meeting is to help improve the situation of the Republican people who are expected to be elected in November.
Consequently, President Trump's campaign shows that this next week's five headquarters are supposed to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives" according to the Reuters.
"The control of the Congress on his agenda is so important that the President will visit the State as much as possible, because we are launching an active campaign season," said a representative of the Trampa campaign, who did not want to reveal his name, "Reuters".
This evening's meeting, which is planned for Wesbanco Arena in Vīling, is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit Western Virginia, the state in which he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent.
The tramp is trying to help the candidate for the West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in accordance with the surveys.
"It is not a good sign to Morisei that the president has to come to help improve his results in polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Raidera Cup 2018: USA has demonstrated determination to fight to maintain high expectations for Sunday singles
After three sessions in "single words" on Wednesday afternoon in the format of the "toursome" game, it was possible exactly what was needed for this Raidera cup.
The athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, on which side do they think there's luck now?
"They were leading with six points, but now with four points, so I think that means in a way that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth when he went on his way.
Europe is, of course, a priority, because it is at the forefront of 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
She explains that the Americans believe that the wind blows their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course also in the person of Spitis and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points out of four.
The spawn has been destructive from the first blow point to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those gutular victories became louder when his round continued, a decisive blow on the fall was made to reach four times the same number of hits when he and Thomas were left behind for two strokes after two.
His blow in the dead, which reached their victory 15 , was perceived with a similar cry, from them, of his conviction that the American team has not yet been excluded.
"It is really necessary to arm deeply, and worry about your match," Spit said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 pits to succeed.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spitis and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter this Raidera Cup in history.
Europe's strange but attractive couple lags behind four points and will not be able to harm them.
Molywood was the only couple who lived without bogy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine last pits on Friday morning.
This process and the way in which their energy flows to this frantic crowd and back convinces them to be players to win on Sunday, and Flywood with Molinari will be the most popular players that can provide a potential European victory when the sun is going over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, the discussion of the European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to deal with this morning's hero in the "fourbans" format of Serhio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogies and the two doubles led the Spanish and Swedish stools into the front nines, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you cope.
The games "flourban" and "toursome" are so exciting to watch close-to-neighbours due to interactions, to see what advice they give and not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played a better role as a team, and before the last day it is far led, but this race in the form of a "toursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight for which many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
The European team on the last day of the Raidera Cup is in charge 10-6
The European team at the Raidera Cup will start the last day under pleasant leadership after the Saturday "flourban" and "toursome" competitions ended with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were led by two victories over the hardworking Taiger Woods, which increased the number of 'Le Golf National' points to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in order to preserve the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate American teams in the morning competitions in the "flourbans" format, and the result of the series became 3-1.
In the United States, "toursomes" were more vigorously opposed, winning two match, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points in Sunday 12 single-games to save the trophy.
Flywood is the first European first-year-old to win four points in a row with Molinary, called Molliwood (Mollywood) after a sensational weekend is only the second couple in the history of the Raidera Cup, which scored four points in the first four matches.
In the "fourbans" format of the defeated Woods and Patrick Reed, they then effortlessly defeated the tired Wood and American newcomers, Bryson Dechambeau, with an even more empathy score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed at times a great game, but he has lost 19 of the 29 match "flourbans" and "toursomes" formats, in addition seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "flourbans" and returned to partner Henry Stanson's "toursomes" to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and second in the world ranking.
Europe did not succeed in achieving its full potential, even though the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and blowing light wind.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf race, Jordan Spicy and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They extorted 2&1 against the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the "flourban" format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "toursomes" after the first two pits had lost.
Only twice in the history of the Raidera Cup has the team played a 4 point in the deficit alone, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) is enough for the team to have a single result to keep a trophy.
After the second place in two days, it looks like the Sunday attack will be problematic.
North Korea declared that in the case of "no" it would not be destroyed unilaterally, without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust for the United States, and North Korea will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "significant steps of good will" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile trials, the dismantling of nuclear bombs and the promise never to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korea's accusations about Washington's resistance to a 'phasing-by' approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be compensated for its gradual steps, his statement left the impression, because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Chennon and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the President of the United States and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Phenjana must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not stood by the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that 'denuclearisation must be first' and increases the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even by opposing the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could force us on our knees is the empty fantasy that is cherished by people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri was not talking about the intentions of Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned when speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister highlighted three meetings of Kim with South Korea's leader Mun Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the other half of this denuclearisation issue were South Korea rather than the US, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such an impasse."
However, the Tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from what he said last year in the UN General Assembly, when he stated that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the continental part of the US was inevitable after the 'Dad President's Tramps called Kim a 'missile' on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearised.
Wednesday Trump announced that he had not planned a certain time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for the progress made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions needs to be vigorously continued without errors until a definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring about the destruction of funding for the Phenjan nuclear- and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside of UN General Assembly meetings and then informed that he would again visit Phenjan the following month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He went away from Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but just after a few hours North Korea accused him of “gangstering demands”.
North Korea's meeting with Mun this month committed to dismantling a landfill of weapons and also a nuclear complex if the US took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a subject on how to have enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year has managed to make students sleep more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular brutalist culture, which involves a caffeine-filled study throughout the night.
One teacher found that the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist developed a subject that he believes is the first such subject in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject came from speaking about the impact of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, "Why should I just tell it when I'm in the last course?"
She found that no one ever explained to her the importance of sleep — which surprised me — he said "Telegraph".
This year's first launch of the subject of study, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sports achievements, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the Executive Director of the University Health Services informed that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students are suffering from serious sleep problems during the week.
The hour long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part is a picture of the doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sport is affected by sleep shortage and the importance of sleeping routines.
In the other part, students are informed about how prolonged sleeplessness may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the student town with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behaviour at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how cigarette smoking will affect your health," said Professor Chaisler.
He said that the culture, proud of the ability to learn all night long, and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that ensuring enough quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, overload and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep turns the brain into a fasting regime, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop his subject after having participated in one of the professor’s lectures in the first course of Harvard last year.
He said that the subject of the study had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive postgraduate education to learn a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Chaisler recommends students to install an alarm not only for the time when they get up, but also when they go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how people are harming the "blue lights" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps, because they can break down the rhythms of the day, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengo gates overturn Gerard's men
Rangers found another sad game for guests when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard's confused team decided to lose 1 - 0 against Livingston.
The "Ibrox" team hoped to win the first victory since February 4:1 in the triumph "St Johnstone", but the Gary Holt team provided Gerard with his second loss in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the leader of the Scottish Championship "Hearts".
Menga hit the ball in the gate seven minutes before half an hour, and the lack of inspiration for the Rangers did not look like anything after an attempt to level the result.
"Rangers" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" rises to the third, and only "Hibernian" exceeds it in terms of the difference between the gates.
And Rangers may have another problem, because the assistant of the judge Kalum Spence needed medical help because of a head injury, which was apparently caused by an object that was thrown away from the end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind "Ayr" to reach the "Betfred" Cup semi-finals.
While Holts used the same "Livingston" 11 players who in the previous week took away "Hearts" one point, and he would be happy to see how his well trained team pressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the ball more often, but Livingston made better use of what was their actions.
They had to get the gate two minutes after the first Menga game sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then a long time ago, King Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in his protection, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball far past the rear stable.
Rangers took control, but the impression was that the last third of the game is expected, not believed, that it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly believed that he should have been fined at 15 minutes after facing Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the College's call.
Rangers performed only two hits in the first half of the year; however, the former Ibrox goal guards Liam Kelly were particularly undisturbed by neither Lassana Coulbaly’s head nor the modest end of the attack by Ovie Ejaria.
Although "Livingston" could have changed the course of the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their efforts.
Rangers didn't deal again with Jacobs' planned long combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Mengo for a simple end.
Gerard replaced Kulibali during his break with Ryan Kent, and it almost immediately influenced the game, because he sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly tried to block him from his line immediately.
But Livingston continued to tell the guests to play the way they like, doing one long blow after the other to Litgov and Halket.
The Holt team could have continued to lead the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov hit his head from the corner.
Ranger's alternate, Glenn Middleton, requested another penalty in the late game after facing Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanaha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... one day Johannes Wilhelm Hans Gaiger, who grew up as a physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, the result of which was a device known as the Geiger counter.
In science, the remaining Geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, such as Bells of Coronado (Koronado) in 1950, where externally unconvincing cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played their main roles:
The man, "Who the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you will be able to hear how the atoms that are released by the radioactivity generated by these minerals work."
Evans: "Truly, that really is what you're saying!"
"Hans" Gaiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named after him continues to exist.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
In the course of vaccine treatment, it teaches the immune system to recognise the bad cells
Using this method, the patient obtains immune cells that convert into a laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise bad cells experienced the loss of her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is intended to extract the cells of the patient’s immune system, transform them into a laboratory so that they can “see” several tumor-specific proteins HER2, and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky informed: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoting the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach, when receiving immune cells from the patient, in which they "mocked" how to attack cancer cells, has been shown to work in one type of leukaemia.
Kane West, after visiting the SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump critics.
It didn't end well
Kanje West was wasted on a studio "Saturday Night Live" show after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand as a candidate for the 2020 presidential elections.
He finished that night with the third song, called "Ghost Town", during which he worn the hat of "Make America Great", he began to wear loud phrases about democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"So many times when I speak to the white people, they demand: "How can you like Trumps? He's a racist!"
Well, if I worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with an exhibition with Matt Damon in his main role, where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice on the charge of Christine Blasey Ford in a sexual attack.
Although not broadcasted, the material was loaded by Chris Rock on Vest’s pity social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West this way.
And the West was sorry to the audience that he had been mistreated by the backstages because of his headset.
"They laughed at me backstage!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head!"
They laughed at me!
And they said that I had lost my connection with reality," said the West, according to the "Washington Examiner".
The West went on to say, "You can see what happens when you lose contact with reality?" and promised to put on "your Superman settlement", because it means you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Varety" reported that his comments caused the audience's whistles at least twice, but the team members of the show looked confused, and at least one person told the press: "In the study there was a total silence."
Ariana Grande, who had died a friend of rapper Max Miller, a few days ago, was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande.
The West confused many with the song (I Love it) that he performed in the champagne bottle costume.
The Vest was supported by a conservative group TPUSA leader, Canada Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the longest people: PATEICOS, WHY NOT BEING BETTER!"
But the conversation show leader, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was what he was, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (buy his music or clothes or support his "art") who, I believe, supports and smells with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he has now become "a presence previously known as Kanji Vesta".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dog, was in the past Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name by a symbol, but then to "the art of the repository, which was previously known as Prince".
Indicted murder attempt at a collision in Belfast’s restaurant
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of murder after a man was hit in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Belfast Master's Court on Monday.
Appeals will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Trone Games" Star Kitt Herrington targets toxic masculinity
Another Herrington is known as the sword-winding John Snow HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Trone Games".
However, the 31 - year - old actor has turned to the brutal character stereotype by saying that such characters often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kitt explained that in his opinion there was a "problem", and asked how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married her "Rone Games" partner, Rose Leslie, 31 years old, admitted that this problem was important to him.
"I can't think about what mistakes we made with manhood right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem when they grow in the light of the existing problem?"
Another believes that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for increasing toxic malehood.
He said, "What is innate, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel they need to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because young men have clearly had problems."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any continuation of the "Trones Game" or in the throat, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are exhausted".
From November Kit will play a key role in the restored Sam Shepard "True West", which is a story about the film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife, Rose, as the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Trones Games".
"I met my wife in this show, because in a way it provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Another character, John Snov’s favorite Igrith, played at the fantasy series that won the Rose Emmy Prize.
In June 2018, a couple of the islanders owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Aid: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China stated that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual relations, suggesting changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, and Chinese health officials were informed at a conference in the province of Junnan.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 a year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of under-protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicines as part of the response to the problem.
Maksina Waters denies that the employee flooded the data of Republican senators, is very much against "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, the US Chamber of Representatives, denied the claims that her staff had published personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the statements are distributed by the "ultra right" wing allies and Internet sites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters made it on Twitter.
It is reported that flooded information includes residential addresses and telephone numbers owned by the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Jūta.
Information appeared online on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time when the Senate Group heard about the accusations of Bret Kaveno nominated for the Supreme Court in sexually improper conduct.
Some time after the three senators questioned Kaveno, the source of the leak.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is linked to Waters' office and disclosed information about Waters' personnel, informed Hills.
"This unfounded statement is absolutely false and complete lies!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security is compromised because of this fraudulent and false statement, is in no way responsible for the release of information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely false and absolutely false!"
The Waters Statement soon led to criticism online, including the criticism of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," said Fleisher.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a Congress member.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he should not be angry.
He can't be a soldier.
He may not speak about the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
The task of Fleicher was to compare Waters' reaction with the fall of the democrat for Kaveno, who was accused of being too angry to hear on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the loss of Waters’ chair in the interim elections, also expressed its views on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed her that her office had warned officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognised as legally responsible for all their works, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my personnel."
Jonie Coal 3 — Rovan Atkinson's exhibition on spy films left in his half wheel
It has become customary to look for an association with Bruxita in every new film with British taste, and this seems also to refer to this one, which has revived, the fantasy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny Angli and reborn in 2011 with Johnny Angli returns.
Is the teeth cleaned for themselves, for how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny England, with its immersed eyes and an unusually moving face, has the right to make a leap after the second resuscitation — more than anything else — signals that he is a wide range of comic characters developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims for a charming beauty, is a little Cluzo, a little Mr. Bin, and a little salt of the guy who plays one note in the Chariots of Fire theme music at the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
There's at least one or two nice moments in Johnny Angly's latest adventure.
I liked a place where Johnny Coal went to the helicopter's outfit in medieval armor, and the propeller's blades are glowing against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is very visible, but humor is quite weak and strange superficial, especially because "serious" cinema brands, like "007" and "Unlikely Mission", use comedy with confidence as one of their components.
Humor gives the impression that it is devoted to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny Angly's absurd distress is not as creative and purposeful as the tricks of Atkinson's memorial films in the skin of Bain.
As usual, everything is based on Britain getting into a serious casket.
Cyberhaker has broken the British super-secret spy Internet network, revealing the identities of all the British agents in this field, and a disliked active agent — a deplorable little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pumping man and the person who has been in conflict, who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing something that he can with Teresa Maya, but there is not much in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform us that, since all active spies have been made public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the intrusive Johnny Coal, who now works as a teacher at a fine educational institution, and teaches obediently how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because England offers to learn a spy's profession from the very foundations.
Coal is delivered back to the extraordinary meeting of Vaithol and is combined with its former many victim assistants Bo, which is also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun personality that only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Highness and met Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fateful woman Ofelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, Prime Ministers have dangerously overshadowed the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Walt, who is pictured by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve a British computer caste.
Coal and Bo are starting their savage fun odyssey: masking about the officeists, they set fire to the fine French restaurant; they create confusion by hiding in the Volt luxury yacht; and coal causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of Volt’s building.
Everything is done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains many elements of children’s television.
A lot of moderate elements.
Like in other Johnny Angly films, can I wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn is going to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work for four days a week and receive a salary for five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to make savings by means of the artificial intelligence revolution for workers by giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy the three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the agenda of the party in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One of the highest representatives of the Labour Party informed "The Sunday Times": "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen on one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce the four-day week of the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party, as such, does not support this hunger at the moment.
The Labour Party representative said: "The working week of four days is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The shadow minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to give his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonell explained that he was determined to take power away from the mass of directors and the speculators of public service companies.
The shadow ministers also plan to mean that the existing medium-sized shareholders in the water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour Government could implement the "deductibility" due to the injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and to set up exclusive Ownership Funds in order to allocate 10% of private sector companies' capital to employees who would receive dividends up to 500 pounds each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes," or an FBI investigation in the Caveno case could change their opinion
The investigation of the FBI’s accusation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the Bureau could lead any Republican senator to withdraw its support.
During the interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent of 60 Minutes, interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their thoughts.
Kennedy left a more open impression than his fellow in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, addressing the listening procedure, I said that I had spoken to judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, Grem’s vote is obviously stoned.
"I made a decision about Brett Kaveno, and there will be a bad charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know that's what: Brett firmly denied it," added Grem, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Grand Maure of the Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jacksone, Repere Cardi B and Shann Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Cizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international defence group Global Poor Project, which hopes to put an end to poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless they wanted to pay for VIP ticket), the concert visitors needed to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of the ending of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Cizen movement been, which leaves 12 more years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert award a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "clidity" when people think they can really influence something by signing an online petition or by sending a Twitter message?
The movement Global Citizens says that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than USD 37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and statements arising from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the allocated funds so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and implementers established in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow up fully" by promising Rwanda with USD 35 million to help end their malnutrition after more than 4700 Twitter messages from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice of malnutrition in the history," said Tracey Ullman, representative of “The Power of Nutrition” in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that, following the launch of more than 5000 measures, the government announced the allocation of funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children, calling on the UK Government to provide better nutrition to mothers and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Cizen commented: "It will be a long and long road in which we will get up and suffer failures.
However, as has been done by the great civil rights and anti-apartid movements before us, we will also succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, led by Deborr-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use a war fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports – claims the Minister of the Interior
"In case of need," Washington can use its navy to prevent Russia from entering the market for energy, including in the Middle East, as stated by Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister of the Interior, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s activity in Syria, especially in areas where it operates as part of a legitimate government invitation, was an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can, through its navy, make sure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed a public who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation known as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trampa administration is contributing to exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump Administration Officer and also U.S. President Donald Tramps are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Tramp, would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth USD 11 billion, which would double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fervent resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier," said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after the September meeting with US Minister of Energy Ricke Perija.
The US has expressed its negative position against Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Putin.
Elizabetes Warena, Senator of Massachusetts, will consider his candidacy for the 2020 presidential elections seriously
On Saturday, the Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that he was serious about to stand as President after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting of the Council in Holok, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that he was considering candidates for Presidential elections.
"It is high time that there are women in Washington who will "reconstruct" the imperfect government, which also means a woman president," she says in The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the US presidential elections."
During the meeting of the Council, Warren referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he "leads this country in the wrong direction".
"I am worried at the depths of what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticised Trump and his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno.
Friday's Twitter report Vorena said: "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's supporters do not believe that they should stand as candidates in the 2020 elections.
According to the survey of the Political Research Centre/the Boston Globe newspaper of the University of Sufolk, fifty-eight percent of "potential" massachusetts voters claimed that the senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The survey showed that former governor, Deval Patrick, received more support, receiving 38 percent of election candidates and 48 percent against.
Another possible candidate for election in the elections in 2020 is the names of high-profile Democratic Party workers, such as former Vice-President Joe Baden and Senator of Vermont, Child Sanders.
News agency "Associated Press" informed that Baden was determined to give a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peilin quotes Treka Peilin PTSS at Donald Trampas
Trak Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called at the military service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, whom he goes through after return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of the PTSS and some dose of vulnerability that our soldiers return to," she said to the public at Donald Trump's home in Toul, Oklahoma.
Peline called his arrest a "obvious problem that everyone pretends to see" and said about her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, they return fortification, they come back thinking about whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to this country, as well as all the other members of the military."
According to a representative of Vasilla Police Department, Den Benet, he was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against women and of holding a weapon under pressure.
18 States, Colombia Region challenges a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and Colombia are in favour of a legal challenge for a new US policy that prevents the victims of asylum who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, D.C., representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian region submitted a brief statement to the judge in support of the asylum seeker facing the obstacles created by this policy, reports NBC News.
The applicant's full name, Grace v. Sessions, which was launched by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of US asylum seekers come, as countries with a common problem are gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the decision of the Board of Appeal of Immigrants in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, General Prosecutor of Colombia Karls Racins announced that the new policy "is ignoring the laws of state, federal and international law introduced to the Decades".
"The Federal law provides that all requests for asylum shall be dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim concerned, and such obstacle violates this principle," said the court's advisor in brief.
In addition, the lawyer said in his presentation that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants would most likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions asked the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Shelter is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sixtons said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palau, with the number of deaths doubling in the search for survivors
The situation became more and more difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, comforting his fever-flying baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed Palu city.
"Each minute, the emergency services bring new victims.
Clean water is a shortage."
The people were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and were able to make a great deal of waterfalls, trying to save everything they could.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnified earthquakes were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had broken the spine and shoulder, lay outside of the Palais Army Hospital, where patients were cared for outside because of the persistent, heavy after-crusts.
His eyes had tears, remembering how the violent earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was printed in wall ruins," said Harris to the news agency "Associated Press", adding that his family had arrived in the city for wedding purposes.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of intimidating attempts through propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper launched four-page ads, emphasising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trumps last Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the most sold newspaper of the state of Iowa, Des Moines Register, accused China of trying to intervene in the 6 November US Congress elections, but China denies it.
The accusation made by Trump that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what US officials said to the Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new stage in the increasing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is quite normal that foreign governments place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, with the result that they apply a series of tariffs to imports from one another.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, claiming that China "is now doubling this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses the tradition of freedom of speech and free press in its good for America by inserting paid advertising "Des Moines Register," said Brannastad.
"However, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited amount of different opinions and you will not see such a true reflection of different opinions, which the Chinese people may have in relation to the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from the mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will be subjected to a negative reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially on the part of women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give their voice.
Such cases cannot be revoked, "It was announced to the article "The Hill" by Grant Reeher, professor of policy at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School of Science.
Rüher doubts that the last minute encouragement of the senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation will be a big reason to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and representative of the progressive MoveOn movement on Friday, according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C."
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate's ancestors sang "Novembris come!" when Republicans under the authority of the Judicial Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," the independent political analyst Stu Rotheenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already on a high level, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among volatile voters living in the suburbs and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often do not go to the elections even if the president does not like it."
Even before the public testimony of Forda, in which she made statements about sexual violence from the candidate of the position of the Supreme Court, analysts mention a possible failure if Republicans continued to apply for this candidacy.
"The Republican Party has become a messy chaos," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
'This is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be sentenced, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have treated it,' said Guy Cecil - Director of Priority USA, who heads this group, which helps to elect democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans are somewhat divided about who believes in Forda and Caveno, with a tendency to believe the last one a little more.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 percent say they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno might or must have lied about his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Forda and at least another accused person, Deborah Ramirez, following the move from Fleika.
Last week, Forda showed in the Senate's Committee on Justice that Kaveno, at the age of 17, had committed a sexual assault against him.
Ramirez claims that during the studies in Yala, the candidate for the position of a judge of the Supreme Court has shown her his genius at a party in the 1980s.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the "Solid" platform opened by Berners-Lie.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lie laughed that the hidden intention of Inrupt is to "demont over the world".
"We should do it now," he said for the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses "Solid" technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
The personal online data repository is unique because only the user determines which information can be accessed and what type of information.
An entity shall refer to it as "personal powers by means of data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has a Bērners-Lie, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some external developers hired to work on the project, and a voluntary encoder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Burner-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change, turning all their business models completely over one night.
"We don't require their permission."
In an article published on Saturday by "Medium", Burners-Lee said that "Inrupt" "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on "Solid".
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lie has had an influential opinion in discussions about net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, Global Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am truly optimistic about this new era of the web," applied Burners-Leigh.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victoria Cross during World War I
For 100 years, the city’s hometown has celebrated the fact that the only clergyman of the Church of England has received Victoria’s cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lt. Colonel Bernard Vence received this award on September 29, 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglisei and Lehaukorta.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him in Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons Michael Vann said that it was "excellently symbolic" that such stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Venn conducted his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the huge fires of very thick mist and guns and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the firing line, and with the greatest courage led the line ahead of the area of guns, where three militias were defeated.
Colonel Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Venus (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I would never be able to do, and which at the same time is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, were also exposed to the crown orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Venus claimed that he felt "encouraged by participating in this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is reflected in the support provided by many people".
MMA fans were waiting all night for Bellator 206, but instead, the Piggy Pepe was waiting for
Imagine spending the whole night on the top to see Bellator 206, but at the end of the day you have been denied this main event.
In San José, 13 battles were included, including six main cards broadcast live throughout the night in the UK Channel.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to join each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised by changing the transmission to Piggy Pepu.
Some were in a situation of misunderstanding when the whole night was awake until the dawn while waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change in the transmission to children's cartoon as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 this type of content is unacceptable, therefore the switch to the children's program took place," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues.
"Swine Peppa," "Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said that he would work on schedule planning so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about the repetition of the transmission, I think we can do something about it," said Cocker.
"But the clock there is six morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switch and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was not the case, and it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem next time.
We're going to keep up with five fights, not six (as has been up to now). We tried to make fans happy, but we tried.
It's a failure."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Tom Daley claims that he was raised with less value than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
While visiting the first radio 4 programme "Desert Island Discs" led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had started talking about homosexual rights to give others a "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning in the Olympic Games.
Krety Young, the permanent head of the long - term program, has spent several months resting on illness.
When she appeared out of Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt "less than others" as she grew up, because "in the company it is not assumed that both girls and boys can like."
He said, "To today's feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driving force that gave me strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" so that people would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympic Bronze Medal has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Friendly Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, "sudden into unprepared".
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar Prize winner last year, claiming that the age gap was never an obstacle.
"When you have passed so much through so little age" (his first Olympics were 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone in your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, all that was important to me was the acquisition of gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? In life are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby."
His son, Robert, has the same name as his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Dale was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him she won't be there anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to put in front of the housemates in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first song — Heather Small performed by Proud, who resonated with him on the way to achievements in the Olympics and continues to invade the goose.
The "Desert Island Discs" program can be heard on Sundays of BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 after British summer time.
Michaelson, who left the form, made the reserve in the playout of the Saturday Raider Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Raidera Cup, but he will need to change his strategy in order to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
For the 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk, who is taking part in a two-year championship, landed on a reserve bench for the Saturday four ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it has often been in connection with US teams, the five-time winner divided his day, acting as both a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what will depress him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense battle in the "Le Golf National" rough course, where irregular hits are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, Michelson will fight the precise British open championship winner, Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind, successfully take the lead at the start of 12 single-game match, Mikelson Macch could be crucial.
Furik expressed his confidence in his teammate without unnecessary words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, took me by his back, put his hand on me and said that tomorrow will be ready," said Furik.
"He is very sure of himself.
He is an outstanding sportsman who has given so much to these teams earlier and this week.
I think I hadn't imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything turned in the way it turned in, and we'll count on it.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mikelson will give Nick Faldo the record of the most played match in the Raidera Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Raidera Cup's career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has gained 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven undistributed games, although Furik claimed that his presence brought some intangible benefits to the team.
"He is fun, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun about people, and he is a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the latest players liked to arouse him also this week, which was fun watching.
He gives much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European sample knows that leadership of significant protagonists can quickly disappear
The European team's captain, Thomas Bjorne, knows from experience that taking a significant step forward in the fight for the Raidera Cup in the last day's singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dan was debuting in the 1997 games in Valderram, where the team of opponents, whose captain was Steve Ballesteros, won a five-point victory over the Americans, but only now got to the finish line with a very small point of victory: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were well placed to take the lead in Valderram; we were set to take the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only with little weight," said Bjorne (in the picture), after the 2018 Group's victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, promulgating in the lead in 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
So history will show me and every member of that team that nothing has come to an end.
Tomorrow you will give yourself everything.
Go to the square and show your best performance!
It will not end until the resulting points are visible on the screen.
Our aim is to get this trophy, and let us focus on it.
I have always said that I am focusing on 12 players on our side, but we are very well aware of what is happening on the other side – the world's greatest players."
Lightened by the performance of his players in the golf course, Bjorne added: "I never rejoiced early.
New challenges await us tomorrow.
Tomorrow individual games, and that's a completely different thing.
It's great if at times when everything goes well, you have a partner next to you, but your golfer's skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message must be passed on to your players, i.e. to give them everything in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team, Captain Jim Furick will see to it that his players show their best performance directly in individual and not partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of the tournaments of these important last days — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a result of the defeat that European teams have achieved — a sensational success that they later know as "Miracle at Medinah" in the golf world.
"I remember every fucking word," he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, joined his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the rapid breakthrough that you have experienced in Brooklyn, the one you have experienced in Medina.
When this impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a great pressure for medium-sized games.
We created our composition accordingly and ranked the guys in the way we thought we were right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy as the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pointer in the first part of the list.
"I put the guys in this order, because I think it best fits in with the tournament," said Bjorne in relation to the chosen single-game players.
Postponing the entry into service of the new German military vessel
The latest fregate of the German military fleet was to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the ageing Cold War warships, but it will not happen at least until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, it was reported by local media.
The entry into service of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, as reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a representative of the military sector.
The ship should have joined the military fleet in 2014, but unpleasant after-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the warflot in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen class fregates.
They are expected to be equipped with powerful guns, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it must be possible to deploy new fregates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the warships of the latest technology, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries, will already be out of date until they enter into service, in the note "Die Zeit".
The failure of F125 last year was seen in all the headings when the German military fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the military fleet returned to the yard after the ship was delivered.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this, but the German media mentioned a number of significant 'software and equipment defects' that would make warships invalid if it were to be used in a combat mission.
The software weaknesses were a particularly important factor, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is only half of the oldest Fregades of the Bremen class.
It also proved that the vessel has too much weight, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the military fleet to make improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7000 tonnes of heavy ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to erroneous hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
The cost is said to have reached €3.1 billion instead of the initially estimated €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new fractates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy will fall.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the warfloat really 'beyond ships'.
According to the official, this problem has become much worse over time, as old ships are removed from operation and new ones are not delivered on site.
He regretted that none of the Fregettes of the Baden-Württemberg class had joined the warflot.
National Trust listens to the life of the secret bats
A new study conducted in a Scottish highland is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in their future protection measures.
Inveve gardens in Westeros, scientists from Scotland "National Trust" will study pundurs, pigmey bats, as well as brown long shorts and water-night bats.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations, which will track the bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species are carrying out specific activities.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behaviour of the bats.
The NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as setting up meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last 100 years, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting the loss of bat shelters and settlements.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as do sheeting paper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as attacks on cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night - hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes during hunting.
They use a complex resonator-location method to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check bats and sometimes even rescue work.
Even the organization has set up the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland "Threave" in possession of Damfries and Galway, where eight of the ten bat species in Scotland live.
The property manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideal for bats.
"Here is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are plenty of things that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
He emphasises that it is important to check whether bats are staying in the area before carrying out the property maintenance work, because one female hiding house may be killed by up to 400 females and their young, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, obstructed or destroyed by their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Preservation Trust, has invited the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species, we just don't know how they are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape by ordering lawyers to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned him as a 'false news' in his rape, claiming that people "will pay attention to themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these statements.
The Portuguese-origin and Turin Juventus football star is accused of rape by Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he paid the woman $375,000 to keep silent on this incident, so on Friday, he said, "Der Spiegel."
A few hours after these statements were made, Ronald, 33, contacted their 142 million followers via Instagram video, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the fifth "Ballon d'Or" winner said in the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous for my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's okay," the player added to smile.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronald lawyers are going to sue the magazine "Der Spiegel" for the statements they have made, which they have called "the provision of unacceptable information on the grounds of suspicion in the area of privacy".
A lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the individual in recent years".
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the "suite" class of the "Palms Hotel and Casino" hotel in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted by Nevada State Clark District Court, it is reported that after dating to the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the hotel number of the player, where he had an anally raped woman.
Majorga says that after this incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent "good boy"" but fell under the temptation of this "one percent".
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this happened by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of injuries taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34 - year - old woman claims that she does not want to accept the terms of this settlement any more because the incident has left a permanent injury.
At the time when the above statements were made, Ronald was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer about 100 million euros went to the Italian chain Juventus.
Bruxit: United Kingdom "deplorable" car manufacturers lost forever
"The United Kingdom will "repent it forever" if it loses its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit," said business secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disturbed" by the fact that the company Toyota UK has announced "BBC" that if Britain leave the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the Burnstone plant near Dorbia.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the delay at the borders in the case of Brexita could unagreed put the job on the game.
Last year, the Toyota model plant Auris and Avensis produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other EU Member States.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about exiting the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit will close his mini-work facility in Oxford for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the threatened supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexita.
Toyota's production line is based on the principle of time, where cars manufactured on demand have parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border that could lead to delays and shortages in parts.
According to the company "Toyota" it would not be possible to detain more than one day worth of inventory at its Dērbishir factory, so it would be necessary to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the exit plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU has been 'precisely calculated to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We need an agreement," he said, "We want to reach the best agreement that would allow us, as I would say, to benefit not only at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity."
"It is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we need to be able to continue fully with the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota could not tell you how long production could be stopped, but warned that the increasing costs in the long term would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working in Bournestone for 24 years and has been operating in the factory as a union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly worried: "I can say from experience that once a post disappears, it does not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports White House
The important meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "deputed for another week", because the fight against the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno continues, it was reported by the White House on Sunday.
Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in Russian elections, the link between the means employed by Trampa and Russia, and possible violations of the rule of law by the President, is being monitored by Rosenstein.
For months in Washington, the question has been whether Trump will release the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of negotiations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where he was humiliating about his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that Rosenstein would not be released "more well", but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict with hearing of the Senate Committee of Courts, in which both Kaveno and one of the women accused of committing their sexual abuse – Dr. Kristīne Bleij Forda.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation into the accusations made by Kaveno, continuing to delay the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trampa Press Secretary, visited Fox News Sunday.
She replied about the meeting of Rosenstein: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that happen around the Supreme Court.
But we will see it, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not carried out a press release of the White House since 10 September.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of serenity is not related to the dislike of the television reporter "popular honors", although she added, "I do not deny the fact that they are a sacrifice of praise."
She then proposed a direct contact between Trump leading to an increase in the press interest.
"The president gets involved in more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," she said and, without providing more information, she added: "We are interested in the number."
Sandersa argued that it would be easy to keep going, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it is undoubtedly better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do a lot of this, and you see that we have done a lot in recent weeks, and it will take place instead of the press when you can talk to the President of the United States."
The tram regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President showed the reason for this in New York this week by giving an uncontrolled and sometimes strange expression to the reporting population.
Health Minister writes to EU staff in Scotland NHS on the fear of Brexit
The Minister for Health has signed up to EU staff working with the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish to stand for Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to the MSS less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of permanent applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Framen wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal leading to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues, both inside and outside the EU, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit the patients and communities we take care of.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After the head injury, Christian Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation
The state of Tennessee "Tigers" guard Kristienne Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation following a head injury, which he got during the Saturday game, which resulted in 31-27 concessions to "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported "Tennessean" sports reporter Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the main coach of the state in Tennessee, told the reporters that the injury was not long before half an hour ago.
"He came to the side line and it said collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sidelines, the coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, put him on the ramps and take him for further investigation.
A state official in Tennessee told Nashville, WSMV reporter in Tennessee, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie was removed from the medical center of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that for the time being "there is no information about the type/severeness of injury", and the team of the state of Tennessee is trying to understand when this injury was received.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after Ilionis was replaced by a team of the state of Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had generally carried out five blocks, which in this season compiled a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national levy when buying property in the UK, and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
This will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased national levy will apply to persons who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects that up to 120 million pounds can be collected per year to be channelled to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national levy when buying property in the UK and transferring the received extra funds to help the homeless, it will notify Teresa Maya today.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralise the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at better prices and to address the most prosperous part of society.
The increased national levy will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, with additional money being allocated to government efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national fee, including the introduction two years ago of a higher fee for the purchase and rental of a second home, could amount to as much as three per cent.
The Treasury foresees that such a step can complement its budget by up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built London property is purchased by non-residents, thus touching prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access their homes.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "poc cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the public levy so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing land without using it, and urged Mrs Meja to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to address the problem of British housing.
Mr Corbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on the control of rental and set-aside without reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new housing.
She said: "Last year, I mentioned that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore Britain's dream: that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means sorting out the housing market that we have damaged.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and set up their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and persons not living in the United Kingdom and those who work hard in Britain.
For many, the dream of home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homeless people is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to drive Scotland
Jack Ross, the head of the Sunderland, says that his biggest goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which is currently the third place in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he moved back to State of Light after St Mirren was brought back to Scotland's premiere last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B cup, and that was all," Ross said for the Scottish BBC Sportsund broadcast.
"But I grew up, with my father watching "Scotland" games in Hampden's park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in managing the club."
Her predecessors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of "Alloa Athletic" claims that he has not been worried by following the heads of such a large club-recognised managers, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsviča.
"My success will now be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the premiere.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits in with the premiere," he said.
"Returning the club's premiere won't be an easy task, but I'm probably going to think that I'll only be successful here when it's done."
Ross is only the third year in his career as a deputy director in Dumbarton and spends 15 months as "Hearts" coaches.
After that he helped the club "Alloa" recover from falling to the third level and during the same season helped "St Mirren" to get the title of the champion.
Ross states that it feels much more comfortable at the moment than during his career in the club "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkrik", "St Mirren" and "Hamylton Academic".
"They probably were true crossings," he remembers, taking responsibility over "Alloa".
"I really believed that management was my real call — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange because I was successful, able to live from it and enjoy some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my place.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 5.30 a.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular flag to contaminate, but it has increased its pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that in July the sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, said: "Stop the sunny time and England's long-term participation in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, namely that the profitability of the pubs had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants had fallen.
The restaurants, which dropped by 1.8 percent in June, faced an even more difficult situation in July.
The situation was most grateful for the drinks in the pubs and bars, as they experienced a much greater upturn than restaurants experienced a downward trend.
The food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out to a drink.
The monthly sales of beverages in the cages and bars increased by 6.6 percent, while the sales of food decreased by 3 percent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sporting events are the main factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the relevant period of the previous year will be particularly painful to the additional continuous cost pressure.
With regard to food providers, long and hot summers could not come at an even more inappropriate moment, and time will show whether the moderate temperature that we normally experience in August will provide the much-needed relief."
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 percentage points in July, reflecting the decrease in sales volume of the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a UK sales monitor for the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyses data from 47 groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion and has become an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from its parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This information raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show to their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of false profiles on Instagram’s photo-sharing site is growing rapidly.
This information raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "clean main" account to show to parents and also private accounts.
One mother, who applied to her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them accepted maintaining private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers make up online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilida Doila will be a "light voice" on the Scottish Lightweight Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Scotland.
Doila is the most award-winning space and outdoor cellar in Scotland, and President Ian Beatie described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to use her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"The Elylyde is given great respect throughout the entire community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's passenger theatres, and we are sure that Scotland's lighthouse will gain a huge amount of lighthouse, with their involvement on the board," said Betty.
Doila said, "I want to act as a "light voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help guide this sport in Scotland."
An American who won a 200-metre and 400-metre race in the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, thus gaining four Olympic gold medals in total, and currently has a regular BBC pandemic, was unable to pass after a temporary ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors claimed that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I can already do a good job!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Opinions share advertising of a breast milk pump comparing mothers with cows
A breast milk pump company has provided for online sharing of views on advertising that compares feeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to mark the release into circulation of the so-called "the world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company "Elvie" released an advert for a sticky bottle to demonstrate the freedom offered to breastfeeding mothers by the new pump.
Four true mothers dance in a walled cowhouse at a song whose words sound like this: "Yes, I'm wasting myself, but you don't see any tail," and "if you haven't noticed, they're not the udder, they're my breasts."
The recuperation goes on: "Escap, escap, I feed the babies, escap, escap, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a wide range of resonance online.
The 77 000 times viewed and hundreds of times commented video have received shared comments from viewers, and many say that this highlights the dread of the dairy industry.
"It is a very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they have to become tough and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively belongs to breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to promote a breast milk pump for mothers who can keep their baby?"
It also said, "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended advertising, and one woman admitted that in her opinion the song was "excite".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I'd buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
The extraction of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea.
This is an excellent product," wrote.
Another comment states: "It is a fun ad for mothers who wash off milk (not in workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "cow".
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertising, a group of women discover that they all dance with unobtrusive pumps placed in their chests.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that many women who wash milk claim to feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, it has no wires and pipes, and it is indistinguishably part of the breasts for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep little ones and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin's partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative placing on the market.
We wanted to draw attention to milking, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the sense of freedom that the new pump will bring, in parallel between women who are milk-leasing and dairy cows."
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump pump has come to the center of attention.

Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to the tent town on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased rapidly, although the border has been crossed by a relatively large number of people each month, as before, and this has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policy pursued by the Trump administration, which has made it difficult for children to stay with sponsors.
As a rule, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing that when they openly apply for a child, this would threaten their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take off their fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other authorities involved in immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs law officer, showed that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be sponsors of unaccompanied minors before the convention.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had not been fined in advance.
"Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors, are staying there illegally, and a large part of these persons are criminal aliens.
We therefore continue to pursue such persons," said Mr Albens.
According to asylum workers, in an attempt to deal more quickly with children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to come to court within one month of the arrest and not after 60 days, as the previous standard provided for.
Many will use the opportunity of a videoconferencing call instead of coming personally to defend their legal status before the judge in immigration matters.
Persons deemed unfit for release will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, has been reported according to information and evidence from asylum workers extracted from the system in recent months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns will be exacerbated in larger sites, such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often overlooked because of their expanse.
They added that the relocation of children to the town of tents, without taking enough time to prepare them emotionally or allowing them to say goodbye to their friends, could lead to injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the U.S., French and Turkish "ocupant armies" to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must immediately and unconditionally resign," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, 'the war against terrorism has almost ended'.
He stated that Damascus would continue to fight "in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", and that both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both the Kurd forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the circumstances were great for them to return and blamed "separate Western countries" for "dispersal of irrational fears", which makes refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicising what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the reconstruction of the country before an agreement on ending the war is concluded between Asa and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the last pillar of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack on a province of three million people by the Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has certain time limits", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new Committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, with a view to drawing up the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the work of the group should be limited to "revising the articles of the existing constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected to the 2020 elections unless, and probably awaited by, many liberal observers, an empire and a scandal, they will not prematurely put an end to his Presidency.
And then "it will be the most dramatic end of the Presidency all the time!"
At the moment, there is no indication of the relaxation of the observers.
Since 2014, ratings in the most favourable CNN transmission have more than doubled to 1.05 million spectators, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million spectators.
Fox News shows 2.4 million viewers at the most favorable transmission time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, informed by Nielsen, MSNBC "The Rachel Madlow Show" is in the top place in cable rating with 3.5 million key news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the pillar of ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama tells of the secretary of the Cabinet, who becomes president after the attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, composer-veteranist and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club has his own theory.
She remembers the trip with a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "Because he smiles me," said Ms. Scott.
Haos is to some extent entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou judgment in the Form case, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being informed to the citizen when at 6 p.m., we discuss the expert group on how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book Fear, Paul Manafort 15 thousand dollars worth of bomber-type jackets from stupendous feathers and leather ("the clothes from which arrogance is sucking," declared Washington Post) and the role that Stormy Daniels will play in his passionate description of Trampa, so to speak, the anatomical details.
For example, I will never again take Super Mario as before.
"Part of what he does that creates the impression of the reality show, is that he has given you information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" show explained the variable team of the Trampa show and the daily turns (the Chinese with N.F.L., Kim Chenun's praise).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because otherwise you'll be behind.
When I got to Fleis this week, time on the north coast of Kauai was sunny,80 degrees (~27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in premises where he watched MSNBC broadcast while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not at the time when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Committee on Justice and his future in the Supreme Court is threatening to escalate.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "it was the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money comes from outside into the election campaign of the most intense parliamentary interim elections
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress constituency of Pennsylvania is seeking money through the transformation of Congress districts, which will result in two existing Members fighting for one seat.
This recently modified outskirts of Pittsburgh is linked to the representative of the Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different area in the special elections last spring.
Lemb will fight with the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th area.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the maps were recycled.
Competition in the new area 17 has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely held March elections in the 18th Congress.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won it with 20 points.
The political experts foresee a slight majority for the democrats.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese support, but then considered
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without great pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners placed the management team of the Trampa organization behind the door.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "no decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", its representative, Heather Nauert, stated in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received around 140 million amounts from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support, was considered to be fined.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and the number of murders have reached the highest level.
In the course of its internal meetings, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an approach to prevent the migration of migrants to the US.
In mid-September, the State’s senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, with a complete end to the sentence of El Salvador.
The diplomats were informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration highlights the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debate that had been described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in the internal negotiations if their anonymity had been preserved.
His story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying history
The second stone garden could include a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trampa may have hindered justice, which has a great deal of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has co-operated secretly with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party wins the Congress, Trump will have to answer to this structure and perhaps also to the jury of his fellow members right when he is going to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I did not claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that will have to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid blood alcohol that lasted for years.
History is turning around such turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What can we do if Mr Trampa releases Prosecutor General Rhod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr Miller's investigation?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein to have been told that last year he proposed to secretly record the discussion with the President and to think about his ineligibility for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times's story is not accurate.
"How do we answer that the FBI investigation about Bret Kaveno just requested will not be complete or honest or that he will be approved as a judge of the Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and his credible accusations of sexual assault?
And what is most important, will we vote in the mid-term elections of the Congress, which will call Trump to account?
If we do not meet all these challenges, we will have a long winter for democracy.
But I believe that we will succeed in referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish, who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once in my office.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later she sent me to light up the Sabbath candles on a table with swastic.

The "Rangers" star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the fight against Vienna's "Rapid"
Rangers will welcome Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive unsharped game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
Road trauma prevented the center's attacker Graham Dorans from re-entering the season's games until the undistinguished result with 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can be used as a trample to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this because "Villarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We went into the game believing that we'd be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them at the end of the day, but in general, it is a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half of the year, but we had a better team in the second half of the year.
And there will be another important night for Europe on Thursday.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
Last year with all my injuries and changes in the club was clearly heavy, but now there are new colds that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the workout is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women can't sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents knew clearly what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with their family members.
About half of individuals in a national study indicated that they do not talk to a spouse's friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't do anything to talk about it," reveals Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for your need for care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial consultant involved. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with the sum of money to cover these costs, or the provision of their assets, the most important thing for you to have money.
Develop your legal instruments.
Converse an authorised person on health matters so that you can have a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that your specialists act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to express them.
Consideration should also be given to the possibility of granting power to finance.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of the payment of your bills if you are unable to do so by yourself.
And remember the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency assistance.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you.
"And this is not only about finances, but also about who is a doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan is in place."
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man received several shots with an air gun, going at night at home.
The 40 - year - old victim was in Ilfracombe Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
The police described the shooting of the BST around 2.30 a.m. as "random".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday have killed at least 384 people.
Because of the devastation of communications, the rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the area of Dongala, north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnified earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here's the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived there in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area of about 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children under 18 years old.
Fisheries and farming are the backbone of the central province of Sulawesi's economy, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the side coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Pall and Dongal have suffered several tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunamis also blew over the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring where earthquakes are formed regularly.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami in 14 countries on 26 December killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumantra in late March and early April.

Arrested by the oldest son of Sarah Peilin for family violence charge
Track Palin, former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska, the oldest son of Sarah Peilin, has been arrested because he has been accused of attack.
According to a report issued by the Alaska State Police (Alaska State Troopers) on Saturday, 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for family violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report on the crimes that she claimed had committed, he took her telephone.
Peline has been detained by Mat-Su in a pre-trial detention institution and has a security deposit of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he found himself guilty, he declared that "there was no fault whatsoever".
Peilin has been accused of three Class A offences, for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of USD 250 000.
He has also been accused of a Class B violation, for which a day-long prison sentence and a fine of USD 2 000 can be received.
This is not the first time that Peylin is accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Pelinen.
His mother, Sarah Peline, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
This case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
He was accused in 2016 of domestic violence, of delaying the report of domestic violence and of carrying a firearm in the context of this incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a stab in her face.
In 2016, the Veterans groups criticised Sarah Peilina for linking her son’s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from her service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors want to demand that the rarely used death penalty be imposed on a person suspected of having been subjected to a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in the city of New York, when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is said that 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle on the West Side Highway in October, where he hit pedestrians and a bicycle player on his way.
In order to justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipow "in intent" killed eight victims and "in intent" caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the statement of intent to request the death penalty before a court in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court's document, both of these charges could be sentenced to death.
During the weeks following the attack, the federal jury adopted an indictment of the arrest of Saipov in 22 charges, which included eight charges for murder for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges for cruelty and damage to motorised vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditated", explained the prosecutor, saying that the attack by Saipova was "supplementary, cruel and inhuman".
"Saifullo Habibulajevich Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov wounded, damaged and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Djego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anna-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Ernst Ferruch, Henry Diego Mendoza and Allehandro Damjan Pagnocco," wrote the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors of the South District Court of New York charged them with execution.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but in the end, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in the federal case in New York in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of participating in the spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple was executed in an electric chair.
According to court documents, during the days and months that he was born in Uzbekistan, Saipov did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he has told the investigators that he feels good about what he has done.
According to the indictment, Saipow told the officials that he had been inspired to attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested permission to place the flag of the ISIS in his Chamber.
He has rejected 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that he was "slightly naturally dissatisfied" with the accusation's decision.
"We believe that the intention to claim the death penalty instead of accepting the guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the injury caused to all the parties involved," Paton explained.
The Saipova Defence Team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the granting of a death penalty.
The Conservative declares that Mr Brexita should be entrusted with the management of the negotiations.
Nigel Faražs promised today a conservative conference to "mobilise the people's army".
The former British Independent Party leader stated that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the Members of the Teresa Meejo Parliament proposed that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone announced to the route in Birmingham that Britain would have left for a long time had Mr. Farazh been Minister.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Maya in trying to unify her controversial party was demonstrated by Conservatives who supported the EU and joined a separate city protest against Bruxita.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on future relations between the British and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and is being attacked by those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay in the EU and also by the EU itself.
The allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between her offer and Haosu.
Mr. Bone Means Leave, Mr. Solihull, announced that he wanted to throw out the "Meat" plan in the manure.
He proposed to make Mr. Faraža an ally and to entrust him with the talks with Brussels.
"If he had been to the saying, we would have already stopped," boun said.
The Wellingborough MEP added: 'I will support Brexite, but we must throw away the Masai plan!'
In support of his opposition in the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to have a handful!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr Bonun ignored the assumption that the public idea could have changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false'.
Andrea Jenkins, the supporter of Breksita, also took part in the march, and he said to the reporters: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In a report directed to May, she added, "Prime Ministers stay in their place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians in the accommodation should be under pressure if they are to ignore the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to put Bruxita down and we're here today to tell them we won't let him do it."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd, he goes on to say: "I want you to let our politicians who intend to hand over Bruxita feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the fight for Bruxita, and never let us relax until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Leavers walked through Birmingham before a two-hour residence took place in the city center.
Insidious activists welcomed the Conservatives against the Brexita banners after the group meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers' Party, laughed at the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, the whole border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider the candidate of the U.S. President
wish. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will "consider the" candidate for the US presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the democrat of Massachusett talked about her future in the city hall of Western Massachusett.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that Mercedes's team's work will play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Botht started well and almost left it dry, defending his place on the first two trips and calling on Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fatel was the first to enter the garage and left it behind to deal with the others, which was likely decisive.
Mercedes's pilot was filling the circle later and back from Fettel, but Hamilton continued to stand up to the leaders after a reconfiguration of the forces that saw Ferrari's driver persevered, risking falling behind after a double manevre to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row and at the end of the first round was the seventh day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was running a large part of the race, because he focused on tires to quickly reach the finish and overturn Kim Raiconen in fourth.
After all, he arrived in the garage in April 44, but he was unable to increase the speed of the remaining eight circles because Raiconen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one and two," he said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senators Diane Feinstein at her perseverance not to disclose her letter from Christine Bleisy Ford, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno, for sexual harassment.
Speaking at the meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not specifically talk about the Forda testimonial that she gave to the Senate's legal commission, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "poor, intrusive and untrustable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that already happens in the past few days in the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, evil, uncomfortable and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information, and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you tear down the document? – "Oh, what did you do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a second.
Whether we did it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail what Forda accused Caveno, and in early September, the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Forda's accusations, I "not tearing away" her story, "Feinstein said to the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it."
But her denial did not like the President, who commented on this situation at his Saturday evening: "I'll tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President proposed that democrats use accusations for their benefit.
"They are purposeful to regain power by any means."
Do you see evil, trouble, they don't care what they're hurting, what they have to destroy to gain power and control," the President says, "Mediaite".

The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised for being a hero after he sacrificed himself to make a flight with hundreds of passengers safely take off land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a severe earthquake shocked the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The area will continue to be heavily dumped and many are trapped in mud in Pala.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu Airport, which swung heavily.
He remained in his position to make sure that on the aircraft Batik Air Flight 6321, which at that time was on the runway, would safely take off in the air.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it could collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
An Indonesian air navigation representative, Johannes Sirait, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Baikpapan, Kaliman, to bring him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are saddened when we hear it," he's filled.
In the meantime, the public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, and the public disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butango (Boutong) is limited.
"It is to be seen that a beautiful increase will be made, as many bodies of people are under the rubble and many cannot access," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the agency.
The 6 - foot [6 m] - high Vilnius destroyed Pala, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes continue to provide assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, Sky News said: "Every minute, the ambulance service brings new victims.
Clean water is a shortage.
Small shops have been reloaded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia came to Pala and the national military brought him: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Already this year, Indonesia was shocked by earthquakes in Lombarda, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane Disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Nugini" says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane disaster in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight, during which it landed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people had disappeared, even though previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Nugini announced in the press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline stated that it works with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local people helped save other passengers and crew by boat after the plane fell into the water trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
Officials, Friday, said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline stated that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, all of them in a stable state.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after the takeoff of the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway was overstated.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane by means of emergency exits because the water was just up to their waist.
He said that he fell panic and shouted, and that he had a slight head injury.
Marine seafarers in the United States, who worked nearby, also helped to improve the ship’s quay by means of an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sinked about 30 feet (100 feet) under the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG registered airlines in the last twenty years, no one is associated with Air Nugini.
A psychoalyzing commentator explains the course of events at night in which a live woman was burned
On Saturday, the appeal provided evidence in the re-examined case, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, commentator of the US Department of Judicial Expertise, showed him for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He set out to the jury how he used information from the phone to put together the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Telis and the 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said that he had received location data from several phones, which suggests that Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers at the time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford at the courtroom showed that he was not in town that day.
When the charge asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "false because my car was in Nashville."
Another coincidence was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they knew each other only a week.
Rovlet said that a little after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted the text messages, calls, and contact information received from Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted him from his life," said Heil.
The defences are scheduled to provide their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the trial would be passed on to the jury later on the same day.

Black again?
In New York the babysitter has sued a couple for dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York the babysitter has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she has received an erroneously sent text message from the mother who complained that the babysitter "remains black again."
The couple denies that it would be a racist, equalising the trial to "extortion".
Lindsija Plasko-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her rejection by learning that the new childcare provider, Gizele Maurīsa, is black when she came to work the first day of 2016.
"IN THE FUTURE OF THE FUTURE, THE FUTURE, "Plasko-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice.
Aware of her industriousness, the "sumptuous" Plasko-Flakesman's discount for Maurice, pointing out that their former fiancée, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had waited for a Filipino, referring to New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent her home with Uber.
Now Maurices has sued the court for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for a job with secured living, for which she had initially applied and without an employment contract.
"I want to show them that there are no such things," she said on Friday, "Post", adding, "I know it is discrimination."
The couple rejects the accusation that they are racists claiming that the cessation of Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after her insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not a racist," Joel Plasco, a man, said the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it was just because of error?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
By placing the court sitting on "extortion", Plasko said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"Do you really treat someone in this way?
This is not acceptable," the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are still under way, public opinion in the courts quickly cross social networks, deplorating them of their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put yourself in the shoes" who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very surprising now to learn what we know about Paddington's great success."
When she said that her father, who had worked as an operator at BBC before feeling the inspiration to write a book for children about a little toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet bitter" after Father's passing through the age of last year.
As for Paddington, who is called a "very important family member", her father was silently proud of his potential success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and wasn't a great man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like if you had a child who achieves something: you are proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merits to Paddington himself."
I had to phone away my dying daughter
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors struggled constantly for her life.
"No one called on a regular basis and said that she was very bad and expected to not survive," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she will die in the next two minutes and I have to say no to her.
And I did.
I said, "You know, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even more quickly, and it all ended now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I couldn't catch or scream because I was in a situation where there are families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to control."
After all, then already the loss of her daughter, Edna-Laperuz, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears run all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Matching women attach cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide act to help others not to lose their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelie Hamphrey strengthen the cards at the Wellsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davies’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want someone older to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydia, said that her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him by smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he gave up his job before he died because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at that time, was the one who found him after Tyler's suicide.
Davies said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis created cards "to tell you that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to stay silent – you have to talk."
Hamphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, his spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he would feel sad or be depressed or in any other way," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning – when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
His death was a major injury to children, but they have to deal with it: "It irritates the whole family.
That's what we're gonna do.
But we all need to go on and fight."

The future of Britta Kaveno hangs in the air, because the FBI opens an investigation
"I think that if we could really get what he requires – in terms of time and scope in the limited investigation – we could possibly achieve a small consensus," Fleyk said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission "parts" between the fortified partisan force.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republics do not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is only a coincidence.
The interelections are five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicns are expected to fail, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the Supreme Court.
George Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked at the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where now 51 seats belong to the Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, vice-president, to decide the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has reduced the number of North Korea's political asylum seekers
North Korea's political asylum seekers in South Korea have fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Merger Ministry said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when they were 2706.
Park said that stricter border controls are key factors for North Korea and China and high rates for human smuggling.
Pyongyang did not provide any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them are travelling through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross it than the heavily protected DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them in a forced manner.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which remain technically ward, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, both leaders met Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when they agreed to cooperate on big trains to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions since there was no progress in these negotiations.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally arm the first," said Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno "historic" and claims that he is unfit for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Court’s minority, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate of the Supreme Court Breta Kaveno "historic" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi gave comments during the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Ostin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would call her "historic," said Pelosi about their response to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kaveno was emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment by Dr. Kristina Bleisium Ford when they were both teenagers.
In its initial argument, Capene was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and teaching, talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the Democrats present in the Commission, calling against him the accusations of 'hortesco and the destruction of a harmonious nature', organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost his presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she considered that Kaveno's testimony is a justification that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with such statements and treatment as he is dealing with the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Kaveno if she had been approved and if democracy had acquired a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he is not suitable for a post not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in an existing court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, now, is a judge at the Washington District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way as a conservative judge.
In his approval talks, Kaveno passed questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not a good moment for a hysterical and two-to-one man to work in court, but we'd expect us to be happy to say, "Is it not wonderful?" said Pelosi.
But women have to hold on to themselves.
It's denunciation, months and years all shouted "over the edges," but she's not allowed to get it from herself out of weeping.
"We weep when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinemas to me in 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "One time, I was very helped by a woman who was a manager in a company who said that she also cried when she was angry, but formed a technique — when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great."
Asparas only recognise as a form of anger discharge in part because they are misunderstood on their own merits.
One of my most vivid memories is the older work, which expressed the proportion of men when I cried once because of my inexplicable anger when an older woman, a self - lenient manager (women), who was always a little afraid of me, drew me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see that weep!" she told me.
"They don't know you're over.
They think you're sad and they're just happy that you've managed to get under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then the US Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his election as President of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in an extramarital relationship, left the ship, also called a fool-making, and left the elections, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she could not stand as President.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"Watching was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted another to appear.
There were those who called it "Snow-white and seven beards."
She was late in the campaign, she was late in collecting funds and promised that she would not take part in the elections unless USD 2 million were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she said in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to collect money and speak to voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "depressed".
"You'd think I had a nerve breakdown," recalled Shreder how the press responded to him.
"You'd think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my tombstone.
"She cried."
Why the U.S.-China trade war can be a favorable Beijing
The main excuses for how the trade war between the US and China began are hidden and, while the fight is not over, differences between countries can be favourable Beijings in the long term, according to experts.
President Donald Trump issued his first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation started this week with new rates affecting the value of $200 billion (150 billion) of items exported to the US from China immediately.
Beijing also responds every time, the latest is five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has announced that it is committed to respond to the US one against one and that it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could wake up.
For Washington to resign, certain requirements should be met, but the public clandestine of the United States would be too shameful for the Chinese President Xiji Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision has been made quickly, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than those previously recognised by observers," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at New American Security, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, declared by the Foreign Minister.
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been in war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"At present, the situation on land is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the territory destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept help in the reconstruction of the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to sponsor unrest.

The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, which was probably the last Raider's cup.
Eight Raidera Cup veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't control tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am truly grateful that he has highlighted me and believed me.
I'm very, very happy we've got the cup back.
It's a team's merit and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotionally after a European victory.
He goes on to give his compatriot John Ram, who won U.S. golf legend Tyger Woods on Sunday with 2 against 1 in one single game.
"The pride that I feel when I won Taiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23-year-old young Rams.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raidera Cup.
Unaccustomed statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 top golf tournaments, while the other behind Jack Nieds.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find its opportunities, except Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furick of the U.S. team said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players took a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and US Raidera Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to tap your hats.
We won."
