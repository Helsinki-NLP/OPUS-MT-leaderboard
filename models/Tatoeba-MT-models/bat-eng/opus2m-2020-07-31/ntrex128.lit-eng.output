Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that "sees like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWh (e.g. Member of the Wales Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at political level.
One member of the "Working" Assembly said that his group was concerned, "so it is concerned with the "Twp" and "Pwp".
For the readers of Wales: "twp" means "silly" and "pwp" means "something".
A member of the "Plaid" Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
Welles Conservative claimed that his group was "open" for the change of name, but noted that it was a word shortening from MWP to "cell".
After all, the letter wis is said to be similar to the letter wis of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change its title, said: "The final decision on all the names of the Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for its members."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received strong support for the Assembly to call the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but in the context of the public consultation the MWP received maximum support.
The Assembly clearly offers alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present legislative proposals for amendments in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of the Assembly member and the committee framework plan.
During the legislative debate, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question as they should be called.
Macedonian people vote in a referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held in order to resolve a decade-long dispute with a neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscit on the change of name, the President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, said that he would not take the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, say that changing the name is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During the difficulties of Harlem, the bells of St. Martyn and other churches were silenced
“The older people I spoke to said that historically a bar and church could be found on every corner,” said Adams.
- You're not going to find one or the other today."
He said that he understood why the bars disappeared.
“Today people communicate differently, ” he said.
- Bars are no longer a neighbourhood site where people regularly gather."
When talking about churches, he is worried that money from the sale of property will not be enough for a long time, as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by multi-apartment apartments with co-operative apartments, where people will live that will not help the rest of the temples.
"The majority of people who buy co-operative apartments in these multi-apartments will be white," he said, "and will therefore finish the moment the churches close down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these co-operative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 in the white congregations, before Harlem became the black metropolis, the metropolitan community, and the St Martin's church was built ten years later.
The original cogregation of white methodists emerged in the 1930 ’ s.
Nearby, the black congregation that prepared the services took over the building’s name.
St. Martyn's church was taken over by the Cogregation of the Black with priest John Howard Johnson, who led the retailers boycott on 125th Street, the main store in Harlem, where blackmen were refused to be employed or appointed to a higher position.
In 1939 the building was very destroyed by fire, but since the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carijon.
The clergyman David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson, and the heir at St. Martyn's church, proudly called the wary bells of the poor.
The experts who closed the military in July called it in a different way – "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the world's first Carrillion played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind. 18 years ago he started playing a bigger Carrill at the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martyn's church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the past few months in St Martin's church was a difficult story about architects and contractors – some of them were invited by church worlds, others – the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristium is a parish management body made up of world leaders, and in July expressed concern to the bishop that the bishopy "will try to pass over the expenses" to the sacristy, although it did not employ architects and contractors sent by the bishopy.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark in California injured the 13th year of catching lobster
Officials reported that the shark had attacked a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday when he caught lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
He was attacked 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near the beach of Schyturi.
Chad Hammel San Diego's KSWB-TV broadcasts said he was divering with friends about half an hour before he heard a boy shouting for help, and then he came with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about getting an lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I was bitten by!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keybone had been plundered.
“I started calling everyone to climb out of the water: “A shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken on a plane to the Radio Children's Hospital of San Diego, where he was recognized as being in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in his report to the media that a shark was observed in that area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that he was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper body.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to hit the UK beauty market
Sainbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty chapters of department of departmental shop style, where specialists will work.
An active entry into the UK GBP 2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household goods are falling, the larger beauty units will be tested in 11 shops across the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investment in beauty is growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves, once meant for TV sets, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its range of beauty to 3 000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in trademark areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The shopping centre also releases its own Boutique range of makeup, most of which are vegan – increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, a perfume shop in France Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croidon, in South London, and the second one will be opened later this year in Sele Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities every day from the local essentials, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainbury's, said that the firm's sales shops are increasingly looking like department stores, because the supermarkets' networks are trying to deal with cheaper Aldi's and Lidl's shops offering more services and non-food products.
Sainbury's included Argos' sales shops in hundreds of shops and also installed a number of habitat's stores, because two years ago they bought both networks, which allegedly strengthened the sale of food products and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous shopping centre's attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy division ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 19th century Sainbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up in a dispute on how to distribute revenues from the shops of pharmacists in supermarkets.
The new strategy came about three years ago, for GBP 125 million, Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's network in 281 stores.
It was argued that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was added to the extended range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Trade at Sainbury's, said: "We changed the outside of the beauty chapters and the atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and because of its attractive environment and convenient places we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones is "swifted" because Holly Willoughby stopped with him a GBP 11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones "sent" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby interrupted a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their home and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old head of the "This Morning" program announced that he was leaving in Instagram's account.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable lifestyle brand for the last moment in order to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angry Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was “sent in” when during a hard meeting on Tuesday, a golden TV girl admitted at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Bakinghamshire that due to new transactions amounting to up to £1.5 million, she would no longer be able to spend time on his household items and accessories brand “Truly”.
The business was compared with Gwynth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was supposed to double the assets of H. Willoughby 11 million pounds.
Because in the 37-year-old Instagram account, Jones went from Great Britain to one of his summer homes.
Source said: “Truly” has so far been one of the most important Holly priorities.
This would be its long-term future, lasting for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was extremely surprised.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
Marlou has a full warehouse of ready-to-market goods."
Experts believe that the exit of the "The Morning" show leader, one of the most financially successful stars of Great Britain, may cost the company millions of investments in products, from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as due to delays in starting everything.
And that can be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby and T. Cappu founded Trily, and 52-year-old Jones joined the March as President.
The couple are on holiday together, and Mr Jones has 40% of the shares of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace ITV's I'm A Celebrity's leader Anta McPartlin.
A close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We talked hard, and "then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism of the media about the comment made, which some might regard as "non-presidency" and the fact that they are so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
A short voice of a curious "youth leader" said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been tight.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "appropriate response" from the US due to the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that the USA is continuing instead with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The short speech expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
- We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: this was the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American troops.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this stuffed arena, we’ll have about 200 people standing here,” said Trumpas, pointing to a crowd in front of him right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and the earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
In the event of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombardok were deployed, this was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so it is a little complicated," said Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" prepares a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
The representative of the National Disasters Agency, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu in order to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
In view of the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Despite the announced warning, the apparent lack of tsunamis in Palu is likely to lead to an increase in the number of lost lives.
It is difficult to travel between many islands of Indonesia at the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship deployed in Lombok, where victims of the earthquake are treated, sails to Pala, but it will reach the site of the new disaster at least three days later.
President Yoko Widod chose his election campaign centre to rebuild the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has not made the Josk administration restrain, as it will return to the elections in the coming years.
None is also under pressure from the continued tensions of sectarians in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1 000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other common weapons.
See: Livepool player Daniel Sturridge is killing a far-reaching equalization goal in a game with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the defeat at the Chelsea Premier League's 89-minute prize at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Saturday.
As their team had fallen behind the result of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He threw the ball on his left leg and hit the far side of the whirlwind.
High above the fine ground, the raised ball was flying to the right upper corner of the net.
He finally went over Kepa's shocked Arrizabalag and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get a ball and players like Shaq always play as far as possible ahead, so I was just trying to keep as much time as possible for the blow,” Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
- I saw Kant coming in, I fixed the ball with one touch and, without thinking too much, I just kicked."
After 25 minutes of the Belgian star Eden Hazard, the Chelsea goal was set at 1:0 from the first podium of the podium.
During that attack, the "blue" attacker returned the ball to Matheo Kovacius with his heel in the middle of the square and hurried towards the "Liverpool" side.
In the middle of this square, the wall was quickly played.
Then he sent the ball between the opposers to Hazard, who was raging the ground for the fine.
Hazardo overcame the defenders and directed the ball to the far side by the left foot of the gamer Alisson Becker through the Liverpool.
Liverpool team will play with Napoli at Stadio San Paolo (Italy) stadium in Naples at 15.00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea UEFA meets with videoton at 15.00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is already 832
As reported by the National Disaster Agency earlier Sunday, the number of deaths in Indonesia rose from the earthquake and tsunami to 832.
The agency’s press representative at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed due to the 7,5-point earthquake that caused the 6-metre wave on Friday.
The city of Palu, where more than 380 000 people live, was covered with ruined buildings.
The police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after the death of a woman under arrest
A homicide study was started this morning after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhed (Mersisaid).
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grason Muse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested for murder.
The police called on people who had seen or heard in the territory to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “As far as I am concerned, I would like to appeal to all who were near John Street in Berkenhed and saw or heard anything suspicious that they might contact us.
I would also like to contact everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could record someone in the video recorder and contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident in Berkenhed and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, my friends who know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Studies are still ongoing, as the police have reported that they inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grason Muse just tried to return to his apartment, but the police said that nobody could enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when he learned what happened.
The people are now informed that they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed to return home.
It was heard how a police officer explained to one person that the whole territory is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared to be horrified at the scene of the crime.
She always said, "It's so terrible."
At 14 a.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside side and another van – behind it from the outside.
Many officials stood on the inner side of the barrier and watched the multi-apartment block.
For any information requested to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Kromwell statues are being hit by the last blow to the 'rewriting of history' dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, which resembles the actions of the Taliban, under the responsibility of the fanatical followers of the Cromwell Puritans.
However, the Chromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crickas as "diversity" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the transfer of statues, Olivier Kromwell’s statue at Westminster’s Palace would inevitably have become a target.
Kromwell did not order or execute the iconoclazm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of an ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
The wonderful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Ham Thorneycrofto, is a reflection of the 19th century approach and a part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: "At the end of the 19th century, many people may have been more numerous than today, Kromwell was considered a defender of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate or not, historians have been arguing up to now.
One thing is clear: the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell has become an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worthy of mention and honor."
Swine killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in the southwest Chinese market, the pig was attacked and killed by the farmer.
On Sunday, Morning Post reportedly found a dead person whose name was Yuan. Due to the affected artery he was bloody and lay next to the hippopotamus market in the Guidzhou province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig grower in Sininga, China, was about to inject vaccine into pigs in the pig establishment.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan, he intended to travel to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, he found his relative dead and found an open door to a nearby gilder.
He said that there was a large hump in the ginger, whose mouth was darkened with blood.
According to the report, the study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 pounds [250 kg] had crushed a farmer.
“Guiyang Evening News” quotes: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, indicating his name Wu,
The camera filmed material showed Yuan, who entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found in about an hour.
Yuan or his cousin were not part of a man's fucking animal.
The market manager reported that the pig had to be locked in to stop attacking other people and keep until the police collect evidence on the ground.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to negotiate death compensation.
Although limited, human attack pigs have been reported in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] pressed the Wales farmer on the tractor and pressed it until the animal was driven away by a wife.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer, “CBC News”, told us that pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggressive may be caused by the taste of blood.
“They are just playful.
They love a biting, very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
The "residuals" of Uragano Roza will bring great rain to the USA in the south-west
The storm Rose is predicted to weaken by moving through cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring abundant rains to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5:00 a.m., Rosa moved at 137 km/h as a Category 1 storm and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenian Cape (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side is beginning to form an extended area of low pressure and is moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry a large tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 inches [25 cm] of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the coming low-pressure area, will in the coming days bring a wide-ranging rainy rain to the south-west.
Instead, from 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rain will cause a dangerous sudden flooding, a flood of debris, and a potential desert landslide.
The high humidity of tropical rains in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, will lead to a drop of between 5 and 8 centimetres per hour.
5–8 centimetres of rain is expected in south-west regions, especially in large part of Arizona.
Due to the fragmented nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are likely to occur.
As tropical storms rise, an extremely poor idea would be drawn to the desert on foot.
Strong canyons of rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and thunderstorms could lead to wind and dust jumps.
The nearing area of low pressure will bring some local heavy rain to the south coast of California.
It is likely that more than one centimeter of precipitation could cause a small stream of debris and that roads could become slippery.
This would be the first wet season precipitation in the region.
Some rains of tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Juta spread on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible in all of the US because the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to enormous temperature changes in small distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas City (Missour) and Omaho (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from that of Saint Louis and Di Moino (Iowa).
Over the next few days, summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern part of the United States, from the Great South Plains to the northeast, a warm October with a high temperature of 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 degrees Fahrenheit] is available.
In New York City, the temperature should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the east of the US will be higher than the average multiannual temperature in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanaugh court
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the statements of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and the accusations of the woman Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence in the 1980s.
However, the political impasse continued when broadcasters interrupted their regular programmes for the change of Friday's last minute: the senator of Arizona drew up an agreement for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Court Committee of the Senate that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was at the high school party, engulfed her and tried to put her on her clothes.
Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely sure that he was not.
On Friday, Nielsen announced that it was possible that more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching broadcast via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks, including PPS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating the number of persons watching television in the offices.
To explain this more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as that of the football matches or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the first of all networks, when the number of spectators reached an average of 5.69 million during a full-time court meeting.
ABC, reaching 3.26 million spectators, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had received 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million.
A great deal of interest remained at the end of the trial.
The main figure of Friday's drama was the Flake.
After the small Republican Bureau announced a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, when protestors shouted on him while trying to lift him to a meeting of the Court Committee.
CNN directly filmed him down in the face of people flooding.
“ I stand here in front of you, ” said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: "You have the power when so many women are powerless."
The Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, he added that he would have more to say at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Committee of the Courts voted in favour of the application of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
However, Flake said that it would only do so if he knew that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate that had been rejected in the coming week, the investigation of which was called on by a minority of democrats.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, there was some persuasiveness.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kavanaugh's failure to carry out an investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister blames critics for "playing politics" on "Brexit"
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Sunday Times of her plans to leave the European Union's critics "playing politics" with D. Britain's future and seeking to undermine the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In the next interview, published after her photo on the front page of the paper, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit's "Shaškių" plan that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs and said it was "totally absurd".
Extermination of Wayde Simso Police arrested the suspect Dytheon Simpson for the death of a LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of killing a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department reported that twenty-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and closed in prison, charged with a second-degree murder.
The officials published a video of Sims and Simpson's raging, and the police said that during the battle, Sims lost his glasses.
The WAFB branch of the CBS reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found on them the Simpson DNA.
After being interviewed, the police reported that he killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs us that his release security is $350,000.
On Friday, the expert service at the East Baton Rouge parish published a preliminary report that mentions the cause of death as a shot into the neck.
The section is dedicated to the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and district residents who helped during the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, Director of LSU Sports, thanked the district law enforcement for its “decentness and justice performance”.
Sams was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-story guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
Last season, the young man dropped 5,6 points on average during the game and caught 2.6 drop-off ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "sucked" and "shocked".
"This is always thought about," said Wade.
The Firemount was excavated in ash in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano came out of the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when increased activity of the crater was recorded and gas and ash emissions recorded over 24 hours 183 times.
The center has been watching many thunders and earthquakes.
The photos presented in the social media show car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Chochimilke, with a thin layer of ash.
The Geophysics have noted that the volcanic activity of 72 km southeast of the capital has increased since the Central Mexico earthquake hit the 7.1-point in September 2017.
The volcano, called Donu Goo, has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on the anniversary of independence, the police were in contact with the Catholic separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors hit the riot police and thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote against Catalonia on separation.
The riot police, which stopped a group of masked separatists, were covered with eggs and powder paints, which resulted in dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The police used sticks to stop the fights that started later in the day.
In a few hours, the group for independence, singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable", encountered Unionist protestors who shouted: "Let Spain live!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October in Madrid, which is considered illegal, but which is sunk by Catholic separatists who are seeking independence in the region, there remains a great deal of tension.
Most voters decided to become independent, but due to a large part of the votes, the turnout was low for those who did not want to separate.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1 000 people were injured during violent clashes when the police across the region tried to stop voting in the polling districts.
Independent groups established a camp on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who is involved in separatist protest with his wife, said that he is no longer certain about the prospects of Catalonia's independence.
“In the past year, we have experienced one of the best moments.
I watched the parents cry out joyfully to those who can vote, but we are now stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that a vital and hard-to-achievement victory in the regional elections in December last year has been plundered, Catalonia's independence parties have been hard to maintain their momentum this year when many of their most well-known leaders have resigned to voluntary exile or have been detained and are waiting for a court to play a role in organising a referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
After filming the protest on his phone, the police officer, who was 42 years old, said that he had brought the conflict to politicians on both sides.
“Volunteering is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Orioll Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders in prison in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidatisation in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression shown by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonder: Keep the men in the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after returning to London.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot with a dowel.
Menga’s impact assured the victory of Livingston 1:0 against Rangers
The first goal of "Livingston" player Dolly Menga guaranteed victory
Livingston, transferred to the upper league, surprised Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard, the manager of Ibrox club, to lose the second of 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be very important, because in a moment the Gary Holt team compared it with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team will meet with leaders Hearts next Sunday in this "Premier" League season, from which they fall behind in eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, Rangers will play at the European League's home with Vienna's Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of matches to six in a division, and Chief Trainer Holt has not yet felt the taste of defeat, because Kenny Miller has only changed it last month.
Livingston missed odds in games with Orthodox guests
The Holt team had to be in front of it long ago because of its perseverance, which is causing the various problems of Rangers.
At first Scott Robinson broke and hit across the gate, later Alan Litthgow slipped and failed to reach the head of Craig Halkett to the transferred ball, and he depreciated next to the gate.
Masters, allowing Rangers to play in the front, did not worry because they knew that they could make trouble for guests by creating standard situations.
That is exactly what the decisive goal was.
Rangers missed his free impact and Livingston started to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared their efforts to hand over the ball to Menga, who, after stopping it, won a goal from the middle of the fine.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers longer, but the defence of the owners has been insurmountable and the goal of the goal of the goal was almost non-existent to the goal of the goal.
Such a thief game continued in the second one, although Kelly had to work to counter the impact of Alfred Morelos on the gate.
Allan McGregor's goal was to shoot the Rangers shot at Scott Pittman, and after another Lithgow's standard position, the ball ran next to the gate.
The transfer was made to the Livingston penalty court, but every time two requests for a fine – one due to the contact between Halkett and Glenn Middleton after the change and the other due to the touch of the ball – were not satisfied.
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter at BBC Scotland, from Tony Maši Arena
Phenomenal Livingston game and result.
For all up to one, they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for a growing game.
The style of the game and the staff from the return to the upper league have hardly changed, but great merit should be devoted to the Holt, because when he arrived he lighted the team.
He was assisted by many heroes.
Captain Halkett, who focused on a well-organized defense, played a great role, and Menga made Menga value Connor Goldson and Joe Warralle stay alert.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play great under Gerrard, this time they lacked much to reach their level.
They had few decisive hits and only once broke through the defence of hosts. A certain worry call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
The Erdogan in Cologne was met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people from coming together in front of a mosque for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also tried to be heard in condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to accept it in their own country.
Different protests point to the division of visitors: some German Turks regard him as a hero and others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford — A Cyclist Death in Face with a Car
In London, a cyclist died in contact with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn streets, the busy Deptford road, the city in the southeast, at about 10.15 p.m. BVL.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived, but the man died on site.
The accident took place a few months after another two - wheeler killed on the street by a criminal who ran away, some 1.6 miles [1.6 km] from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that officials are trying to identify a person and inform his closest relatives.
The roads are closed and the bus routes are replaced, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officers were injured during the breakdown
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured during a serious breakdown in a special security prison for men.
The breakdown took place in HMP Long Lartin prison on Sunday at 09.30 at BVL, where it continues.
Special officials of Tornado were summoned for this breakdown, involving eight prisoners and taking place in a prison wing.
Officials shall be treated against minor facial injuries at the site.
A representative of the prison service said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were called.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that those responsible will be given to the police and perhaps spend more time than bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison manager was reported to be treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were called into prison to control a serious breakdown, during which some workers were charged with billiard balls.
Uragan Roza threatens Finix, Las Vegas, Solt Lake City with its sudden floods (it may be useful for dry areas)
It is not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week, when the storm Rose with its remaining energy will sink in the southwest of the desert and this will cause a risk of a sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced a surprise for the sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, spreading towards the south and east of Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including Finix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
It is expected that on a late Monday approaching the rain, Rosa will take it straight to the Finixa on Tuesday.
Finixe’s National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression no more than 322 miles [322 km] from Finix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm no more than 64 kilometres away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre of Uragans predict that in some parts of Arizona Mogolon Rim, the precipitation will reach 5 centimetres.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and in some places can fall up to 10 centimetres.
The rain of Rose can be a blessing for people who are not in a state of sudden flooding because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them may be useful because the south-west is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the US Drought Monitoring Centre, slightly more than 40% of Arizonas suffer from very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the storm Rose travels along the coast throughout the California Peninsula, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the storm category with a huge wind of 137 miles [137 km/h], is 619 miles [619 km] south of Euchen, Mexico, and moves northwards at a speed of 19 miles [19 km] per hour.
The storm is faced with cooler waters in the Pacific and is thus raging.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Flags falling in certain parts of Mexico may be serious and pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the northwest Sonora is expected to reach 8-15 centimetres, but perhaps even up to 25 centimetres of precipitation," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then on Tuesday morning, to the border of Arizona as a tropical depression, and then on Tuesday late night through Arizona as a south of Jutta.
"The main risk expected from the Roza or its residues is the very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, north-west Sonora and the US desert in the south-west," reported the National Urban Centre.
It is believed that these rains will result in life - threatening sudden floods, landslides in the deserts, and landslides in mountain areas.
Invading Midsamer Norton. Four persons suspected of attempting to kill
Three adolescents and a 20 - year - old man were apprehended by a suspected attempt to kill after a 16 - year - old boy was found in Somersete.
The teen was found injured in Midsamer Nortone in the "Excelsior" terrace area, around 04.00 p.m. by BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable state.
The police of Evon and Somerset reported that 17 years old, two 18 years old and 20 years old were arrested in the Radstock district at night.
The officials turned to all those who could have any material on their mobile phone about what happened.
The short one says that Kavanaugh "has suffered from the anger and anger of the Democratic Party".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the cruel and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trumpas in his speech in Vilinge, Western Virginia.
Trumpas said that during his nomination process, Kavanaugh "had experienced the anger, anger of the Democratic Party".
Kavanaugh witnessed on Thursday that the convention was firmly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexually attacked several decades ago while they were still teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his charges during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw on that day how great Kavanaugh was, how noble and courageous.
– Vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services," he said the crowds of Western Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly referred to Kavalogh's candidacy, while speaking about the importance of Republican electoral activity in the mid-elections.
“We have five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
I am not participating, although I am actually participating,” he said.
- That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
The short one said that the democrats wanted to "dispute and hinder".
Senior Assistant to GOP leaders CNN said that the first most important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to die.
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, and many were stunned by the enormous waves that hit the beach, when a severe earthquake and a tsunami struck the island of Sulaves.
Hundreds of people came to the Palu beach festival on Friday, when the waves of six feet [6 m] high began to crack down on the coast in the dark. Many of them killed and destroyed everything that had happened on the road.
After the tsunami, an earthquake of 7.5 points occurred.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the BNPA in Jakarta during the information report, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
“Cunamis did not break himself, he took away cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground,” said Nugroho and added that before he hit the coast, the tsunami was running at 800 km/h by the open sea.
He said that some people went into trees to escape the tsunami and survived it.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial pictures of the agency of natural disasters showed that a large number of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were tilted and destroyed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city was further crushed by repeated blows.
The series of earthquakes has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (FPPT) reported that on Friday, the energy released during an extremely severe earthquake exceeded 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb thrown down on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It has been reported that the tsunami could have been strengthened because of the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "a big one" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 people disappeared without knowledge.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the coast, located 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that communication networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received from Dongala.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross representative in the statement, adding that workers and volunteers go to areas affected by disasters.
It has been said that "this can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials said that the waves had arrived following a warning.
A man on the top floor of a building can be heard in the amateur material of social media, who keeps shouting about the approaching tsunami for people below the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, the power supply has been disrupted and communication networks around Palau have been cut off and it has been difficult for the authorities to coordinate aid.
The authorities reported that the army from Jakarta and other cities began to send commercial aircraft with emergency equipment, but the person evacuated still needs much food and other essential supplies.
The airport was again opened for aid purposes only and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widod planned to visit Palu in evacuation centres.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that when the World Vision personnel from Dongala went safely to Palu, where the workers were surrounded by tarpaulin tents built in the office yard, they were accompanied by destroyed images along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when the relief teams began to take difficult steps to provide assistance in the event of a disaster, some people complained that having a lot of experience in foreign assistance workers had been banned from travelling to Palau.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and foreign personnel can only help once the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a disaster at the level of the province, ” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
- When the government says, "Yes, it is a national disaster", we can call for international aid, but this status is not yet published."
After the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that the people they loved would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was forced into ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, a trainer of the Indonesian national paraglider sports team, had trained the two missing paragliders of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the stuck Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagius, were his students.
"Because I'm older in parasports, I wear my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon described in detail how, within a few hours, after declaring the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, this knowledge traveled through the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to Palu rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue crows.
"I think that means that no messages were received," he said.
When filling the ATM, the thieves at the entertainment center “Newport on the Levee” stole 26 750 US dollars
According to a press release from the Newport Police, on Friday morning thieves stole USD 26 750 from Brink's staff, who was filling the ATM in the entertainment center "Newport on the Levee".
“The car driver was empty ATM in an entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "became out of the back of the Brink's employee" and stole the money bag to be added.
According to the press release, the Witnesses observed a few suspects who fled from the scene, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information on their identity should contact the Newport police by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reperis has changed his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Having announced the changes in Twitter's account on Saturday, he wrote: "A person previously officially known as Kanye West".
For some time now, K. West has been called Ye and this name has named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He must replace singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled his performance for "emotional reasons," – said the creator of the show.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name – Mr West said earlier that this word has religious significance to him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you" in the Bible," said Mr. West earlier this year on the title of the album with the radio conductor Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It began with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
Album is more representative of what we are."
He is one of many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced the names of Love and Brotherly Love as the preferred one.
The former Wester colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
The Mexican politician Andrésas Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use troops against civilians.
The elected Mexican President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use the military against the civilian population when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students is approaching in the country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Taltelolco Square "nothing to use military forces to tame the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, when left-wing student movements began across Latin America, military forces on the square shot a peaceful demonstration and 300 people were killed.
Lopez Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidising students on a monthly basis and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
"Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field," says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments have been received since the various bodies in the US government published reports on artificial intelligence, even though there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US at all.
Meanwhile, China presented last year its plan to lead the way in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected to have another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee said in an interview this week with CNBC.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of Active Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order has been published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director-General of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most famous Chinese artificial intelligence companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the top American Othello player, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the China branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency's "Robotic Challenge", and asked when another will be available to help him find more intelligent people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to struggle hard to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders away – it’s companies,” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to step up efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences finances people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations spend money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from the industrial and academic community, while the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be set up.
This month, DARPA (the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency) announced an investment of around USD 2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF currently invests in artificial intelligence research in more than USD 100 million a year.
However, in the coming months nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would be an action that resolves a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means claims on Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents nationalists claim that changing the name would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The question of a referendum was put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO membership and EU acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change in name, including the Prime Minister, Zoran Zaeva, say that for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth paying a price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I come to vote for the country's future, young Macedonian people so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the results of the vote and will do so decisively.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be needed to replace the title.
The National Electoral Commission reported that it had not reported any violations by 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter of Skopje, the capital.
Parliamentary of Macedonia Zoran Zaeva, his wife Zorica and his son Duško vote in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country to open the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents that were built by a boycotting referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads and not to enter the service door,” said Kawadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and take part in Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaeva says that membership of NATO in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investments.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaeva said.
He said that the result "Yes" would be "ensuring our future".
According to the survey results published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
According to another survey carried out by the Macedonian television "Telma", 57 percent of respondents prepare to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to be successful, 50 per cent of voters must take part in it plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took over power last May.
See: the player of Manchester City, Sergio Aguero, overcomes the entire Brighton defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling over the Brighton defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, achieved a score of 2:0.
Aguer's 65 minutes beat the goal, it would seem incredibly easy.
Argentina's attacker ball in the middle of the square got at the beginning of the attack.
Before he broke into the open air, he ran between three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green T-shirt players.
He turned through one defender, before he overcame several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty court.
Then put the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English attacker took the ball back from the penalty court with one kick, Aguero, and this right leg hits the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming Brighton Gateer Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said Pepa Guardianola, Head of City.
- We said he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he's got a goal in that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues to break forward at these Premier League matches.
The goal is 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball during the attack while at the depth of the Brighton Square.
On the left side of the square between the two opponents, he gave the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane had several springs to drive the ball forward, while Sterling was on his way to a further whirlwind.
The Sky Blues attacker launched the ball into the gate just before he slipped out of the square.
On Tuesday, 12 am. 55 min., City meets with Hoffenheim in the Champions League matches in Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were no more valid reasons for the forssing.
The competitive Scherzer expects to overcome Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the opportunity to survive the playoffs; in the national league "West", they are one point ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies, the result of 5:2 on Friday evening, overcame the Nationals, at least provided a chance to get a preferential travel page, but still will have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Even though we play for nothing, at least we will be able to run to the ground knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and other teams will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can achieve this year.
Why not talk?"
The start-up composition of the team "Nationals" has not yet been announced, but in this case they are clearly inclined to release the Scherzer.
On Thursday, Scherzer, who will be 34th in the structure of this game, became a drop training and will take the position of the metician on his usual day of rest – Sunday.
Washington right-hand statistics for this season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 woven over 220 2/3 pelt.
Short speech in Western Virginia
As regards the role of Republican voters in the mid-term elections, the President implicitly refers to the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All we have achieved in November will be placed on the balance.
Five weeks have passed before our most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he continued: – You see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see how it happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don't care what they hurt, how they cross over to gain power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to resist and to hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "fucking, disgusting, low-fashioned and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate's Committee on Courts, commemorating the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which created huge innovations for audiences.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Yeah, uh, like.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labourists have lost the diversity of views.
They do not tolerate open-minded opinion
When Momentum activists voted for distrust in my local party, it is unlikely that they should have been surprised.
Finally, I am the most recent from Labour MEPs who have been told that I am undesirable, and that is what they have said.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she was determined to stand up against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed in criticism of me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbynu.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The report on Friday's meeting of the Nottingham East Labour stated that "we want a large number of members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings would be productive."
The vast majority of those eight years of being a local Labour Party Parliamenter, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly the same.
Sadly, today, the tone of many meetings is not so much and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if it has ever taken place.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and my colleagues, who I believed in before, began to expect me to turn at 180 degrees and hold opinions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and I don't care about anything – social networks are filled with insults that encourage my withdrawal, condemn the centre's policy and say that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who every day have to cope with the avalanche of sexist and racist insults.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbinas said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The belief is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with every procedure of 'reliance' or amendment of the electoral system, this party is getting less and less.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump, not to talk so loud, and then I will be "all things good".
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while I was still a student provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which in the sense of which my entire school class fell apart, I have been trying to win better public services for those who need them most – whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and disagreement with the current leaders.
For those who have encouraged this procedure every Friday, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have at the Momentum of Notingham for my constituents, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of revocation or political ambition will prevent me from acting in accordance with your beliefs and best interests of all.

"Ayr" – "Melrose" – 38:17 Insurable "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have distorted the final results a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this triumph moment in the impressive, promise-removable Tennent's Premiership day matches.
The team is now at the top of the table – the only one that has not been overcome.
After all, the victory was given to them with perfect defence and a good chance, so the coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We have raised all the tests during all the matches that have taken place so far, and we are still inexhaustible, so I am really happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr" turned out to be good, players took advantage of their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, which was completed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scott Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect figures and Baggot to stop the failure.
Climo increased the advantage of "Ayr" by a fine when, in the middle of the match itself, he gained points and completed his personal test with the help of "Ayr" to untie the result at 17:5.
However, Melrose started his second knee well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was completed in Baggot's work, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was stopped for a long time because Ruaridha Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken out of the floor to the carriers. After the extended match, Ayr continued to race forward when the McDowell test of Staffford was completed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received the yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the surplus of players, but Bruce Coline's attempt at the end of the severe pressure was not effective.
The home team player returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the fine line for the continuing Ayr battle place.
Climo has successfully completed its attempt, as he had already done since the start of the game, after Kyle's Rowe stopped David Armstrong's spring at the corner of the square and prevented Gregor Henry, the country's attacker, from organising the fifth home team's attempt to earn points.
“Still Game” star seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to switch to the accommodation and catering sector when it turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man in a popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes and plays with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of this release, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
Officially, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the sources of "Scottish Sun" mentioned that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "creating restaurant business".
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, expects the court to open its way to the ocean again
The seamen are patrolled at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, the flag of the ocean’s tongue is spreading.
The sea fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with the slogan: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It's our responsibility to get it back."
Throughout the land in Bolivia, there are still live memories of the access to the ocean that Chile had been donated in the 19th century bloody conflict due to the resources, – it is alive and yearning to encamp again in the Pacific.
The hopes that have been built up over the last decades have now been greatly strengthened, as, after five years of reflection, Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice judgment to be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to have positive results," said Roberto Calzadilla, the diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the announcement of the TTT decision on big screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint, with Chile being obliged to negotiate the Bolivian State's access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, Indian, waiting for the counterversa electoral fight for re-election, is also very interested in what will end on Monday.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific," he promised by the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will take a favourable decision in Bolivia — even if it were to do so — that there would be little change.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to untie Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard is hardly an indication that the case "was not difficult", – said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law of Chile.
And even if Bolivia was able to make some progress, the last four years could have knocked it back.
"This issue of sea access was raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that any remains of Chile’s good will have been destroyed by a vengeful Morales rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussion at some point, but after all it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the decision was taken unusually quickly.
"Monday Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end the 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never refuse access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to its promises agreed by the leaders of the competing countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when the Secretary of State, Michel Pompeo, seemed to have been planning to renew the entrenched nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu Singapore.
Ri says that "a utopian dream" is that the continuation of sanctions and the withdrawal by the US of the declaration of the end of the Korean war could ever bring North Korea down.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not first make convincing acts of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But a widespread sceptical opinion that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon an arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they quickly conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne have presented a wide range of eccentrically large headwear in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he has simply shocked the viewers of the Paris Fashion Week in his style.
These extremely unpractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer, and these designers introduced their eye-catching works on podium.
The distinctive work of Valentin was a huge body - colored hat decorated with a wide, feather - like edge surrounding the head of the manikin.
Other accessories of non-standard size were gemstoned watermelons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they were not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the right time for Helovin.
Many colorful masks were sewn in their lips and reminded Hannibal of Letter more than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a nare suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other reminded me of a melted ice nozzle.
And if you follow this huge trend of fashion – you won't ask.
The experts assume that these huge covers can enter the shops.
Big hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, the light hats with two foot edges were worn by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand, which has created extremely unpractical hats that conquered all social networks, has released another huge piece on the podium – a straw basket of the beach, almost the same size as the wearer.
The red brick frame basket, decorated with raffia pins and white leather handle, has become an exceptional accent of the Jacques collection "La Riviera SS19" in Paris Fashion Week.
Glory Stylist Luke Armitage, said FEMAIL: "I think that next summer, huge hats and beach bags will come to shops because the designer has so much influence, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard accessories."
John Edward: "The payment of language is an essential skill for the citizens of the world"
Scottish independent schools improved the record of academic achievements in 2018 and demonstrated once again the exceptional results of the exams, which have only been reinforced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30 000 pupils are enrolled across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career development and world citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the envisaged school scheme, we see that modern languages remain popular and are readily gathered in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you are able to talk to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you.
If you talk to him his own speech, you'll talk his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relations and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams we can say that languages are at the top of popularity and that independent schools have the best maintenance ratings.
In total, 68 percent of students in foreign languages received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarine Language Exam, 72 percent of German learners received the highest A rating, as well as 69 percent of French students received the highest A rating, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign language skills as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an optional issue, are now considered as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill their jobs were lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly binding so that young people are ready for their future careers.
As access to employment will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses when he learns a second language, he will in future be much better than others if he has these lifelong skills.
A person who learns several languages will be much more competitive by being able to communicate directly with people from abroad.
According to a survey carried out by youGov in 2013, involving more than 4 000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language sufficiently well to participate in the interview, while the French language was the only language spoken by two-digit percentage points, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language training is important for the children of the present.
Learning a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will improve the employability of children.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom, looking at the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a lot of languages from which you can choose from at an independent school with training staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a training environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undisputed that languages remain vital for the future of the country in today's global business environment, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and results to young people in Scotland.
That is something that needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will start the "Lakers" debut on Sunday in San Diego
There is little waiting for the fans to see how LeBron James will start the season in Los Angeles 'Lakers'.
Luke Walton, the "Lakers" coach, announced that James will play at the opening of the Sunday season with Denver's "Nuggets" in San Diego.
But a little bit of minutes to play, it's still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes", said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Michel Trudel in Twitter said that James is likely to play for a limited period of time.
Sometime earlier this week James was asked about plans in the "Lakers" team during six pre-seasonal games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need a pre-seasonal match to prepare for me," he said.
Short talk in Western Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts his campaign in Viling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of the five planned short languages in the following week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the adoption of the suspension procedure of the candidate of the Supreme Court of his choice, Trumpas aims to mobilise support in the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans were threatened by the loss of control at Congress in November.
An hour later this evening will be held in the Short Language West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Short speech in Vilinge, Western Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. East Time evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Short Language in Western Virginia on the Internet in YouTube below.
The short one will probably touch this week's question of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, because it has soared a lot of tension over suspicions of improper sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted in favour of suspending the nomination until the week before the FBI conducts its investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump campaign state that the goal of these five meetings next week, as announced by Reuters, is to "energe volunteers and supporters, in an effort by Republicans to defend and expand the majority available to the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congres control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, because the very hot campaign season begins," said a representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to reveal his name.
"This evening's language planned at the Vilnius Wesbanco Arena should attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsberg," says the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, a third visit will take place in West Virginia, a state where more than 40 percentage points have been won in 2016.
A short try to help the West Virginia candidate for the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to surveys is in the lowlands of ratings.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the ratings," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is wary and looks forward to getting into the Sunday units tournament
After three personal rounds on Saturday afternoon, four can be exactly what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a course of success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in events like this.
So on whose side is success now?
"They first took six points, and now four, so I guess we can count it as a little success," said Jordan Spiethe, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is leading, it has a four-point balance, and it is waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, according to Spietho, is scattered, and they have no shortage of it, not to mention the form of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them gathered three points out of four.
It was invincible from the beginning to the end and impeccablely first.
As the round continued, these wild victories of victory became increasingly famous. Thomas gained two points out of two possible to complete the fourth match.
His blow, which had won them in this match at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar slogans that said that the American team was not getting through.
"Just focus and take care of your matches," said Spiethes.
Now each of these players has to play separately.
By the successful end – 18 wells.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwoods, the history of the Ryder Cup is indisputable.
It is strange, but the charming couple of Europe have gathered four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not need any extra blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of frantic viewers only confirm that they will be those players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinary, who, after the last rising sunshine, have the chance to bring a European victory.
It would be good for both wells to succeed at the same time.
It is too early to talk about Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of four balls, when he was paired with Alex Norren.
The extra blow and the two double extra blows in the first nine wells series pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into the trouble they were not able to get out of.
However, no one will get out of the trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and quads of match are so interesting to observe because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and do not give, and the fact that the strategy can instantly change.
Europe was better played as a team, so with determination came to the final, but this fourth stage also showed that the U.S. team had the spine of the fighter, some of whom, especially in the states, had doubts.
On the last Ryder Cup Day, Europe is leading 10:6
Europe will meet at the final Ryder Cup on the final day of the competition with a weighty weight, after the fourth round of Saturday, first before the United States result in 10:6.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary duo continued to heat the atmosphere, winning two victories against the hard fighter Tiger Woods and taking the lead in Le Golf National by four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy that had been lost in Hazeltin two years ago, prevailed in four in the morning match against the failed American side and the stage ended at 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in fours when won two match but failed to overcome points in excess
Jim Furyk's half needs eight points from the 12 units of Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who succeeded in winning four points in a row, when Molliwood and Molinari duplicated after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four match in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they flawlessly crushed trust in the lost Woods and the American newer Bryson Dechambeau with an even better result, 5:4.
Woods, otherwise not so far over the two Saturday matches, showed a high level of professionalism in some moments, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his match fours, of them seven in a row.
Justin Rose's four o'clock in the morning and returned to play with partner Henry Stanson in four; they scored 2:1 and overcame 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brook Koepk, who took the first and third place in world ratings.
Despite the pleasant, gentle windy day in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not go as far as butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas raised the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In the match of the four balls, they won an effortless victory in the score of 2:1 against the Spanish John Rahma and Ian Poulter, and in the quartet mache, overcame Poulter and Rory McIlroy’s score of 4:3, without killing the ball into the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team managed to win a four-point shift to separate match, even though Furyk would have enough smooth to keep the trophy.
Even though two days were in second place, it seems that success on Sunday turned out to be a failure.
North Korea says that it will in no way be stolen unilaterally without being able to trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen their distrust with the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
The General Assembly of Ri Yong Ho World Organisation has said that North Korea has taken “a significant measure of good will” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test base and committing itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not have a similar response from the US," he regretted.
"With no confidence in the US, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first unilaterally armed."
Until Ri repeated North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which the North Koreans would be rewarded in its steps of action, his statement was distinguished by the fact that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first US President-Nordic leader meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to working on the "Dearmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the 1950-1953, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and increases pressure on sanctions to reach its goal by forceful methods, even by refusing the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that sanctions can cause us to fall behind is the same thing as people who don’t care about pursuing utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Trump meeting, which was highlighted by the US leader in the United Nations a little earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months: "If another country had been South Korea on this issue of nuclear disarmament rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such acligativity."
However, the tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “a missile gentleman”, who was preparing a suicide mission, it was absolutely inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles to the US.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, was commended for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea meets the requirements of nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this, and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Michel Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the security Council's sanctions must be pursued with determination without any concessions until full final evidence-based nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the back of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again the next month to pave the way for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he left Pyongyang saying that all the progress had been made just to declare in a few hours North Korea that he had made "gangsterical demands".
North Korea promised this month to dismantle the missile base and the nuclear facility if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim claimed that those "appropriate measures" he sought are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the tendency to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more in order to fight the growing match culture in studios, by using caffeine and by sleeping nights
One academician found that students at the best university in the world often have no basic knowledge about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor at the Harvard Medical School of Sleep Medicine and Brigg City, a female hospital specialist, has developed a course that he says is the first one in the United States of America.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited after a talk about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why is it that I only be told about this now, in the last year of my studies?"
She said that nobody had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he said, "The Telegraph."
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Department of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to offer this course at a time when it turned out that the students had very low sleep per week.
The hourly rate shall include a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photograph of the apartment room, where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects the results of sports and how important the walking sleep routine is.
In the following section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map of the student town with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We take the view that this will not change student behaviour at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke", explained Professor Czeisler.
The proud culture of sleep overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep shortages.
"To ensure that enough and high quality sleeps out, there should be a student secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, "even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep transforms the brain into a fasting regime, so students constantly feel hungry."
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californiaman studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop a course when he attended one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to follow this course before starting to visit this competitive body.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to set up an alarm when it's time to go to sleep, just as rising, and to avoid the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LED lighting, because they can beat your circus rhythm from balance, so it can be difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": The Men's Gate of Men has upset the men of Gerrard
Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone managed to overcome the weakened result of Steven Gerrard 1:0.
Ibrox was hoping to earn his first victory on the trip after the triumph of February 4:1 St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team defeated Gerrard during the 18 match at the head of the team and now the latter team is eight points behind away from the far-flying premiere leaders Hearts.
Menga beat up seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, Rangers did not see an opportunity to equalize the result.
Rangers has now fallen to the sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third and only one goal is behind Hibernian.
And Rangers' concerns don't stop because it's probably the butter from the triples that hit the head of the side judge Calum Spence and wounded him.
Gerrard made four amendments that allowed Ayr to be crossed and led him to the Betfred Cup's semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt had confidence in the same monk who took the 'Hearts' point last week and would have liked him how his well-thought combinations shook opponents at every step.
Rangers was dominant in controlling the ball, but having "Livingston" it did more.
They could kill him for the second minute, when Menga gave the ball to Scott Pittman, who was at the gates of Allan McGregor, with a close impact, but safely destroyed his chance by directing the ball away from the gate.
After the long-haunted Keaghan Jacobs' free blow ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner defender Alan Lithgow called by the wayward.
Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was only a game of hope and not a game of faith.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfred Morelos felt that he deserved a fine when faced with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson went to Colombia's complaints with his hand.
Rangers was only able to hit twice in the first knee, but the former Ibrox goalman Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulbaly's head of impact or by the gentle selling of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Liv's 34th-minute goal may not have been in line with the course of the game, no one will argue that they deserve it for their efforts.
Rangers once again failed to overcome the viscosity of Jacobs' defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his self - control and handed Menga over for easy completion.
During the break Gerrard took action to replace Coulbaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately yielded fruit when the country played Morelos in safety, but the impressively played Kelly, who ran, took the blow.
Livingston has involved the guests in the game that he liked – with far-reaching transfers of the Litgow and Halkett ball.
The Holto team at the end was able to increase its balance, but McGregor defended himself from Jacobs' shock after Litthgows' laying from the corner.
After switching to the square, the Rangers player Glenn Middleton appealed once more at the end of the match for the penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it's 136 years ago and MORE... That day, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity.
Since then, this device has become a hit of the world of science, and later a hit of popular culture, when in 1950, cowboys, not particularly like the cowboys Royñ Rogers and Daleñ Evans, played in the "Bells of Coronado" film:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear atoms work and touch them with radioactive substances."
Evans: "Hey, now it really shoots!"
Hans Gaiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But after his name, invention survives.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system how to see bad cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill bad cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves recovering immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then cells can "see" proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and are injected back
The trial vaccine has produced promising results in a wide range of cancer patients.
One woman who has received this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, and then the cells can see proteins typical of HER2-type cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda (Meriland) said: "The results we obtained suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes several types of cancer growth, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and trained to go into cancer cells, was successfully applied to the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West launched a short tyrade, wearing a MAGA hat, after his show at the SNL show.
The good thing didn't stop
After an uncooled performance at the “Saturday Night Live” studio, the audience was ashamed of the shoutings of Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
Having performed the third song "Ghost Town" that night, wearing a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the democrats and expressed his support for Trumpas.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, "How can you like Trump, for he's a racist?"
Well, if racism was a problem for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show started with a comic scene where Matt Damon laughed at the Brettt Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's court committee on the accusations of improper sexual conduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, Chris Rock put filmed material with Westo's replicas into social networks.
I don't know if Rock's been trying to fuck West out of this record.
West also complained to the audience that there were troubles in the backstages because of his head covering.
“They mocked at me in the backstages.
He told me not to go there with such a hat.
They're kidding me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner."
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is?
Start loving."
His speeches at least two times caused disapproval at the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, as "Warriety" says. One person said to the media: "The entire studio was a deadly silence."
West was invited to change singer Ariana Grande quickly because her former boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance, through which he performed the song I Love it, wearing the Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, the leader of TPUSA, who in Twitter's account published an entry: "For one of the bravest spirits of man: I FOR WITNESSES".
But Karen Hunter, the head of the chat show, announced in the Twitter account that West was just "been yourself and it's extremely wonderful".
“But I choose not to be a man (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his “art”) whose beliefs are poisonous ideology that harm my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in the Twitter account that the name had changed and that it is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator who changed his name, but went on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dog, was originally called Snoop Lyon; the legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

The prosecutions will be reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
Star of "Store Wars" Next Harington criticises a distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington is known as a sword-exhibiting character John Snau HBO in a fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages of Port Wars.
But at the age of 31, the actor criticises the stereotyping of the macho hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they were supposed to be tough to be respected.
Talking about the Sunday Times Culture, the next one said that he thought "something is wrong" and raised the question of how to tackle the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another who recently married a 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie, a star of the Port Wars, admitted that this topic "has a strong impact on him".
“I feel that I am now deeply touched by this topic. Where did we make a mistake in building masculinity?” he asked.
"What do we teach to growing men that we are facing such problems?"
Another believes that this distorted wave of masculinity could, in part, be responsible for television because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, but what is taught?
What does this teach on television or on the street that young people believe that they need to have such a type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important questions of our time – how do we change it?
It's obvious that we made a mistake with young men somewhere."
He also confirmed by an interview that he would not participate in any pre-historic or continuation of "Store Wars" when next summer the series will end, and said that "he already had enough battle fields and horses."
Since November, the next film will take place in the modern version of "True West" of Sam Shepard, a film about the extortion of film directors and their brother.
The actor recently unveiled the best thing that happened to him in the creation of the Port Wars, - there he met his wife Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
In the fantastic series Rose, which won the Emmy Award, she played Igritė, another character John Snow's love object.
The couple were married in June 2018 in Leslie family owned in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 % in new cases
China reports that the number of citizens with HIV/AIDS infection increased by 14%.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, around 40 000 new cases were reported alone.
Most of the newly infected people were sexually transmitted, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living with HIV fell to almost zero, as the Chinese health authorities pointed out at a conference in the province of Junano.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 over time.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised as early as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up leading women.
Most cases of infection with this disease are due to inappropriate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have leaked data from the Republican senator, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the suspicion that one of its employees announced personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of legislators Wikipedia.
The democracy in Los Angeles believed that the accusations were made by ultra right-wing experts and websites.
"Mel, lies and once again a gullible lie," said Waters in their Twitter account.
The information disclosed included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time when allegations of mistreatment by the Senate to the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh were examined.
The leaked information appeared a little later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
"On the Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, it was reported that the IP address at which the source of these records related to the Waters Office was determined and the information of the Waters staff member was disclosed to the Capitol."
"These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies", said Waters.
‘My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions, shall under no circumstances be liable for the loss of this information.
These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies."
The Waters statement soon received criticism on the Internet, including from the press representative of the former White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds bad," wrote Fleischer.
“It says that she has no sufficient self-control to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of things that he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
It should be calm and humble."
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare Waters' reaction with the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at Thursday's meeting.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who is taking part in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts in the Twitter account.
"It's true, if it's not a lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its Bureau had informed the institutions and enforcement bodies concerned of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the organisers are clarified, that she continues to be responsible for all her actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
Review of the comedy “Jonis Inglišas is again smiling” – exhaled spy show with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become a reference to Brexit in any British film. The same seems to be true of the revitalisation of the action spy comedy "Jonis Inglišas" – "Jonis Inglišas" was started in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to the screens with the comedy "The Resurrection of John Ingliša".
Is this sarcastic car going to be a new opportunity for national exports about how we're obviously messed up?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglish has the second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with his wide eyes and with his rubber face. After all, the name clearly shows that this comedy work is aimed at non-English-speaking cinematographer regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, while having claims for luxury, acquired some of the qualities of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit like Mr. Biny's features and a little bit like that guy, was the hint about which the drama "Fire Transportations" was used during the 2012 opening ceremony for the London Olympic Games.
It is also a little based on the character of the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the current forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
This latest film by Johnny Inglis contains some beautiful moments.
I liked when Johnny Inglish approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
The comedy talent of Atkinson is obvious, but humor seems breathful and strangely surplus, especially when the serious brands of films, such as 007 and “Mission Is Not Possible”, boldly include the elements of comedy.
Humor is more designed for children than for adults, and the adventures that I don't believe in John Inglish seem as ingenious and peaceful as Atkinson's quiet jokes in the play of Mr. Bye.
The most common topic at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has successfully entered Britain's highly secret spy Internet network and revealed the identities of all British spy in this field, which leads to the indignation of the agent – the very insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the cup of the prime minister, the pumpastic and corner-warranted character, which is already suffering from the trebbling political unpopularity: Emma Thompson from Teresa May is squeezing everything you can, but there is little good material in the scenario.
Wise advisors inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people between retired people.
This means addressing Johnny Inglis, who is currently a school director in some kind of chic institution, but who provides illegal lessons to work as a secret agent. There were some good jokes here when Inglis offered the School of Rock academies.
The Ingliish is sent back to Whitehol to discuss the state of emergency and agrees with his longtime Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough's already married man, associated with the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-ranking girl, seems to be underutilised.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to confuse all things in Her Majesty's secret service, are taking action and meeting with Olga Kurylenko's role in the fatal beauty Ofelija Buletova.
The Prime Minister is in danger of turning his head into a charismatic billionaire, saying that he can solve the problem of British computers, that is, the evil man Jason Volta, who is being played by Jake Lacy.
Inglis and Bough start their odyssey: when dressed up as waiters, they cause fire in the French restaurant, cause chaos on the luxurious Volta yacht, and Inglis begins a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to get acquainted with Volta's home interior.
All the stocade were clear to hold on to this last series, but whatever it was pleasant or wild, all of this reminds us of children’s television.
It's pretty average.
As with other films by Johnny Inglis, I couldn't get rid of the idea: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would certainly be worthy of his talent?
Labour denies the British plan for working four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company leaders to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (DI) revolution by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy the three - day weekend and bring the same amount of pay together.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country's development towards its employees.
The transition to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
One of the sources of the High Level Labour Party "The Sunday Times" said: "The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four working days week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised four working days a week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of Labour Party said: "The week of four working days is not party policy and it is not considered in the party."
A representative of the shadow government, John McDonnellis, took the opportunity last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party Conference.
Mr McDonnellis said that he was determined to regain power from "fightless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utility companies.
Such plans by the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share because, in view of the harm caused, the Labour Government can deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees on the board of the company and to create equity funds, so that 10% of the private sector’s capital would be transferred to employees and would be able to receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the "60 Minutes" question as to whether the FBI investigation concerning Mr Kavanaugho can change their opinion
In the course of an investigation by the FBI into the accusations brought against Judge Brett Kavanaughu, the final vote was postponed for at least one week to the Supreme Court, so the question arises as to whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Inquiry could affect the opinion of any Republican senators in such a way that they would not be assisted by this judge.
Scott Pelley, correspondent of the 60 Minute interview on Sunday, asks senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it may happen that the FBI will find out something that will change their opinion.
It seems that Senator Kennedy is taking a more free approach than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replies Mr Kennedy.
“As I said in my meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaughu.
When that happened when these charges appeared, I called him and asked him, "Did you do that?"
He answered decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
Thus, Mr Graham's opinion seems to be unchanged from anyone.
"I decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, we should make really shocking accusations," he says.
"For Dr. Ford I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brittas strongly denies this," added Mr. Graham, bearing in mind Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one that it designates can confirm this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think there will be anything new."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event with impressive numbers of stars and an equally impressive goal to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawnas Mendes, but will also spread the real goal of the event – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Action Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it actively.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, calling by phone, or in any other meaningful way helping to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, does the world’s citizens succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remain until the deadline is set.
Is the intention to reward people with a free concert really going to convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe it's just another example of so-called 'clicky', 'false activism' – people believe that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing a record on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters, which promote a wide range of objectives.
They say that under pressure, world leaders have published USD 37 billion in commitments and policies that involve the replacement of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and statements triggered by the group’s actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
According to the Group, the guaranteed funds have already directly affected almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and operators in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children grow up and discover all their opportunities". With more than 4 700 messages from the world's citizens Twitter, it promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help resolve the problem of malnutrition.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, supporters, governments and such as you, the citizens of the World, we can make social injustice such as the lack of nutrition a past,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, in the concert in London in April 2018.
This group also pointed out that following 5 000 requests to improve the diet of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the diet power project to reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on your website, which asks, "Why do you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
World citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult way – sometimes we will get up and fail.
However, like the great human rights movements and against apartheid, we will win, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers who are taking part in this year's event in New York. Deborr-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will lead the event.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use fleet blockades to prevent Russian energy exports
“When necessary, Washington can use the fleet to hamper Russia’s energy access markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the U.S. Interior, according to “Washington Examiner”.
Mr Zinke states that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zinke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this through the fleet, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, can be blocked, that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to those who took part in the event, which was organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit group known as the U.S. 'voice of energy consumers'.
He then compared the Washington methods with those applied to matters concerning Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially the same.
“Iran-Russia’s economic alternative is to find a larger or smaller counterweight to replace fuel”, he also said, and he also called Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared by the Trump administration as part of its mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the Trump Administration officials, including the U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, made Berlin a prisoner in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
According to Kreml, the hard reason for Washington's opposition to this project is only economic, it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose their suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandras Novakas after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rickas Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has received a hostile reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I really do not agree with third-country interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will seriously consider raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential elections
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he was serious about the question of presidential candidates after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the Holjoko Hall, Massachusettse E. Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"The year to go to Washington for women to manage our failed government, they must go to the highest position," she said.
"After 6 November I will be serious about whether or not to take part in the presidential election."
At the meeting at the city hall, Mr Warren went on to say to President Donald Trump that he is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very afraid of the way Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Kavanaugh.
In Twitter on Friday's message, Mr Warren says that "the FBI investigation must be carried out before the vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that most of the voters in the state of E. Warren themselves believe that they should not stand for President in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Safolk and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the expected Massachusetts voters say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Devalas Patrick received more support – 38 percent supports a possible candidate and 48 percent opposes it.
Others were discussed by former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, who had been nominated for their possible nomination in 2020.
Mr Biden says that he has made a formal decision in January, according to the report of the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin, at his short meeting, speaks of the post-traumatic disorder of Tracko Palino
On September 26 - year - old Track Palin spent his year in Iraq.
On Monday night, an incident of domestic violence, he was arrested and charges were brought against him.
"I see what my son is going through, what he is facing when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who feel the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder, and a certain injury of our soldiers, with whom they are coming back," she said to those who met at the Donald Trumps meeting in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Ms. Palin called his arrest a avoidable truth. She said that the son and other veterans of the war "return when they are a little changed, they return to a harder heart, they return to doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, indictment of domestic violence and of the attack against women, as well as indictment of domestic violence in the presence of a weapon and in the presence of a dull, as reported by Dan Bennett, a press representative of the Vasila Police Department.
18 states and Colombia support resistance to the new policy on asylum seekers
Eighteen states and Colombia support the legal challenge of the new US policy refusing to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 states and representatives of this region submitted comments from amicus curiae (the judge) in support of the policy challenge of asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The applicant’s full name in proceedings before Grace v Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties has initiated against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" was violent against her, but on July 20, US officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
Greece’s supporting state lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the US receives a large number of asylum applications as states suffering from the problems of domestic violence and domestic violence of permanent gangs.
The new US asylum policy has repealed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants who have been subjected to domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday in the report, Karl Rininim, General Prosecutor of Colombia, indicated that the new policy "is not in compliance with the laws of state, federal and international law in force for decades".
"Federation laws require that decisions on applications for asylum be taken on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition is violated", says amicus curiae.
In this note, lawyers also state that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering a country are detrimental to the US economy, and that immigrants are more likely to be engaged in business and "to provide the necessary labour services".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration to stop providing asylum to those who are fleeing from domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
"Shelter shall be granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Mr Sessions in a policy report on June 11.
Asylum has never been aimed at solving all the problems, not all the serious problems, that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Two times the number of victims in Palu, desperately searching for the rest
The situation of the remaining living is deteriorating constantly.
"Volunteering is very high", says Risa Kusuma, 35-year-olds.
“The fast one continues to transport more and more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water."
It has been observed that the population is returning to the destroyed home, collecting excess water items, and trying to save whatever you can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5 - point earthquake hospitals are stuffy.
Some injured people, like Dwi Harry, have experienced back and shoulder fractures and have been placed outside the Palu Army Hospital – the patient is being treated outside for continuing severe repeated shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears when he tells us how he felt a severe earthquake in the hotel’s fifth - floor room, where his wife and daughter were staying.
“There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I was caught up in the ruins of the wall," said D. Harry "Associated Press" and added that he came to the city to participate in the wedding.
“ I heard a cry for help from my wife, ” he said.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador charged China with intimidation of propaganda advertising
A week later, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the US daily, commending the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the premium paid by China Daily to the most expensive newspaper in Iowa, Des Moines Register, and accused China of influencing the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies this charge.
“D. Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US elections marks a new stage in the growing Washington campaign aimed at exerting pressure on China”, said U.S. officials to the Reuters Agency.
Although it is common practice for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an increasing trade war and both parties are fighting tariffs for imports of each other.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese counter-tariffs were directed to exporters of Iowa and similar countries that supported the Short Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had undermined American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the daily newspaper Des Moines Register, T. Branstad said that China "is more taunting about printing propaganda in our free press."
“In promoting propaganda, the Chinese authorities have exercised their respected freedom of speech and the press in America and ordered a paid-out advertisement “Des Moines Register,” wrote T.Branstad.
"However, in the local kiosk of Beijing you will not find any opposing voices and you will not create a true picture of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the worrying economic trajectory of China, because the press is under the solid arm of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers got away with the proposal to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: in the run-up to the mid-term elections, B. Kavanaugh fiasco is deterred by the republican voters
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate for the Supreme Court Bretta Kavanaugh, who has even been accused of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would have a negative response during the forthcoming mid-elections, especially of women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans have already formally claimed that they want to have a vote.
Such things cannot be taken away later," said Grant Reheer, professor at the Maxwell School of Sirakuses University, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
According to Rehearer, doubting whether the last minute of the senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) calls for the launch of an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure the wrong voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the chief adviser and national representative of the MoveOn group of progressive views, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning protestors read: "The November is coming!" during the demonstration in the foe of the Senate, when the Republicans controlling the Committee on Courts decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the statements of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the zip reported "Mic".
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will touch the edges,” said Stu Rotheenberg, political analyst for the site.
- People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen its position, especially among undecided women voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave evidence, when she made detailed accusations of sexual harassment against a candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that if the Republicans approve the candidature, this could lead to outrage.
"This caused great confusion to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to "NBC News".
“Not only was the committee or final vote discussed, not only whether Kavanaugh would be appointed as a judge, but also how the Republicans managed this situation and how Ch. B. Ford was treated,” Guyus Cecilas, the director of the group assisting democrats in the elections, said to the news channel.
It does seem, however, that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the statements of Kavanaugh and Ford, although they are receiving some more support.
A new survey by "YouGov" shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in the testimonies of Ch. B. Ford, while 35 percent claim completely or probably believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Mr Kavanaugh really or probably lied by giving evidence, and only 30 percent thought the same about Mr Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ch. B. Ford and the testimony of at least one other accused person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Mr Ford sworn to give evidence to the Senate Courts Committee last week, claiming that when he was indifferent, Mr Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
According to Mr. Ramirez, the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party where they visited the 9th tenth of the University of Yale.
The Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
The inventor of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is developing a new startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor Inrupt is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee open source platform “Solid”.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and which information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee laughed that Inrupt's goal is to control the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about startup.
- It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology-based app allows people to create a personal online data store – POD.
It may include lists, works lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Lock and Spotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The personal data online shop is unique in that only the user decides who can access and access the information.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools provided by Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about changes that would turn up all business models overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In the Medium report published on Saturday, Berners-Lee states that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help to protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Web Consortium of the Web, which was founded at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel great optimism about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Honored Bernard Vann – First World War Victory Cross-Beneficiary
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only clergyman of the Church of England was honored in his home city and was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Colonel Lieutenant Pastor Bernard Vann earned his award on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Belgrade and Lucy.
Unfortunately, in four days' time, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he did not know that he was awarded the highest-level British army award.
At the time, two grandsons unveiled the memory stone in the county of Norstamptonshire.
One of the grandsons Michael Vann said that the fact that the stone was opened just 100 years after the award was awarded to Grandpa is “a wonderfully symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 the lieutenant of Colonel led his battalion through the St. Kenten canal "difficulty in a very thick mist, with the fire of the canisters and automatics. "
Later he hurried to the firing line and led the line "especially galantically" and then, alone, attacked the basement and killed three combatants.
Colonel Lt. B. Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were "some who would never be equal to himself, but at the same time a very inspiring thing of humility."
After the parade led by the Brentwood Emperor Youth Orchestra, Michel and his brother, Dr. James Vann, helped the crown.
Micheal Vann said that he had a great honour to participate in the parade, and added: "The courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give."
MMA's fans didn't go to sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but they had to meet "Kiwante Pepa."
Imagine: You don’t go to sleep all night to see the bottled Bellator 206, but finally you don’t get a look at the main view.
There were 13 fights in San Choze, six of which were on the main card and were broadcast live in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
Six o'clock in the morning, when Gedgard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were going to fight, the UK audience was surprised by the video "Peppa" that stopped broadcasting.
Some viewers were not impressed, to put it mildly, because it was precisely this fight that they did not go to sleep until the morning.
On TV, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast by a children's cartoon "some kind of diseased joke."
“In accordance with the rules laid down by the government, at 6 a.m. such content was not suitable, so the children’s program had to be activated,” said Dave Schwartz, Chief Vice-President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator.
"Yes, "Shit Peep."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust timetables to viewers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," said Cocker.
“But at that time there is 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve this by Sunday in our time – Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, a number of messages have been exchanged since the broadcast changed, and not all have been friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a question of power.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as usual we do. We wanted to give the fans more but simply failed.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt incomplete due to his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper to the water Tom Daley says he grew up feeling weaker than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him a motivation to succeed.
24 The sportsman claimed that he was only at primary school who realized that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time in the radio 4 programme by Lauren Laverne he said that he had started to speak publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that, when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a permanent head of this long - term program, has been leaving for several months because of illness.
In the first show conducted by L. Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine that they are travelling to an unresidential island, Mr. Daley said that he felt less growing than everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said, "Like today, this feeling of weakness and otherwise was an incentive that gave me the strength to succeed."
He claimed that he wanted to prove that he was worthy of this, in order not to be disappointed by others when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and has taken advantage of this year’s United Nations Alliance Games to encourage more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he had started to talk about it publicly, because he believed that he was lucky that he could live a life without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
Three times the world champion claimed to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was unexpected.
Mr Daley married last year to Oscar's 20-year-old laureate, but he says that age difference never caused a problem.
According to T. Delay, when he was so young in his first Olympics, he was only 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer, it is difficult to meet someone of the same age, but he had the same heights and lowlands.
In June, when the couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, the perspective of Daley changed completely, according to him.
“If you had listened to me last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me is to win the gold medal, ” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as Grandpa Roberto, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old when brain cancer was diagnosed.
Anto T. Daley, father, did not want to accept death, so one of his final questions was whether tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch while sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him it wouldn’t last so long that I could sit in the first row,” said Daley.
- I held my arm when he stopped breathing, and then I finally admitted that he was not inviolable," said Mr Daley.
A year later, the athletes competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that I dreamed of it all my life – to dance in the water by watching local viewers at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling," he said.
It has also inspired the selection of the first song by wires – Heather Small’s work “Proud”, which has responded to his feelings of preparing for the Olympics and is still pleasantly raging the skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. in British summer time through BBC Radio 4.
Ph. Mickelson, who lost his form, spent the Ryder Cup on the bench on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will reach the record on Sunday, as he will participate in the Ryder Cup for 47 time, but to prevent this from becoming a successful anniversary, he will need to improve his shape significantly.
Mr Mickelson, who has already been playing for the 12th time in the two-year event, has been stationed by Captain Jimas Furykas on the bench on Saturday's 4th competition.
Instead of being in the center of action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day in the support team, and the rest of the team improved their technique in the field to correct the problems that hinder it.
Even in the highland of his career, 48 athletes are not an ideal player in the "Le Gold National" squares, which have a long stretch of rough grass that is extremely unfavourable for precise hits.
In addition, as if the square itself were not enough frightening, in the ninth match, which will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will play against Francesco Molinari, an extremely precise British Open Tournament, who, along with a newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If four points behind Americans succeed in starting the coming 12 units of match, Mr. Mickelson's match can become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player, but probably he could not speak differently.
“He understood the role that he had today, plucked me through his back, and with his arm he said that he was ready to play even tomorrow,” Furykas said.
- He doesn't lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes and has given these teams a great deal both in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't imagine he's gonna play two matches.
I've imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph.Mickelson will improve the record of Nick Faldo and become the most played sportsman of Ryder Cup matches.
It is possible that this will mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which is not equal to his personal record heights.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven evens, but Furykas says that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s a funny, sarcastic, obscene, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think younger players were also happy to compete with him this week, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great victory can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European team captain, knows from experience that a great victory towards the latest Ryder Cup matches can easily grow into a hard fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in Mach Valderama in 1997, where a team of opponents led by Captain Sev Ballesteros had a five-point balance against the Americans, but the finish line was only crossed with the very first result 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a great deal of weight in Valderam; we had a great deal of weight in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valdemar, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorne (in a photo) who watched the result of the 2018 edition at 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on the Le Golf National Square.
So history will show me and all the team members that it's not over.
I'll need every strength tomorrow.
Go do the right thing.
Until there are no points on the board, the game is not complete.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we have to pursue it in a consistent way.
I always said, I rely on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly who's on the other side – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complex square, T. Bjorne added: “In any way, I would not want to run by myself.
Morning will be a matter of a different kind of hair.
Tomorrow the most important thing will be an individual game – it's quite different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're in the square alone, your ability to play golf is tested.
This idea needs to be introduced to players – everything will have to be pushed out of you tomorrow.
Now we're gonna have to split up with our partner, and he's gonna have to squeeze everything out of himself too."
Unlike Mr Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear on an individual basis rather than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself suffered both sides of the surprises of the last day because he was in Brooklyn in a winning team before Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every fucking word,” he replied, asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but try to start quickly – the way you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle match becomes very tense.
Accordingly, we formed our team and released the players in a way that we know... try to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to lead a counter-fight with Rory McIlroy's highest-level match, and Paul Casey, Justinas Rose, Jonas Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are among the leading Europeans.
"I chose these guys in exactly this order, because I think they will successfully overcome the whole game," told T. Bjorn about their choice of units for the match.
New German military ship delivered delayed again
The latest fregata of the German Navy was to start work as early as 2014 and replace military ships of the Cold War, but according to the local press, they will not be seen at least next year due to the increasing systems and the huge increase in prices.
According to a representative of the army quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz – the main ship of the new Fregates of Baden-Württemberg class – is now postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was darkened by the problems that had begun to plague the ship that had already been presented.
Four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class, commissioned by the Navy as early as 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen class fregates.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful charge, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and certain technologies of secrecy, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which could allow the latest fregats to travel far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, military vessels that are supposed to allow Germany to channel military power to the overseas territories will become obsolete before they are put into service, due to the continuing delays in the most advanced technologies.
The unsuccessful F125 fregata entered its headlines last year, when the German Navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a navy returns a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
The reasons for the return are known to be limited, but the German press mentions some of the essential defects in the software and technical equipment that would have caused the ship to be useless in a military mission.
The software weaknesses are particularly important, as the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is half of the previous Bremen class frequencies.
It has also proven to be too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project is also gradually becoming a problem alongside the plowing technical equipment, including crew training.
It is said that it has risen from an initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to a staggering amount of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion).
The most recent problems with the fregata have become very significant following recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is being undermined.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the navy was actually "a shortage of suitable ships".
The officer said that the problems had developed over time, because old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study in a Scottish highland manor aims to reveal how bats use the landscape for hunting food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future environmental performance.
Scientists of National Trust for Scotland will watch bats, sopranos, brown earmowers and water-moused Wester Ross Inverevo gardens in their research.
Special recording devices will be set up in certain areas of the territory to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile investigations by hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of bat signals and one or the other type of activity.
Then a map and report will be created of the residential areas, which will help to form a detailed image of behaviour throughout the landscape.
"National Trust for Scotland" (NTS) Nature Protection Adviser Rob Deware hopes that the results will reveal which residential areas are most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help to identify the benefits of maintenance work on residential areas, such as the development of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas in order to be suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has been declining.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works that have an impact on hatcheries and destroy residential areas.
Windmills and lightnings are also at risk, like the Muscoots, some chemicals used to treat building materials, as well as domestic cats that are hunting.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, it is more helpful to catch a prey during night hunt by ears than by eyes.
In the case of bats, the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path shall be precisely determined by means of an imaginary echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for the use of bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, hatcheries inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even created the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland in the Threave Manor in Damfries and Galway, where it lives in eight of the ten types of bats in Scotland.
The manager of the manor David Thompson says that the area of the manor is ideal for them.
“The Threave Manor has a great place for bats,” he said.
- We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
However, we do not know much about bats yet, so work here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to be able to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking that bats are not present before the start of the site surveillance work, as accidental destruction of one hatchery may result in the death of up to 400 females and gilts, which may result in the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats shall be stored and shall be prohibited from killing, irritation or interference, as well as the destruction of their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish bat protection fund, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and as many native species populations are successful, we don't know."
Mr. Ronaldo rejected the accusations of rape – lawyers are going to bring the German magazine to court
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusations of rape by "melagens" and claimed that people, using his name, "are seeking to be known".
His lawyers prepared the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published the charges and brought them to court.
The attacker of the enemy of the Portuguese and Juventus clubs is charged with the rape of Kathryn Mayorg in 2009 in the hotel room of Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he had then allegedly paid a woman $375,000 to keep her quiet.
When speaking to 142 million followers in a live broadcast of Instagram a few hours after the announcements of the accusations, he criticised the reports and called them "melagens".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – the liars – said five times "Ballon d'Or" winner looking at the camera.
- Using my name they want to be famous.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I am a happy person, it's okay," the sportsman added with a smile.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of Ronaldo are about to bring Der Spiegel to court charges, which they called "unacceptable publication of suspicions of private space."
Judge Christian Schertz said that the sportsman would seek compensation for “moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation – perhaps one of the most serious violations of the rights of the individual in the last few years.”
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at Palms casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to Nevada Clark County Court, after the meeting at the night club Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman's room, where he allegedly raped her analically.
Mr Mayorga says that after an alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that there was a "99 percent good man" issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but claimed that they had been contractual.
Mr Mayorga also claims that she approached the police, and her injuries in the hospital were photographed, but later she agreed to an agreement out of court because she was "feared of countermeasures" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels injured in the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was homeless from Manchester United to Madrid Real Club, and joined the Italian giant Juventus this summer by signing a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexita. The United Kingdom would regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to the business secretary Grego Clarko, the United Kingdom would "perpetuate" if it lost its global lead in car production after Brexito.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota branch in the United Kingdom to the BBC that the withdrawal of Britain from the EU without an agreement would result in the suspension of production in the Burnaton factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car producer claimed that mortality at the border in the case of Brexit would mean job losses without an agreement.
Auris and Avensis produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory,” said the CEO of Toyota, Burnstone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without the agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that it will close its Mini plant after a month of Brexit.
According to the car manufacturers, the most worrying threat that the supply chain “Brexit” will face without a contract is the threat.
Toyota's production line works when necessary, as parts of custom-made cars are brought every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be problems at the border; according to this industry, this may delay or delay delivery of details.
Toyota claimed that it would not be possible to hold more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire plant and therefore production would stop.
According to Clark, the future plan for Theresos May Chequers for relations with the EU is "prepared precisely so as to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to use this opportunity," he said for the BBC "Radio 4" "Today".
"In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show that access to a highly successful supply chain system is necessary."
Toyota could not say that production would be stopped for a time, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Bourneton factory and who is responsible for the United trade union meetings, said that his trade union members are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that once these jobs have been lost, they will never return."
The representative of the government said: "We proposed an accurate and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, the short meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"Ongoing to fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court judges, a very important meeting of Donald Trumps with Deputy Prosecutor General Rhodes Rosenstein can be postponed for a week", said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the relationship between the Short Assistants and Russia and the possible interference of the President with the rule of law.
The question of whether Trump would release the Deputy Prosecutor General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors for many months in Washington.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed carrying a microphone for conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, in the wake of reports of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
He said he would not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed so that he did not coincide with the meeting of the Senate Committee on Courts, where he witnessed both Kavanaughas and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, the FBI ordered that the accusations made by Kavanaugh be investigated within a week, thus postponing the vote again in the plenary sitting of the Senate.
A short press representative of Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in the Fox news release.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not a fixed date, but it may take place this week, but in view of all events involving the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report the news to the press."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: from 10 September, Sanders did not hold any press conference in the White House.
Leader Chris Wallace has asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences rarely take place because they do not like TV journalists who seek "effects for viewers". True, they added: "I have to agree with the fact that they want effects for viewers."
It was then noted that Trump was more often associated with the press directly.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said and, without providing any evidence, she added: "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than to talk to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that this has happened many times over the last few weeks, and press conferences will be replaced by direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to questions constantly leaves the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
A free and sometimes strange President's appearance against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NSB workers from the EU on the concerns raised by Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the Scottish NSB workers from the EU expressing the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
The Scottish Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote: "Summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued and are approaching the expected solutions this autumn.
However, the UK Government started to accelerate the preparation of a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation of the contribution of all employees, whatever their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the functioning of the healthcare system, benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Urgent operation by Abercrombie, a head injury victim
On Saturday at 31:27, the Vanderbilt Commodores team was defeated by Christion Abercrombie, an experienced defender of the head of the competition, said the journalist Michelas Organas.
"Tennessee State" chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and just fell down there," said Reed.
Trainers and doctors at the side line of Abercrombie gave breath to oxygen, then put on the carriers and sent for further research.
Officer at Tennesse State Chris Harris of Nashville (Tenesis) WSMV said that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilto Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type and extent of injury", and Tennesse State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, who spends the official sports season, moved from Illinois and plays in the "Tennesse State" team for the first season.
Before leaving the match, on Saturday he won five balls, and the total number of balls he won during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty
Under the new sectoral plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay higher rates of stamp duty and additional money will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risk of successful Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK non-taxable persons
The Ministry of Finance expects it to be able to collect up to GBP 120 million per year and allocate them to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK are going to be taxed at a higher rate by stamp duty and that the extra money they receive is to be used to help the homeless
The promise of more affordable housing and high-income people is expected to reduce the risk posed by the success of the Jeremy Corbyn campaign for young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on tax-free persons and businesses in the UK and additional money will be used to promote the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
An additional fee – to be paid alongside the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes or homes – may amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to bring up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London is bought by non-UK residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to buy it.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making many rich countries, and especially the areas of the capital, the ghosts of cities.
The new strategy was presented only a few weeks later, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in mark fees to help more young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high real estate prices by quickly buying land, but not using it, and called on May to address the shame of British housing by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbine has announced a number of eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and a ban on unloading in the absence of fault.
He also wants to give more power to building new houses to municipal councils.
May said: “I told you last year that, as a Prime Minister, I will seek to restore the British dream – every new generation must have a better life.
And that means that we need to sort out our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that the UK non-residents and businesses established abroad can buy their homes as easily as the British working population can.
Many people's dream of having housing has become almost unfulfilled, and the threat of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team."
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become the leader of the Scottish national team.
At the age of 42, Scott likes the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, which is currently located in the third place of the first league and which is three points behind the first club.
Having taken St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the State of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to team B and it's over," Ross said to the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But as a child, I grew up in the Hamden stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national competitions, which always attracted me back.
True, this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully."
To Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy's Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals, the former head of Alloa Athletic says that he didn't feel worried about starting work after such well-known leaders in such a big club.
"Now my success will be measured by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him, but I'll probably just get him back to the league and I'll think I've been working well here."
The management career of Ross lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as a manager assistant at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
Later they helped to recover to the third division of Alloa, and turned St Mirren's club, which was threatened to fall, into the winners of the championship next season.
Ross says that he is more satisfied now than he ever felt at his career as a player in Clyde, Hardlepool, Falkrik, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy clubs.
"This change was probably radical," he remembers the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it is good for me to lead – more suitable than playing.
It sounds strange because I was lucky, I made a lot of money and was happy with the good results.
But playing can be difficult.
Every week you have to overcome many problems.
And now it is not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. As an adult, I always felt myself in my sleds, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

Studies found that the best time for beer is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased the income of the poor beer in Great Britain, but made it even more difficult for restaurant networks to bear the burden.
The figures revealed that in July sales of beer and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants income dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consulting company CGA, who produced this data, said: “Sustainable sunrise and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship meant that similar trends continued in July as in June, when beer income increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, restaurant trade dropped by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation got worse.
The results of the commercial beer and bars have undoubtedly been the best in terms of the main income from the sale of beverages, and trade in them has increased more strongly than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the main income from the sale of food beer was also affected by the sun.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-ordered breweries and bars sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent this month, while food sales dropped by 3 per cent."
Paulas Newmanas, an analysis company in the leisure and fitness sector, says RSM: “These results continue to show a trend since the end of April.
With regard to catering, air and the impact of major social and sporting events remain key factors.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to suffer. It is true that the drop in sales of 4.8 percent for several years will be particularly painful because it will contribute to the continuing cost pressure.
The businesses that received the most income from trade in food could not have had a long hot summer at a worse time. Time will show whether the milder temperature in August will provide the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in beer and restaurants, including newly opened destinations, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of branding networks.
In the UK, the beer, bars and restaurants sector and its guidelines are recognised by The Coffer Peach Tracker as a sales monitoring tool for collecting and analysing operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts from their parents
The study revealed that one in five children, some only 11 years old, has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 high school students revealed an increasing number of fake Insta pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account to show their parents
One of the five children, some only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing at a rapid rate, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said they used a censored basic account for their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret 13-year-old daughter's website, found out that her teenager insists: "You rape me."
A study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of students aged 11-18 have two accounts, while half of such students have recognised the accounts as hiding.
"The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where they cannot be found by their parents and teachers is worrying."
Eilidha Doyle will be the vote of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected a consultant at the general annual meeting of the leadership body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Doyle is a Scottish lighthouse and chairman who has won the most awards. Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from various international experiences that she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has gained great respect for the entire Scottish, UK and world sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Council will bring great benefits to Scottish sport,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope I will really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The game of 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlantic Games and the total of four Olympic gold medals were won by an American, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, who could not walk after an experience of a short-term ischaemic attack.
He wrote: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
I needed to work until I was exhausted, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I do my exercise of mobility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Breast milk advertising, which compares mothers to cows, received different assessments on the Internet
The dairy company received different opinions about its advertising, which compares mothers to dairy cows.
In order to mark the start of the sale of a product described as the world's first quiet portable breast lift, the consumer technology company Elvie has published an inspired advertisement for an ironic music record.
Four true mothers dance in this whole military, according to a sound recording, for example, the words: "Yes, I am lying to myself, but no tails to see" and "If you haven't noticed, here is not the udder, here is my breasts."
The appendix goes on to say, "Get him out, pull him out, feed him to babies, pull him out, pull him out, milk my beautiful ones."
However, the advert published on Facebook caused an online dispute.
A video of 77 000 times reviewed and received several hundred comments responded in various ways, and many said that it was looking at the horrors of the dairy industry.
"To advertise this product with cows is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and have given birth to milk, but their newborns are born a few days later," wrote one woman.
"Elvie" breast milking inescapable room in the feeding bra ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another comments: “It is said that it causes injury to both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for advertising that presents breast milk for mothers who don't take away babies?"
Another added: "Advertising is a total misunderstanding."
Another commentator defended the ad – one woman admitted that the song appeared to her "very fun".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I'd still feed it.
When I got off my milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it like what it is.
This article is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertising is intended for mothers whose milk goes away (often in workplaces or toilets) and feels like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that all of the dances with unseen milky bras.
The campaign idea is based on the idea that many women who stop breast milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's milk, however, does not spread any sound, has no wires or tubes and an invisible room in the feeding bra – it allows women to move freely, keep babies or even leave their homes when they withdraw their milk.
"Mother" partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie's draw is a revolutionary product, which deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
When feeding women compared with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and to all the challenges it poses, at the same time as having fun and as much as possible to the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk supply will bring.
Elvie's milking into the headlines of the press has not been the first time.
During the fashion week in London, designer Marta Jakubowski’s mother demonstrated her two children on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp at the Texas border
During the month, the number of people crossing the border has remained largely unchanged, but the number of children detained has increased significantly, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies of the Short-Governor Administration making it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most guardians were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid of the risk of staying in the country when applying for child care.
In June, when the Federal Government announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, the Chief Executive of Immigration and Customs, Matthew Albence, testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozens of people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had not been tried before.
"Almost 80 percent of these people – guardians or members of their families – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to the shelter workers, in order to discuss cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules, according to which some children in court must appear within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, as was the case before.
Many will try to defend the application for legal status against a judge on immigration issues, not when he comes personally, but by using a video call at a conference.
Those who do not have the right to receive aid will be quickly deported.
According to the shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely it is that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to acts of violence or attempts to escape.
Defenders say that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as Tornil’s shelter, where the size increases the likelihood of unseen signs of child suffering.
They added that the relocation of children to the tent town without sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could deepen the trauma experienced by many.
Syria told the U.S., France and Turkey to leave immediately.
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though war has been taking place in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that the foreign forces in Syria, under the pretext of combating terrorism, are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem argued that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this sacred fight until we have both the terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
Syria has around 2 000 United States troops who are training and consulting the Kurd Forces and Syrian Arabs that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1 000 land-based troops in a war-destructed country.
Regarding the refugee problem, Moualem argued that the conditions for their return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fears that deter refugees from returning.
"We came to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assada and the opposition reach political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib in the last major insurgent Fortress created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for clear deadlines, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards the Jihadist, including the fighters from the Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a committee composed of the Government and members of the opposition to prepare the draft post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the committee: the work of the group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, his presidency would have been terminated earlier by impeachment and scandal.
Of course this would be the most dramatic end of the Presidency ever!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue among viewers.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time ratings on CNN TV have increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost three times to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcasting time, the number of which has grown from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC The Rachel Madlow Show has first place in cable TV ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main news evenings.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, who produces ABC series Descedent about the secretary of the Cabinet, who becomes president after the attack at the Congress Palace.
Nell Scovell, an experienced co-media writer and author of "Only the fun parts and some unpleasant truths as secret access to the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote in favour of Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He's laughing at me," said Scovell.
Chaos is valuable because he's entertaining.
Of course, unlike the show shown on television, the stories coming from Washington may determine the future of the case in Roe v Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
A lack of vision is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged viewers.
However, it is more than necessary to be informed to the citizen when you realise that you have been watching, for six hours, a group of experts are discussing how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort shows 15 000 US dollars-costing dandruff leather jacket (“store-dressed trims”, wrote The Washington Post), and what the shocking description of Storm Daniels Trump's anatomy means.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions resemble a reality show, because every night he throws you something," said the Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pown Stars Brent Montgomery, about the changing characters of the Short Show and the daily winds of the story (involvement with N.F.L. or praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss any series, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north coast of the Battle was 27 degrees of heat and the sun was light, but he drank inside and, recording CNN, watched MSNBC.
He couldn't get rid of it – not when Britta Kavanaughu had a station against the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
"I remember when we once made those crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The hard fight of the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives is being waged by money from around
It is no wonder that the conversion of Congress districts, which ended with the attempt of two Members of the House to win the same post, resulted in money pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania.
The recently redesigned suburban Pittsberg County has involved the Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamba in the fight, who won his place in a different constituency last spring in special elections.
Lamb competed with another Member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the previous 12th county of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps are reflected when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that, in violation of the constitution, the old districts were fused for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the election fight in the new 17th district, financial institutions of major parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCK) – were concerned about campaign finance.
Lamb in Pennsylvania became famous when a small majority in the 18th Congress district won the wide-ranging special elections held in March.
For more than a decade this place was occupied by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the County.
Political experts gave the democrats some advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but then calming down
The diplomats noted that Beijing had already been recognised by the Dominican Republic and Panama, but in principle had not received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump participated in a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the partners moved the “Trump Organization” management.
"For the decisions taken recently, the officials of the state department of Taiwan decided to remove the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," said Heather Nauert in a report published earlier this month.
However, sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received American aid worth around USD 140 million in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions on individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an important step forward in order to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to take place, and so they concluded in principle any reflection on sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to demonstrate the importance of the administration for this assembly, Vice President Mike's Pence has now been added to the list of speakers at the conference scheduled for mid-October,” the diplomats said.
And three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any attacks or punishments from Washington.
A representative of the White House refused Bolton to comment on the details of the debate, which were discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
In the future, it is inevitable to wait for a report by special advisor Robert Mueller on the possible interference of Trump to justice – very strong evidence of this is now available in public archives.
Furthermore, as it is said, Mueller raises the question of whether the Trump campaign has not been conducted in secret cooperation with Russia, which has damaged our elections.
If the Congress were to move to another hand, it would be up to the short one to take responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he is going to re-enter the voters and perhaps finally the executive commission.
There is a great deal of "if" here and I do not say that the end of the short one is inevitable, just like its equivalent in Europe.
We will all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether or not the battle will continue for a long time.
In 1938 German officials were ready to demolish Hitler – only needed the West to resist him and support Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We broke down, and we missed an opportunity to stop the slaughterhouses that lasted several years later.
History is about such fundamental turning points – then the undeaf democratic march is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans are now facing several such fundamental turning points.
What if Trump releases the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a person who depends on the fate of Mueller's investigation?
The problems of Rosenstein began when this newspaper reported that last year the official offered to secretly record the president and thought about his ineligibility to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says that The Times's story is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI of Bretto Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite the persuasive accusations of sexual coercion and false evidence, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in favour of the Congress in the mid-term elections, which will force the short one to take responsibility?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy is threatened with a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once based in my home as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years I was sent to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swastic.
When I have such an inheritance, how can I view our future unoptimistically?"

Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Rapid Vienna from Rangers
Rangers "Rapid Vienna" will be accepted on Thursday, knowing that if after the impressive match with "Villarreal" against the Austrians held earlier this month in Spain, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to the trauma of the road, the middle player Graham Dorrans could have appeared for the first time this season only at 2:2 in the end of the race with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers Club can use this result as a trample towards more important goals.
"It was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
“We started playing believing that we will achieve something, and we ended up doing it.
Perhaps we could have been more ambitious at the end, but overall the competition was not bad.
They must've been better at playing the first podium, and we've stretched into the second one, and we've shown out who we're a better team.
Thursday will be another important evening of the European League.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough, because it has been an excellent result in the last matches, but I have no doubt that with the support of the audience we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the workouts are great.
I hope that we can now come forward, forget last season and play successfully."
This fear of pension savings causes women to suffer from insomnia
Although the surveyers had a clear picture of what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke to family members about this.
About half of “Nationwide” survey respondents said that they talked to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't try to talk about it," Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide life insurance company, said.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not know your wishes in advance, you will not prepare your family to take care of you.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these can be important to predict costs.
Get a financial adviser, and the adviser can also help you to figure out how to pay these costs.
Long-term care may decide to pay for these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed life assurance certificate or an asset insurance for as long as you have the money.
Form legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by issuing documents.
Make sure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
In addition, think about the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you become inefficient.

A man shot several times in an Ilfrakum with a pneumatic gun
After spending the evening in town, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
The victim was shot in his chest, in his belly, and in his hand forty years in the region of Ilfracum in Oxford Grauv, Devon.
Around 02.30 p.m., officials described the shooting performed during England’s summer time as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police ask for witness assistance.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 died when a powerful earthquake and a tsunami struck Palu in Indonesia on Friday,” the officials say.
As a result of the destruction of communications, no data could be obtained from the officers of the emergency services from the Regency of Dongala, north of the Palu area close to the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
In the event of a disaster, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawes.
In 2017, approximately 379 800 inhabitants of Pala are the capital of the province of Sulawesi, which was established at the end of the bay on the narrow western coast of the island of Sulawesi.
When the earthquake hit the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a retentivity stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulawes in the northwest.
In 2017, around 299 200 inhabitants lived in the Regency – a smaller administrative region than the province.
Fishing and farming are key pillars of the economy in the central province of Sulavesi, in particular in the coastal region of Dongala.
In the province, the extraction of nickel is also important, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovaly, on the other side of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have been affected several times over the last century by tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is on its Seismicly active Pacific Fire Ring, is under constant earthquakes.
Consider some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that touched 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and early April 2005, several severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, the 6.8-point quake shocked the southern part of the most densely populated Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, the 7,6-point quake shocked the area near the Western capital of Sumatra, Tyre.
More than 1 100 people were killed.
In 2010, the 7.5-point quake shocked one of the Isles of Mentavai near Sumatra and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres reaching, killing dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, Pidiya Jai Regency, which was located in Aceh as a result of a small earthquake, was devastation and panic, because people remembered how everything was taken after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami failed, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong tremors shocked Indonesia's tourist visit to Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the coast.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is detained for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former Governor of Alaska and of the candidate for Vice-President of Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police, 29 - year - old Palin from Vasilla (Aliaska) has been arrested with suspicions of domestic violence, interference with the reporting of domestic violence and detention.
According to a police report, when he tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palin was returned to the pre-trial detention facility for the pre-trial detention and released for a deposit of $500.
"Today he appeared in court, where he was asked to justify himself, said he was totally innocent," he reported the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means that a fine of USD 250 000 may be imprisoned and punished for up to one year.
He's being accused of Class B's violation, having a day in prison and having a fine of USD 2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Toddo Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently under discussion by the Alaska Veterans Court.
This event is linked to the charges against him by the attack at home in January 2016, the obstruction to report the crime of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while being in a stateless state.
His girl said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism of the Veterans groups, when his son’s cruel behavior was associated with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people died on Friday after being hit by a tsunami on the island of Sulawes.
The 7,5 - point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulaves, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The social media is sharing videos showing the moment of tsunami shock.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered in the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek the suspect of a New York terrorist attack with low executions
In New York, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for the Sayful Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that had not been executed in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
On 31 October, it is suspected that 30-year-old Saipov of the Home Depot hired a truck and held an attack on the bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – on the trail, stooped pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the report on the intention to seek a death penalty in southern New York County, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious personal injury.
According to the court's document, both points of charge can lead to a death penalty.
After several weeks of the attack, the Federal Grand Sworn Jury announced to the Saipow the indictment of 22 points, including eight accusations of extortion of property (usually in organised crime cases by federal prosecutors), and the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and thought out in advance, and that the way in which Saipov did it was described as a blasphemy, cruel and immoral.
"The actions of Sayfulull Habibullaevius Saipov caused injury, suffering and loss of family members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelio, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drakë, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchio, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandr Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent is given in the report.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case, which required a death penalty, was dealt with in the South District of New York a decade ago.
Incarcerated Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death for two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in 1953 in the New York federal case for the spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, who were sentenced two years ago to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to judicial documents, Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he did.
According to the accused act, Saipov revealed to the officials that he was inspired by the Islamic State (ISIS) videos on his phone to execute the attack.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital room to hang the Islamic flag.
He did not admit his fault according to the 22 blasphemy points.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders of the Saipov, said that they are obviously disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to admit the guilt and to prison to live without being released, will only prolong the injury of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
In the past, Saipov's defence team asked prosecutors not to reach the death penalty.
The Tori Parliamentary says that NIGELAS FARAGEAS must be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Torus Conference, Nigel Farage has promised to mobilise the nation’s army.
A former UKIP leader said that politicians should feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, and one of the parliamentarians of the Theresa May party proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boneñas, a Conservative Member of the House of Commons, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if the Secretary of Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unify the divided ranks of supporters were revealed by the EU-sponsors who joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement his agreed compromise plan in Chekers when it is attacked by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on her trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and forced the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bonée said through the Leave Means Leave at Solihale that he wanted to destroy the Čekers plan.
He argued that Farage had to be an equivalent partner and had to be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led us, we would have already left the EU," he said.
The Velingboro Member added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Čekers Plan."
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we have not fought to obey others.
We want our laws in our own country."
“The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit's support tour Andrea Jenkins also took part in the demonstrations and told journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, hear the people.
The Czechs' plan is unpopular among the general public and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, above all, vote for us.
Get rid of the Čekers plan and start listening."
In her critical report, May added: "Premiers keep their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said that those who feed politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they give up the decision taken by referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a question of trust for us, for the people and for our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, so today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it."
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel hot.
We are mobilising the army of this country's nation, which has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And the opponents of Brexit marched the streets of Birmingham before having a two-hour campus in the city center.
When the group formed this weekend, a group of activists were waving in posters "Toori v. "Brexit".
Leiborist Lord Adonis was a self-preserved conservator for the security problems they experienced due to the party app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the "Canada plus plus" option, for borders without friction and for free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential elections.
"Boston Globe" reported that Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the re-elections in November, where he will meet with GOP representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was suggested that it could negotiate with the Short Year 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok has been its 36th meeting with voters using the format of the public meeting with the public.
One participant asked if it planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the disgusting government, and women must lead it.
Arrested suspect in the LSU Simso shooting case
On Saturday, the Louisiana Baton Rouge police reported that they had detained a suspected person accused of killing LSU basketball player Wayde's Sams on Friday.
At 11.00, the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that twenty-year-old Dytheon Simpson had been detained.
The police distributed a Friday shooting video and asked them to help identify the man they saw.
The 20 - year - old Sims was shot and died early on Friday near the town of South University.
According to "247sports", police commander Murphy J. Paul reported to the media on Saturday that Wayde's Sams was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde's started to defend a friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, had a gun, and shot Wayde's Sams.
Simpson was arrested and was closed to the East Baton Rujo Police Department.
The 198 cm-story student Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches in the previous season, 10 of which started in five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the ground, earning 5.6 points and regaining 2.9 balls.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion when the team instructed him to give his victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday's qualification trip, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team will be very important in the race.
After starting the race from the first place, Bott was a great start and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left it in the trouble of Hamilton, encouraging Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn into a two-tracked garage, left it for the Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes turned into a two-track garage after the wheel and returned to the track outside Vettel, but after just contacting the unfinished action, it broke forward when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre to keep his position in the third turn, did not want to free the inner side of the track.
At the end of the roll, Max Verstappen, who was celebrating 21 birthdays, began to drive the seventh at the end of the first wheel.
He was the fastest part of the race, since he was driving without changing tires to get as fast as possible in the finish, bypass Kim Ruckonen and finish fourth.
Finally, in the 44th wheel, he entered a two-track garage, but in the remaining eight, he was unable to increase the pace and Rickkonen crossed the finish line by a fourth.
“It was a difficult day for Walter, because he had a great success all weekend, and when he was asked to miss me, he acted like a true gentleman.
The team worked perfectly and won two first places," he said.
It was really bad body language
On Saturday's meeting with the people, President Donald Trump suffocated Senator Dianne Feinstein because this persistently denies the leaking letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court judge Bretta Kavanaughas was accused of sexual rape.
In his speech in Western Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the Ford testimonies to the Senate's Law Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, wicked and unjust.
"What could have happened and actually happens in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger when you see that people are wicked, wicked, unclean and unjust," he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get married?
Do you remember her answer to the question? Did she get the document? “ Oh, oh, what?
No, I'm not.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we got away... no, we didn't get run out," he added, depicting the senator.
As early as July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the Ford accusations against Kavanaughui, which had been married before September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations and her history I didn't leak."
"She asked to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the president apparently did not agree with her, and at a meeting with the people on Saturday evening, he said: “You know, this was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't get married, but it was the worst language I saw in my body."
The President further defended the candidate for Supreme Court judges who were accused by the illegal sexual conduct of three women, claiming that the democrats used the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by whatever means they need.
You see grossness, grossness; they don't care what they hurt or have to pass to gain power and control," - quoted the president's speech "Mediaite".
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two goals in the match with Dandi Club "Giants"
Dundee Stars took back the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday and won the Saturday response game Dandi score 5:3.
Giants came forward early when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer gained two goals with their throws.
Michel Sullivan and Jordan Cowenie were the bulging result before Dwyer brought the Giants back forward.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team adjusted the result, but later two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goals ensured a victory.
Adam Keefe's men had the third defeat this season in the Elite League, before Friday night in Belfast, having won the Dandi Club score 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous match won by Giants.
Dwyer beat the first prize for the fourth minute (3.35) after the transfer of Kendal McFull, and after another four minutes, Beauville doubled the threshold after David Rutherford.
At the hard-starting match, Sullivan returned the arena hosts to the game, earning a goal of 13:10, and after the transfer of Matt Marquardt, Cowenie adjusted the result by 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants went out for the first break, and at the end of the first chair he won his second night's goal.
With a quantitative balance, the hosts of the square regrouped and Bouchard re-aligned the result 27:37.
Cowenie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen in his first game to break up the Dandi team at the end of the second podium, and built a victory by earning the fifth podium in the middle of the last podium.
Giants, who have already lost four of the last five matches, will meet Milton Keynes team at home the next Friday.
The commander died to help hundreds of aircraft passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he died, helping an aircraft with several hundreds of passengers to safely take off to the air.
More than 800 people have died, and many are considered missing since the severe earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulaveso on Friday.
The area is being shaken by severe repeated underground shocks and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although colleagues fled saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a highly fluctuating control tower in Palu, at Mutiara-Sis Al-Jufri airport.
He remained at his workplace to assist with the safe take-off of the 63221 Batik Air aircraft, which was already on the runway.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was going down, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, an Indonesian air navigation representative, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We were flying him by helicopter from Baikkpapan in Kaliman to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is extremely painful for us," he added.
The government fears that the number of deaths could increase to thousands, as the country’s disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigio, and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"It is believed that the number of victims will still increase, as many victims are still under ruins and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
Waves of up to six feet [6 m] in height have destroyed the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma “Sky News” 35 - year - old mother said: “Each minute, cars bring victims.
There's a lack of clean water.
Self-service stores are being robbed everywhere."
Janis Gelfanda CNN, director of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
The Indonesian president, Jacob Widod, came to Palu on Sunday and asked the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombardsk, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: "Air Nugini" now states that when the plane falls into the lagoon one person has disappeared
The flight that ended with the plane crash in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia now says that one person was missing, although earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking plane.
In Air Newgini's report, she said that she had no knowledge of one passenger man on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines indicated that they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their search for a man.
The airlines have not immediately responded to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save other passengers and crew when the plane landed at Chuck Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear what happened and what exactly the sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon that did not reach the landing path.
Some of the event’s witnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane fell from a very low point of view.
"It was very good," Jayens said.
Jaynes told me that in a sinking plane that was flooded to the waist, he and others could get to the exits of an emergency.
He said that the flight satellites were covered by panic and shouted, and he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that their sailors repaired the nearby quay also helped rescue the people who had been carried on board by an inflatable boat before the plane reached a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the aviation safety network data, 111 people have been killed during the last two decades in the accident of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Newgini.
Analyst set out a sequence of events during the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office set out the facts on Saturday's repeated case against a man who was accused of burning a woman living in 2014 from Mississippi.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to bring together the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telllis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on her night of death, which is in contradiction with previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth, saying that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he had "false because his truck was in Nashville."
Another coincidence was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died the Tellle deleted the Chambers messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Halle.
It is foreseen that the defence will start to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge argued that the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: who is the conscious hip hop?
The Hiphop Trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre, his music spreading positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hiphop is away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the sources of the hip hop and again to popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Futures and the Common have recently reborn in UK in works by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New York baby girl brought a couple to court after she was dismissed because of a "racist" message
The youth in New York brought a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a wrong address message from a mother who complains that she is "one more black".
The couple denied the race and called the action "violence".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was upset when she learned that the new child care provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEE, FOR ONE," Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to his husband.
However, she was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after having taken care of Plasco-Flaxman, he felt uncomfortable and dismissed Mr. Maurice, claiming that the previous baby girl who was an African American had done a bad job and was hoping to wait for the Filipino instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent to the house by the Uber car.
Maurice has now brought a couple to court by claiming compensation for dismissal and is seeking to order even USD 350 a day for half a year of life and work at the customer's home, to which she was initially hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday at Post, adding: "I know that this is discrimination".
The couple turned their backs on the accusations of racism by denying it and claiming that the dismissal of Maurice from work was reasonable because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the man Joel Plasz said "Post".
“Would you believe your children to someone, who you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so."
Having treated the claim as “tornage” Plaszs said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge for this?
It's not very nice behaviour," said the investment bank specialist.
While the trial was under trial, the media were shocked to condemn a couple of social networks, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not understand the bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, saying: “It’s hard to feel a different place to read the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
Saying that her father, who worked as an operator of BBC before discovering the inspiration of writing a book for children about a beating bear, would not have been too disappointed if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th year of publication of the book after the father's death was kind and sad together.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that the father was silently proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man and didn't like to be drunk," she said.
“Because Paddington was so much like him, he felt as though he had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of him, although this is not your job.
I think he had a similar assessment of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always bestowed himself on Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone
On landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Nica Louis Pasteuro 2 Hospital, where doctors could not save her life.
“Nada has always called and said that the situation is really bad, it is not expected to survive,” said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“At that time, I received a call from Nad, who called to tell her that she had two minutes to live and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said good-bye.
I told her: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines given by doctors that kept her heart beat slowly stopped working and removed from the body.
She died a little early and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I couldn't fight, scream, or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept it in myself."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, who is now mourning his dead daughter, entered the plane with other passengers who do not understand how difficult the test is to be overcome.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was down, and I had tears all the time.
It was difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's Vulnerable Postcards are designed to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones have tried to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distribute cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call and seek help.
Mr. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want one father to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old resident in the air, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted the room."
But he quit work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at that time, found his own brother who had committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said: "I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction can take place."
Mr. Davis has created cards “to let people know that there are people around whom you can contact and talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Marco, who left his life shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, depressed, nor complained to anyone," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his new attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children pulled out their gifts, he didn't look at them and did nothing."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family it has left emptyness.
It's kind of frowning our heart.
But we all have to live and fight."

At the launch of the FBI investigation, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh fell on the hair
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a study of a limited duration and scope – maybe we would bring some unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "be" in the strong suffocation of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their opposition is determined by time alone.
Until the middle of the term of office, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks have to be left and, if the Republicans are expected to prove bad, their efforts to elect the person they want to go to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators, trying to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, former personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently includes 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh Senate can receive 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate his contacts and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came in power, the number of North Korea’s deserts "death"
South Korean legislator said the number of North Korean deserts to South Korea fell when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
The Park Byeong-Seugas, quoted by the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, said that last year 1 127 deserts were identified compared to 2 706 deserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were strengthened border control between North Korea and China and increased smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not submit any public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war, more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised area (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China regards deserts as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced them back to their homeland.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still currently fighting technically, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang at the heart of the nuclear narration negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when both agreed in principle to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not having changed their sanctions since then.
"If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally arm the first one," said Mr. Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh calls him "isterical" and states that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the House of Representatives Minority Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court judge Bretta Kavanaugh "isterical" and said that he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr Pelosi made these comments during the interview given on Saturday at "Texas Tribune" festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't just think that if a woman did so, it would be said that she was hysterical," Mr Pelosi expressed his reaction to the evidence given by Mr Kavanaugh to the Courts Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had committed sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when she spoke about family and high school time, Mr Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he did not begin to shout or gossip.
He also condemned the Democrats in the Committee in their entirety, who were accused of being called "the porous and co-ordinated destruction of their reputation", which was organised by the Liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that the evidence given by Kavanaugh showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased attitude towards the democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his own statements and with the attack of the Clinton and Democratic Party," she said.
When asked whether he would seek to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidature had been approved and the Democrats in the House of Representatives had received a majority of votes, Mr Pelosi objected.
"I will say this – if he lies to Congress or FBI, it is not appropriate to perform his duties not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Mr. Pelosi.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the Colombian Regional Appeal Court.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh as a democracy regarding the Law on Access to Health or the 'Roe v Wade' case as a conservative judge.
At the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions about the revocation of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterically, biased personality to become a judge to say, "How wonderful!" – said N. Pelosi.
The power that women should exercise
This is a legitimate criticism – after the last months and even years, it has accumulated an indignation that it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Steinem after 45 years.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, but it doesn't look unusual for you?"
She continued: “I was very much helped by a woman, head of some company, when she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a method: when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
In fact, I'm angry."
And she just cried.
It seemed brilliant to me."
The tears are considered acceptable for the expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most prominent memories is from one of the first works at the office, where most men worked, and where I once began to cry for irresistible anger. Then I was taken by an older woman, a harsh head, who was always a bit scared, and stretched out to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying, ” said me.
- They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
A member of the Congress of the Democratic Party from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Charter during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Khartos was caught by a stranger on board the Monkey Business (aphorism, which means lightly spent time) and took up his candidacy, Mr Schroeder felt deeply disappointed that there was no reason why he could not stand as presidents himself.
“ It wasn’t a well thought - out decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
– At that time there were seven other candidates, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snowing with seven thumbs."
When the campaign started late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore her not to announce her candidacy until she collects 2 million dollars.
It was an uneven fight.
She noticed that some of the supporters who had donated $1,000 to men only used 250.
“ Did they think I got a discount?” she thought.
When speaking about the beginning of a formal campaign, it was so equipped with emotions – gratitude for people, a disappointment system that made it very difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly and not representatives, and anger about sexism – that it was outrageous.
“You would have thought that I had been nervous, ” recalled Mr Schroeder’s press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought that I was supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what would be contained in my grave monument.
"She cried?"
How the US and Chinese trading generations can benefit Beijing
The first frosts in the U.S.-China trade war have been aroused, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say that strife may eventually become useful to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most pronounced resistance took place this week, when new tariffs came into force, affecting goods worth USD 200 billion (GB 150 billion), i.e. half of Chinese exports to the US.
Beijing replied to all the measures at the same time, with a customs duty of between five and ten per cent on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the US tooth for a tooth, and it seems that this second largest world market is certainly not going to land in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only be relaxed if China obeyed requirements, but publicly bowing the US would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing takes a proper play of its party, the difficulties of the trade war with the US may have a positive impact on China over time, as they will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that would cause both countries to lose their economies is, in fact, more dangerous than the observers have so far recognised," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute "Asia in the New American Security Center".
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
When speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The progress made in combating terrorism in the territory has made the situation much more stable and secure," he said.
The government continues its efforts to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore the situation to normal.
All the conditions have already been put in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and well-being.
The UN estimates that Syria has been left by some 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in the reconstruction of the country that has been destroyed.
However, it was also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, having negotiated the final result of the U.S. team 16,5:10,5, won the Riga Cup Le Golf National in the square next to Paris (France) in 2018.
The United States has already lost its sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn gathered 14.5 points that were enough to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who was hard at all in the tournament, launched a blow from the startground straight to the water at the end of the 16th hole on 3rd day in the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player, F. Molinari, joined all rounds and became one of the four players who reached the score of 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained its current form.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 won the lowest ranking European team player in Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1 of the world's top ranking loses English to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The veteran of the eight Ryder tournaments, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of this tournament at all times, collecting 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing and believing me.
I am very happy, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad I was able to help," said Emotional S. Garcia after the victory of Europeans.
He is sending an estafe to his compatriot John Ram, who in the game of Sunday units in 2:1 agreed the US golf legend Tigger Woods.
"I'm incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his match in France and now he owns 13-21-3 "Ryder" cup track record.
These are strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest prizes and landed only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed all weekend to hit the driving lawn, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
Captain J. Furyk of the United States said after a disappointing team: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we were pressing Europeans.
We're fighting.
I'm going to get a hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I can be their captain.
You have to slow down your head.
Our opponents were superiors."
