Bedford mayor of Bourdeaux honors the trafficker Lina Ognissanti
Photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season of the year, while in winter it sells springs.
For more than 40 years, a woman will be honored when she is sold with specic and ice cream in the city centre and has a private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who sells ice cream and ginger on Dinky Donuts Bedford on the Midland Road, was invited to the afternoon tea with his family.
Almost 3 000 people have signed a petition online to be awarded or recognised.
Mr Ognissanti said that she had the honour of receiving such praises.
According to Bedford mayor Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and the children and grandchildren were invited to his office to see the regals and historical artifacts of the city and to drink papiet's tea.
"Lina Bedforfe holds a special place, and its kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lin for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked, in her words, the "comfortful" inhabitants of Bedford who thought of her, and said: "This is a great honor and a beautiful act."
The petitioner, Sarkab Mahmood, said that he did not expect so many signatures.
When he heard about the reception planned for the end of the year, he said: "I am very pleased about Linna, because she deserved it because of her great character."
On the road with Alster's Lambretta Club
Motors "Lambretta" were irreplaceable fashion cultural satellites in the 1960s.
The group of Italian motorist fans tries to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Lambretta club in Alster, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland were gathered this weekend in the region of Fermana.
One of the two first club members, Chris Wilson, acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“For me, the motorist was just a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in other ways.
It was some kind of sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old for that," he said.
"He was quite cheap and quite reliable, he could have been bought at an affordable price, and he bought something more than just to go from point A to point B."
He took part in Lambretta's separate start race at the Isle of Man TT ring.
Alster's first Lambretta Club was founded in the early 1980s and restructured 12 years ago.
“About 1971, the motorists and other forms of transport were increasingly interested in people, and the clubs were hit by the general upheaval, so I thought, "Everything, it's the end," said Chris.
"Then sometime again there was interest, and it seems that it grew more and more."
Philip Steele is the Secretary to the Lambretta Club of Alster, which currently has 97 members, with responsibility for membership.
“The motives of all are different.
Some members have been influenced by the fashion culture, since almost everything started from it.
Others are enthusiasts or handicrafts – here you will find all sorts of people.
There are some who just have an interesting vintage.
Many of the motorists have been modified, so there are no two equally.
It is possible to keep the engine stationary and drive at 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to narrow Italian streets, but some members have improved this.
Some heavily modified motorists could probably reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, there were some problems, some of which had to be started by pushing on.
And even though the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the Italian homeland of Lambretta, this time the sun shined to the motorists driving in the region of Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks the authors for silence on the question of “Brexito”
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow Conservatives for a "tyle period" so that the Prime Minister could reach an agreement on "Brexito".
The head of the Scottish industry said that there was enough time for the debate within two years of the EU referendum.
She expressed her opinion following Boris Johnson's words about the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "the crazy and completely absurd".
She said that it was time to support the Prime Minister's programme for the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland.
At the party conference in Birmingham, which brought together Tori activists, she said: “In the past two years we have had time for debate.
The former Foreign Secretary was a member of one of the best offices in the country's history and during that period a large part of the current plan, which had already been recognised in November last year, was drawn up.
Conservatives now need to support the Prime Minister, allow her to close the deal and help with the plans in the country.
I think that a period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed a sharp criticism in the Brexito debate, which was stated for the first time by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured you that you believe in Brexitu and that its office plan could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr. Davidson also said that participating in other elections would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, because in 2014, "the Szots promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible re-referendum on Brexito, she replied: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that you cannot repeat a referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would be more confused if I said that another referendum could be held on Brexito, because I expected a different result."
Road M8 after the police incident reopened
The M8 motorway was reopened after the police incident at Glasgow.
According to the police, a few years earlier than 07:00 was closed in both directions at the 15 Townhead intersection, when there was concern about the pedestrian.
Traffic on a closed road did not take three hours and was disturbed in the city where the "Green Scottish Run" took place.
In 20 C.E., the man was later taken to the Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
A friend of Christine's Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual abuse suspected of Brent Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was a middle school friend of Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford, accused a candidate to the Supreme Court of the sexual violence of Britta Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that although he did not remember the party in the house where the attack might have taken place, he believed in the story of Ford.
In the past, Keyser made a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember the party and did not even know if he met Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, when witnessing against the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser's statement that she believed in Ford.
On Friday, President Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a study during the week when the Republican senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked for time to postpone the vote of the entire Senate on Kavanaugh for a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter through his lawyer to the Committee stating that he wanted to ‘contribute to an additional investigation into the FBI’ for Kavanaugh.
"However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the party or gathering in which he would have been with or without Dr. Ford," says Keyser's lawyer Howard Walsho.
The letter further explains that Keyser "does not reject Dr. Ford's story and has already said to the press that you believe in Dr. Ford's certificate."
"However, the simplest and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot confirm it because it does not remember the event" - continues in the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, allegedly close to the attack, said he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
Unlawfully convicted residents of Chicago tell about life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that the innocent policeman exploited the innocent population of social housing and misappropriated a large number of people.
To date, 42 people have been convicted illegally.
At present, the Ida B. Wells project is just an empty place for the social housing project, and in the past, more than a decade, the corrupt policemen in Chicago have almost been taking advantage of anything.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical team of extortion of property, forgery of police reports and evidence and coercion.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those sentenced to this date by Kim Fox, General Prosecutor of Cook County.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and earning," Cleon Glover said about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get away from that district,
But I had nowhere to go," said Willie Martin.
Fox Ethics Division lawyers review further 30-40 Wattsu related cases.
Landon Allen, a resident of social housing, Ida B. Wells, said that many people decided not to remain silent about Watts.
"Many did not keep quiet," he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed in the people’s words about the sergeant sergeant.
“He has a gang.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at the Chicago university’s certification project, says that until now no one really believed them.
"Everything longed because they didn't seem important to them and they didn't care, because they were black people living in social housing, so it was thought that they were still guilty of something," Teppher said.
‘Sergeant Watts has been in prison for 22 months in 2013 for trying to steal the FBI informer.
Martez Wise was also put in prison by Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost knew me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," said Wise.
"I lost my business for four years."
The 72-year-old Fidelity believes in the success of block circuits, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of "Fidelity" blocks chains was noticed until 2018, when all corporations started to talk about this technology.
Director General Abby Johnson has managed to invest in cryptovulists, the most risky and volatile asset class of recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior managers were just curious about what was happening, especially in the bitcoins market," said Johnson.
We started talking, and we realized that we had to find out.
The curiosity led to the "casting" of bitcoins in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this cryptovulette was about $180.
Last December the price was almost $20 000, and, said Johnson, "we were surprised that when the price rose we started to earn, even though we never expected it."
She didn't indicate how many bitcoins she "excavated" or how much Fidelity earned.
The workers of Fidelity are clearly interested in these technologies.
A block chain club for employees, called "Bitus and Blocks", which hosts seminars and meetings with specialists, now has about 2 600 members.
The company has agreed with Coinbase, which has given Fidelity customers the opportunity to check the cryptovulette balance using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, bitcoins were made available.
Johnson argued that the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or rejected them for at least a short time.
We're trying to keep an eye on the market.
In the meantime, Katie Chase, the chief strategist of the Fidelity Application Technology Centre and the head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), are looking for ways to use public and business-used block chains.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but revealed that there was a high level of interest from customers, partners and employees.
“It’s all very new.
If you take a look at the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find proof of the concept," said Chase.
We tried to adapt the block chains to different situations and learned a lot, but the technology is not so advanced as to be able to solve such problems."
In the meantime, the group is paying more attention to attempts to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, with tokens or to use block circuits in the supply chain.
"What's not at the heart of this, but I think it's going to get an interest in the end," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready for this."
She set an example for the Pebble watch, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but finally paid back to Fidelity.
Its group created an app for the smart clock that stopped manufacturing after three years, after collecting millions through the Kickstarter's crowdfunding project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly applied the Pebble app to the new Apple product.
“We were not blindly convinced that the Pebble clock would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches,” she said.
"We have accumulated knowledge and we were ready when smart clocks were released to the mass market."
An earthquake and a tsunami on the island of Sulawes
On Friday, September 29, the Indonesian island of Sulawes was hit by a powerful 7.5 - point earthquake that caused a tsunami and killed almost 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead people is expected to grow.
According to a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, electricity and communication are not functioning, making it difficult to assess the damage in Palu and in the nearby fishing community in Dongala.
California’s students wear a T-shirt with racist notes
According to CNN branch KGV, the Escondidian Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had made a poorly thought-out decision to demonstrate racism at an event dedicated to senior classes.
"We are proud to welcome everyone in our school and to fear diversity," said Director Adriana Lepe-Ramire in the report.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by the Escondida Secondary School, Union officials and local police.
"The school administrators contacted the parents and guardians of the wrongful pupils and will be subject to disciplinary sanctions," states the report.
According to a report from the police station, students of the school north of San Diego were wearing t-shirts in exclusivity styles, with letters from which a racist inscription was written, and they were photographed when they were worn.
Usually, the school confirms the notes in advance, but some students choose their own words when taking an official photo.
The Union report states that such behaviour "is not compatible with the culture, values or history of the Escondid high school".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions that we make every day," said Lepe-Ramires.
"Escondida Secondary School will continue to foster family values and unity-based culture throughout the community."
The former student, Cade Pannell, said to KGV that a insulting picture in social media had offended him.
"This insulted me personally," he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but it’s not.
Only inexperienced people can laugh at such things."
Shareef, son of Shaquile O'Neal, waiting for heart surgery, spends the 1st UCLA season
Shareef, the son of Shaquile O'Neal, a member of the Basketball Museum of Fame, will have to spend the first UCLA season due to a heart disorder.
According to the “TMZ Sports”, O’Nealui will undergo heart surgery to eliminate the disorder noted by UCLA doctors during the normal examination.
"Thank God, UCLA doctors have early noticed the problem," O'Neal said in TMZ.
“As long as rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and I will be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed the official protocol of intent in August, promising to play in UCLA team, which has already attracted a number of famous names and is one of the best first-rate teams of the country in 2018-2019 season.
"Shareef has improved significantly in high school," said Steve Alford, Chief Trainer at Bruin last month.
“He is high, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of a new team.
We are happy with the composition of this year's team and Shareef will be an excellent complement to it.
It has a good basis and will be able to improve on both ends of the board."
According to the data of "247Sports", O'Neal of 18 years of age is a 4-star candidate, 2018 newcomers rank 8 as a heavy attacker of the country and 41 as a player.
Before joining the UCLA, O'Nalas helped Crossroads to achieve a record 25:9.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is accused of violence against his father
The 28-year-old Track Palin was arrested for three offences, including the attack.
On Sunday, he has been arrested for family violence for the first time.
According to the court records, the incident occurred at the Palin House in Vasil, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father, Todd, by arguing about the truck.
28 years after the Saturday incident, he was arrested for three offences, including an attack.
Judgment documents indicate that the dispute occurred when the man called to take the truck, but the father refused to give it to him.
As explained by the court statement, Track Palin was arrested by charges of first degree hacking and fourth degree attack and fourth degree misdemeanour, and his father was injured in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called his speaking police "simple" and ordered them not to use their weapons.
The court’s statement also indicates that the man was on the garage roof before being arrested.
The trial records Sarah Palin's words that her son was "agitated" and "used some kind of medicine".
It was also noted that Track Palin said that he had used to drink several bottles of beer to the police.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and accused of domestic violence against a woman, of obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of.
“Seeing my son, what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand other families suffering the consequences of a post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know what soldiers come back to be injured,” said the former Republican candidate for vice presidents and governor of Alaska.
"Now I know better than ever that the best in America need a chief executive, who will respect and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren claims to think about standing for President after the mid-term election
“It is time for women to march to Washington and correct the failed government that women have to lead,” said the senator of democrats speaking to the crowds meeting at the Holjok Town Hall of Massachusetts.
"So I promise this: after 6 November, think well about whether it is worth applying for Presidential status."
Warren, who tried to defend his post in the matches with the Republican representative of the state, Geoff Diehlu, has previously said that he is not a candidate for President because he wants to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections of the term of office and to stop acting as if the only important thing was the year 2020", she said to the reporters in August when she spoke to the National Press Club.
"The most important fight is the mid-term election of the term of office, which is important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been seen as a potential candidate for democrats in 2020, able to compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would expect a difficult initial election battle, which may involve other well-known democrats – former Vice-President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Senator.
With celebrities in mental health clinic associated with the third mystic death in less than a year
According to The Mail, three people have committed suicide in a luxury psychiatric clinic before more than a year.
Shaquelle Vidal, a daughter of a TV comic, died on 7 April, almost a month on a voluntary basis in West London, Marylebone, a hospital in Nightingale.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) – a manager of a hedge fund, a millionaires and a former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid for five years of her supervision.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the day that the celebrity celebrity of Daisy Boyd (28 C.E.) became a granddaughter of Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe.
D. Boyd died after being separated from his heir, Dan Macmillan (in 43 years), who suffered from the death of D. Boyd on October 5 due to cocaine, which was illegally brought by a visitor of the clinic.
Two months ago, the artist Alan MacDonald (61), who had left the hospital four days since he was released, left his life.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not make sufficient efforts to prevent illicit substances from being introduced.
The daughter of Avo Vidal, the "Mock The Week", registered in the BBC clinic on 11 March.
Last week, in a preliminary hearing at the Westminster Coronary Court, Royal Advocate Katie Gollop said that Shaquell had disappeared from AWOL on 29 March and returned a week later in a deteriorating mental state.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquell, who she has been talking to and what she has been doing."
Mr. Lyle, she called Shaquelle a "boy."
The informal stepfather of Shaquell is called the co-media director John Gordillo (52 C.E.): "I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at that time."
At the meeting, Mr Gordoll revealed that on April 4 Shaquelle called him and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and he called the clinic 20 minutes after the call "more than a dozen times", but no one responded.
"I think that further events could be avoided if someone responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinician found Shaquell's mental condition to be extremely poor."
In less than 48 hours, she had a notebook.
A representative of the Nightingale expressed his condolences to family and friends and said: "The goal of our clinic is to provide high quality care in a safe, therapeutic environment."

"Led Zeppelin" is again brought to court because of the alleged stolen guitar reef of "Stairway To Heaven"
"Led Zeppelin" has again been sued for the guitar reef used in the 1971 song "Stairway To Haven", which the group supposedly stole.
It is said that some of the British group's hito in 1971 has been washed.
The Court of Appeal rejected the judgement of 2016 that the group did not copy under the name of another group "Spirit".
The application was lodged in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, the trustee of Spirit guitarist.
It seems that the trial on “Led Zeppelin” song “Stairway To Haven” will last for a long time – just like the song itself.
The group will again stand up against the court for the charges of stealing the71-year-old guitar reef.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the judgement of 2016 that the group did not copy the first hit from the music of the "Spirit" group.
It is argued that the judge made errors, such as false information to jury on copyright law.
The case has been referred back to court.
Michael Skidmore, trustee of Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, brought his first action in 2015.
The police in Michigan ended when the policeman crossed the suspected murderer who shot them
In her girl's murder, the suspected Mitchigan resident was arrested after the police gangs that ended him in the middle of the police car.
It is suspected that in 33, Adam Nolin shot his girl, a 27-year-old Tia Mae Randall, on Thursday in Michigan, Wajoming.
He's been brought to court on Friday at the hospital, where the officer took him across a SUV police car, because Nolin shot the police to try to escape the motorway, where he was on heavy traffic.
Nolin has been accused of five serious crimes, including an attack to kill and escape the police.
“The return to hospital is not normal, but this is not the first case,” said the master of Wyoming's police, James Maguffee.
"He is given the necessary treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
The judges often adapt so that this can be achieved."
Nolin's body was found on Thursday in a mobile house in the area "Creekside Estates".
Two children were shot with a single shot, and the police immediately identified Noline as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and gave a brief description of the man and his 1996 Dodge black pickup.
The man was noticed in his pickup and went to the US 131 motorway when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and his pickup hit the concrete wall, and he got out of the car and ran on the highway.
As a result, he shot at the police.
One policeman was in a SUV police car and drove Nolin from his back.
The observer has filmed an event.
Nolin was taken to the hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until he was extradited and transferred to Kent County prison.
“This event showed that Western Michigan police risk their health in order to protect the community,” said Maguffee.
"They got a man arrested quite quickly and by appropriate means, and we are very proud of them."
In total, Nolin has been charged with two charges of attack in order to kill him, he is also charged with fleeing the police, carrying a hidden weapon and a serious crime committed with the use of a firearm.
He's not yet accused of murdering her girl, because the investigation is still under way.
"Of course, we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will soon conclude in order to present in time to the Prosecutor of Kent County," said Maguffee.
The judge praised a courageous man who smashed his teeth into his house to an intruder.
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for the courage of a man who stood before two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one hacker tried to drive him a wooden board, in 63 C.E. David Oldham was not afraid.
A man who worked as an overseer of the university territory defended, struck both criminals, and beat their teeth.
The invaders fled, but after the battle on Mr. Oldham left blood, which after four months was found and arrested by Craig Ford.
In his sentence to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to get into the house of 400 000 pounds worth of oldham in Ormskerke, Lancashire, King Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t expect such a reaction of Mr. Oldham – when you overshadowed your eyes and nose to see him only, you encountered him at the house, he hit you.
He also struck your associate, who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
After being sentenced to three years and four months in prison on Friday, the judge said: “I hope you learned two lessons.
First, you don't have to irritate David Oldham, and second, you don't want to start with the police.
For your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you bit a dog.
It's still a minor punishment."
He added, "I want to praise Mr. Oldham for his response to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford, who committed the crime, had already been sentenced to another hack in 2016 and had to be held in prison for three years, but was released on parole.
Mr Oldham claimed to the Liverpool Royal Court that he jumped when he heard a noise at home about 19.00 on 5 April.
Jones said: “Mr. Oldham, who is a rich man, courageously left the house and resisted to the accused.
Fearing for his own safety, he struck him in his face, striking him and smashing his tooth.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit him in his face."
According to Mr. Jones, the associate took a wooden board and tried to sniff Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Call him, he beat my teeth."
He said to Mr. Oldham, "If you let us go, we will leave," and, along with Ford, he fled from the scene of the crime.
On August 2, the police caught Ford at the house in Wavertree.
Ford kicked the police dog, and he bit him in his shoulder.
It is believed that the second hacker is still free.
Ford, a 25-year-old who has no permanent place of residence, admitted to be guilty of hacking, falling and dangerous driving, although he is banned and does not hold a driving licence.
Tori activists met the criticism expressed to Johnson with a wide-ranging audience
Tori activists today humiliated Boris Johnson when he was called "a small and aggressive man".
Mr. Johnson, who tried to please ordinary people in his uncompromising speeches about Brexita, received a strong evaluation from the former Minister of Trade, Digby Jones, which was also endorsed this afternoon by the participants of the Birmingham Conference.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he cares about newspaper headlines and not about strong politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr May's ally in the Cabinet added that he simply "noise" because he was unable to be a full leader.
The opposite reaction came when the former Foreign Secretary once again attacked the Prime Minister's Chequers plan and called it "insane" and "absolutely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and here she did not agree with the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May denied that its critics played political games and claimed that they were not bluffing and prepared to negotiate hard with the EU.
In an interview at Andrew Marro BBC, which opened the Conference of the Pastors, Mr. May said: "I believe in Brexit.
The former Labour Minister of Trade Lord Jones, now independent, received the approval of the crowd in his praise of Brexito's prospects.
People were flattered when he expressed his opinion on Mr. Johnson, who supposedly answered the questions of concerned businessmen.
Without giving a specific name to Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones has made it clear that he is a "little and aggressive man".
"Business is very important, therefore, by saying "deep business", the former Foreign Secretary showed that it is actually a small and aggressive man," he said.
"I completely disagree with him."
Lord Jones also praised his speech at the meeting of the leaders of Salzburg who watched Mr May's speech in the Chamber and heard the EU leaders' "trailer" to its office plan.
The leader of the Scottish industry, Ruth Davidson, also criticised Mr. Johnson in the past, reminding him that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexito negotiations.
The Ally of May in the Cabinet of Ministers said to the paper MailOnline that intervention is not very serious and Mr. Johnson has not enough supporters among the Members of Parliament to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He noises, but he does not have enough supporters in the parliamentary party, and he knows it himself.
We see a clear contrast between David Davis, who respected his opinion, and Boris, who met his personal ambitions."
Business secretary Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked entrepreneurs who were sceptical about Brexita.
Speaking at the Factor Conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson was "absolutely wrong".
He said: “I’m surprised that someone can think like that at all.
There is no successful economy in the world without successful businesses."
In an interview with Sky News, "Ridge on Sunday", Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months would not be easy because the EU will try to make the United Kingdom grant many reliefs.
He believes, however, that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian Treaty, not as the Cabinet of Ministers has suggested.
When asked how Mr. Johnson succeeded in leading the committees, he did not miss the opportunity to envy the former Foreign Secretary.
Describing Mr. Johnson's proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the defects of British policy is a fantastic policy."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of its ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politicians."
Bulgaria spends £80 million on poor recovery of European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on European taxpayers' money on the poor restoration of ancient castles, which now seem to be built from "cheese and cardboard".
The Balkan country spent £80 million on the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the former majesty, the restoration gained a sense of covetousness.
The local authorities near Krakra have promised to redesign unbelieving works.
The Bulgarian government has spent dozens of EU millions of unscientificly on the restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan country spent £80 million on restoration of ancient castles and fortifications from the European Regional Development Fund, but instead of returning their former majesty, they received a passion for construction works.
Relics after a costly reconstruction seem to be built from the "cheese and cardboard" so that it is no longer attractive for tourists.
For example, the conservationists were impressed that the Fortress Krakra and the Roman Fort Trayanov Vrata, near Ihtiman, were reconstructed using polymer concrete, most often used to build the floor.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have agreed in private that this failure needs to be learned.
"Stella Duleva, an architect and monumentist about Trayanovi Vrata, is in a cavalry state," said the architect and monumentist.
It has survived for 16 centuries and is now damaged."
This reaction occurred after the restoration of Krakra fort in Pernik, which is why the local government promised to remove the parts that had been delivered in 2019.
The Pernik Fortress is freed from “drop out of cardboard” due to its false modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata Fort has been mentioned as a "sorry fortress" because it has been rebuilt from smooth white blocks that are not suitable for the facade affected by weather conditions.
This failed effort coincides with the new doubts about how the European Union is using the development funds.
A crowd of stylistic bikers on their way to this year's event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of stylish costumers from all over the United Kingdom made their way to the streets on amber motorcycles in order to raise money for the Movember fund.
The event is known as the "Miscellaneous gentleman's journey" and is organised every year to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year, the bikers are in London and 40 other UK locations, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's events "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" take place in the UK and 650 other cities in the world and have so far managed to collect more than £5.5 million (4.2 million).
According to the official website of the event, in this year's event, 120 000 people "traped their necks, tie their ties, smoothed their tweezers, sat on their classic and amber-style motorcycles and allowed them to raise funds and raise awareness about men's health, in particular prostate cancer and mental well-being".
The event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" in Sydney, Australia was organized for the first time by Mark Hawkes.
The idea was inspired by a photo by Don Draper, a character of the "Mad Men" series, where he sits on a classic motorcycle in his best line.
This year, hundreds of bikers, including an arrogant tax dog, Sergeant Pipe, traveled along the Tower Bridge in London.
Tennis sharp Boris Becker revealed his cure for skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker's photos have barely seen a small patch in front of sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
After discovering that he was treated for skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Becker was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday he published a Twitter message on his health: "I want to thank Martin Mayr-Brune and Dr Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
On Sunday, 50-year-old photos have barely seen a small patch near the sunglasses.
"On Monday, I visited a dermatologist who removed basic cell carcinoma from me," said Becker to German publication Image.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is."
Basic cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
In time, there is a high chance of recovery.
Becker is currently different with his wife Lilly Becker (42), and they reported divorce in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and the Olympic gold medal at the Two-Sixth Race.
He's just been seen enjoying fun with his friends in 185 Oktoberfest in Munich.
Due to body volumes, the 24-year-old hammer hit the unknown train platform.
On the train platform, British atlas, who was attacked by a stranger because of body volumes, decided not to remain silent.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal at this year's British Athletic Championship, says he was attacked Friday afternoon at Lids Station.
In 24 C.E. and five feet 11 inches tall, Mr. Mayho said that while waiting for the train, she was pushed and insulted by a man.
About 5 p.m., an attacker named it a "star" on a platform.
However, the rising sports star, who sought place in the British team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has turned out to be a man.
Mr. Mayh, who came from the western Yorkshire town of Kitley, said: “I would defend myself until other people turned their eyes on a full platform.
Such people may be frightened and forced to distrust themselves, but it is the body of the MY, MY 'mechanism'.
After publishing her adventure on Twitter, the young atlas received great support in social media.
Andy Lewis, cavalier of the MBE Order, wrote: “Stra!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jessie, you're okay.
Don't let a naughty idiot spoil your mood."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm disgusting.
Not only because of him, but also because of those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You are an example for the new generation.
You showed that you should be proud of yourself, and you could get dissatisfied!"
Lids University, working at Mr. Mayho, had an interest in teen years and encouraged coaches from one of her older sisters.
Since then, she has been able to win second place at the Muller British Seniors Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the medal of the British Championship just a month after she won the UK Games.
Atletė refused to comment more on the event.
When accounts of at least 50 million users are broken, Facebook will pay a fine of £1.25 billion
Using the security gap, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, large-scale hacking was reported only after three days – on Friday.
Now Facebook is threatened with a huge fine under new European data laws
After at least 50 million accounts have been broken, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
Criminals could have access to accounts due to a security gap and could have disclosed a lot of sensitive personal information.
However, Facebook only reported the hacking on Friday, three days later, and it could not be said until yesterday evening how many British accounts were broken.
As long as the search for apps continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of the web giant with European data compliance requirements, has criticised the company: "The notification is incomplete."
Facebook is at risk of a huge fine under the new data laws of the European Union because businesses can be required to pay up to four percent of world turnover.
Last year Facebook earned 31.2 billion of income.
Criminals have reached accounts using the Facebook function "View As" to give users the opportunity to see how their profiles look like others.

In the MG Baltic case, records are still being heard: defendants discussed Gabriele Landsberg
The hearing started with a hearing between the former vice-president of MG Baltic Raimonds Kurlanskis and the former "worker" Vytautas Gapšis.
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what people are talking about at the moment.
True, the record hears that Mr Kurlanskis and Mr Gapšys are talking about Christmas, that the name of the current Conservative leader Gabriele Landsbergis sounds several times, but what exactly is said is difficult to understand.
Indictments against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, the accusations were submitted to three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberals Movement parties, MG Baltic Group, E. Masiulis, former leaders of liberals and "workers", Vytautas Gapšis, former liberalist Š. Gustainis, Member of the Seimas G. Steponavičius, and R. Kurlanskis, former vice-president of MG Baltic.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade effects, the Liberals Movement is suspected of bribery, trading influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and trading these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians started or discussed bribes with the then vice-president of MG Baltic R. Kurlanski, and later proposed or supported group-friendly initiatives in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former Chairman of the Liberals Movement E. Masiulis is suspected of the influence of trade, bribery and illegal enrichment, suspicions of abuse by former Deputy Chairman of this Party G. Steponavičius, former member of Vilnius City Council Š. Gustainis - bribery.
Mr Gapšys is suspected of having a bribery and an effect on trade, Mr Kurlanskis is suspected of having a bribery and an effect on trade.
Survey: Who has the greatest chance to win the second round of presidential elections?
Four candidates at the top of the ratings were included in the survey on the second round: economist Gitanas Nauseda, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, who had not announced the candidate, and two candidates who participated in the initial elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party – Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
It is true that on Sunday it became clear that I. Šimonytė received support from TS-LKD in the elections, and V. Ušackas withdrew from the electoral struggle.
As the figures show, in all cases, the second round of the President would win Mr Nauseda, but the president of Vilnius, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Separate (of others - DELFI) Nauseda, but it's very important to see whether about parties talking, or about people, what the dynamics are.
These doubles of Shimonytė ranged from one study to the other, and Nauseda had stopped growing, and Ushack even decreased.
This growth is very important for you", says the sociologist.
Moreover, looking at the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think not to go to the elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis compete in the second round of the presidential election, the fight would be tense - 32.7% for Šimonytė, 30.9% for S. Skvernelis.
True, even 36.4% of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who they would vote or would not vote in the elections.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that we have not yet seen a full picture, because all candidates who would apply to a less successful Lithuanian elite have not yet been announced.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the candidate for social democrats? 30 years was a candidate, won't it?
When he announces himself, he will see how his chances with other candidates are at stake.
So the Lithuanian side, which is less successful, is so far less reflected," V. Gaidys said.
In turn, political scientist of Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU IDMI) Mažvydas Jastramskis says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected V. Ušacka, who has withdrawn from the fight, seem relatively.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not necessarily reflect the advantage of any of the candidates.
The only thing I could see is that Nauseda would look good against Ushack (...) again, bearing in mind that these people would come to vote in real terms.
It looks good to eat against the Scovernelle, but we compare now apples and potatoes because, for example, Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, the Scovernelle has not announced.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the initial election of Conservatives, as it would look after them?" says the political scientist.
According to him, Mr Nauseda has a small plus, but once all the candidates have been declared, he may melt.
"The situation is quite equal.
Naussėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results in approximate terms.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential elections, Rolandas Paksas had 5% support to vote in favour of him and then won the elections.
It is impossible to make any predictions," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI reminds that economist G. Nauseda, Member of the Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of the Liberals Movement Petras Auštrevicius, Member of the Seimas Naglis Pueikis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis have already announced candidates in the presidential elections.
Iran charges Israel for attempted cyber attack
"The history of the use of cyber weapons is clear from such cases as the (computeric virus) Stuxnet (dissemination), this time trying to violate Iran's communication infrastructure," the Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azari Jahromi wrote through Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by the Stuxnet virus in 2010, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that this harmful programme was developed by Israel and the United States.
"For our technical team's alert, they're empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international fora," stressed Mr J.A. Jachromei.
Deputy Minister Hadid Fattahi said that the technical team had recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems on Monday morning, but the attackers were given a strong response.
In the wellness club Imuls, a man got sick, he couldn't be revived
It was about 10.40.
A man who sailed in a swimming pool (born 1945) suddenly got sick and immersed in water.
The man was quickly taken out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
Trying to refresh him.
Soon after the ambulance, health - care professionals also tried to revitalize him, but he was not able to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in an ambulance.
This disaster was commented by Antanas Sakalauskas, the head of the Health Club Network Imuls.
"We say that a 73-year-old man went to our wellness club on Monday morning with his wife, Fabijoniškių str.
The pool client sailed for about 30 minutes, then ran to the pool tracks for rest, and in a few minutes he suddenly collapsed.
People nearby - a client who sailed on a common path and a pool supervisor - reacted immediately, pulled it out of the water and began to revitalize.
The man was constantly revitalized until the ambulance arrived.
The club staff immediately called for emergency medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
Upon arrival, the doctors restored the man’s heart and breathing and moved him into the medical car.
As we went to the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilise the man’s health, but after 20 minutes, we received information that the man had failed.
We express our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased man for his loss.
Preliminary data suggest that the event may have been due to the health problems of the client.
According to the information provided by the family medical staff, he had diabetes mellitus.
We recall that in the face of serious health problems, it is always very important to make a responsible assessment of our opportunities and to consult with doctors and health club professionals.
All health clubs in the pool have a watch-keeping supervisor, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and it distinguishes from other employees by its bright clothing.
Such pool managers shall have radio stations capable of promptly communicating with the administration and the reception facility, answering their requests or calling for assistance.
The training of staff relating to the security programme is carried out four times a year - much more frequently than is required by law.
During their work, employees develop theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to deal with accidents, monitor their proper compliance with procedures and internal procedures.
Portugal’s Radically Solving Heroin Problem
In the 1990s, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Almost every Portuguese knew someone who would have suffered from this deadly drug.
Now, just a couple of decades later, the country is proud of one of the lowest drug-related mortality rates in the world.
In Norway, the son of Gražina had lost his son; he replaced four families and stopped speaking Lithuanian
According to the LNK press release, four years ago the Lithuanian lost the right to care for the son and it was seen with the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the courts.
The story of the woman has caused almost an international scandal that the entire media has followed.
The compatriots prepared pikes for his grandmother’s return to Lithuania both in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity to the Greeks and her family has not helped to restore the son of Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, she has been separated from her son for the past few years, as well as her meetings with her child two years later.
At the time when Gražina lost her right to care for her son, the boy was 8 years old, today at the beginning of the 12th teens.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw a son, which was banned.
Later, the boy was given the right to see him twice a year, in just one hour.
During the last court hearing, which took place several months ago, the number of dates for the Lithuanian was increased to three times per year and extended to two hours.
The meetings with the son remind us every time we meet in a prison with strict shredding - monitored by officials, and going to them - a secret operation.
"The Sons changed even four families and no longer speak in Lithuanian," the heart this Tuesday evening will be opened by Gražina, her story - in LNK's show
Eligius Masiulis will not return his personal money from the search
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced that it had rejected the complaint of the accused lawyer.
The order shall be final and not subject to appeal.
In the case of political corruption, E. Masiulis, former Head of the Liberals Movement, applied to the Appeals Court for the refund of any personal money - money taken through search - from him and the spouses' wallets.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Masiulis during the search.
These money is subject to a temporary restriction on ownership and is constantly renewed.
The last time Vilnius Regional Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Masiulis has not asked the Appeal Court to refund all money - he is seeking to recover EUR 800 from the spouse's wallet and his wallet EUR 690, GBP 130, USD 1600.
The former politician says that the latter money was allocated to the US for a planned trip.
M. Masiulis, lawyer at the Court of Appeals, asked for this money to be repaid on Monday, because the spouses had well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such sums.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius requested the court to reject the complaint.
"The decision of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and justified, there is no restriction on the more assets indicated in the charges submitted.
The court correctly stated that it lays the foundations for confiscation of property, as well as for extended confiscation of property," J. Lacius said during the court hearing.
On October 15 Vilnius Regional Court decided not to repay more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in the case of political corruption E. Masiulis.
This money has been found through the search for accusations of corruption in the former politician's home and in the car.
The Chamber of three judges stated that it is clear from the file that ownership rights are restricted only to funds that constitute the subject matter of criminal offences committed against E. Masiulis.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it should be concluded that the right of ownership of the accused is not subject to a disproportionate restriction or a restriction for too long," the judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Ugnius Trumpulis stated in the ruling.
The judges pointed out that Mr Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, that criminal proceedings were large and complex, and that therefore, in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property, it was necessary to extend the time limit of the defendant’s temporary restriction of property.
Prosecutors state that Raimondas Kurlanskis, former vice-president of MG Baltic concern, gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiulis for taking decisions useful to the concern in the Seimas.
Both accused believe that the money found with E. Masiulis - EUR 90 thousand - was a loan from R. Kurlanskis.
According to the case, 242.4 thousand euros, 130 pounds of UK pounds and 1.6 thousand dollars were found in search of E. Masilis.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
A former politician has said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are family money.
He also argued that there was no evidence of criminalisation of the funds.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has announced that it is clear from the accusations made to Mr Masiulis that these funds could have been received by accepting a bribe of more than EUR 100 000.
Legal protection claims that the remaining cash taken through search could have been received from unidentified sources of income, undeclared, undocumented and possibly not legal income.
In the case of political corruption, the accusations were submitted to three legal entities - Labour Party, Liberals Movement, MG Baltic concern.
In addition to E. Masiulis, the accusations were submitted to the former "worker" Vytautas Gapšis, the former parliamentarian liberal Šarūnas Gustainis, the Member of the Seimas Gintars Steponavičius and the former vice-president of MG Baltic R. Kurlanskis.
Kurlanskis is accused of giving bribes to former parliamentarians E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainis and V. Gapsius.
The Americans have recorded dangerous Russian destroyer maneuvers
At the time of the 25-minute takeover, the U.S. Navy said that Russian SU-27 hurried straight through the plane ahead.
The Russian aircraft ran through it for the second time, using the acceleration of gravity, and took a turn with the turn.
Passengers reported the feeling of turbulence during the first approach and quake during the second approach.
Russian troops have the right to exercise in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are in line with behaviour, including the 1972 INCSEA Agreement, - said the US Navy in its report.
'Insecure action increases the risk of miscalculation and potential collisions,' notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognised the incident, but assured that Russian SU-27 had a safe distance from an American plane.
Parental costs do not fall further: only €50 per month is allocated for extracurricular activities
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Research", a survey conducted at the end of August revealed that one third (32 percent) of parents gave less than 100 euros for buying their children of one school age before school this year, one fifth (21 percent) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three out of ten (29 percent) - between 151 and 200 euros, and a little less than one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros on preparing one of their children for school at the end of the summer.
Parents whose children started to go to the first class in this school year spent an average of approximately 220 euros on their child's school basket, while other parents, whose children have already completed the first class, gave a smaller amount of about 160 euros on average for the preparation of their child.
However, there is no reduction in spending as the school year grows, as parents often have to spread their wallet to children's groups and co-petitors.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of one unit may vary from 20 to 100 euros per country.
Parents who have school - age children were asked to state the average monthly amount they plan to spend on the extracurricular employment of their one child.
A quarter (23 per cent) of the surveyed children planned to receive up to 20 euros per month, another quarter (26 per cent) said they had studied up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31 per cent) of the surveyed children allocate between 50 and 100 euros per month, while a sixth (17 per cent) parents indicated that they plan to allocate 100 euros or more.
It is true that in Lithuania, children of school age are assigned an informal children education basket, which amounts to 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one group, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the parents have to cover the difference.
If a child attends several classes or has several school - age children in the family, expenditure on post-school activities may double.
Justina Ambrasienė, marketing manager of consumer loan company "Vivus.lt", saving children's groups on low or middle income families, especially when several children are growing up in the family, can become a great challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents turned their heads to get money for exercises, stationery, or new sports clothes.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a lot of money.
We note that parents’ costs are particularly high in August when it comes to preparing properly for a new school year, but they are still higher later than in the summer period, as parents tend to invest in their children’s employment.
Often, when they lack funds and value their opportunities responsibly, they are determined to borrow," says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunass are pleased by the fourth printed trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition "Attenu senu naujienos, good news" of the mobile street has been opened - the old trolleybus, which has been dubbed with a drawing and the inscription "Sienografas inks" has been dubbed.
A new fun trolleybus was announced by Kaunas City Municipality.

Less than a week after the first show on Kaunas streets, the second piece of street artist Timothy Norvila - Morfai.
The trolleybus depicts a funny yellow car, which is often referred to as just a "bottle".
"I wanted to put the trolleybus in.
This drawing looks very funny, especially because it meets also the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn on the turn, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them like a retro-style, it sounded like a whole combination.
Until the trolleybus tires were painted, it certainly wasn't so beautifully look," – the street artist spoke to the portal Kaunas.diena.lt earlier.
And on October 27, when the painting was installed, it lay down on the third trolleybus.
It is printed with white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly with blue paint.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is shown one house of K.Donelaitis Street, and on the right - central post.
"Wabal" to me for the time being, "Morphy did the third trolleybus printing artist Morph.
Buy New
Kauno diena reminds that last week Kaunas public transport company Kauno busi and Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A signed a 29.4 million agreement, which indicates that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
"The Kaunas has invested the largest amount in its history for the renewal of public transport.
This agreement will allow us to replace the old "Skoda" brand trolleybuses that have served all of us for many years and offer passengers the most comfortable services.
New low-flooring modern trolleybuses will have more seating positions, effective cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New machinery and parallel network renewal and street repair work will allow the trolleybus to travel more reliably, much faster.
And, of course, the trolleybuses of modern design greatly decorate the city," said Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of Kauno busi.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas Sense: Queen Elizabeth II invited the mother of M. Markle to celebrate together
Duke Meghan has hit the British royal palace.
This is proved by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: British Monarchy invited Saxon’s mother, Dory Ragnand, and the British media to Christmas in her House of Sandrigama.
Even the parents of Duchess Kate have not received such honor.
Kate’s parents, Carole, Michael Middleton, and other members of her family have so far been invited to the traditional Christmas services with their royal family.
The unnamed source for the newspaper Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Dorija Raglabd is a sign of "the honour of the Queen Meghan".
Doria was at the royal wedding in May, and she was hit by her "peace."
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together also encouraged speeches that Mr. Ragland is planning a longer stay in Great Britain.
It is presumed that she wants to help her daughter before and after childbirth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born a firstborn in the spring of 2019.
The exhibition "Women's World" will recede in the "Zalgiris" Arena
As autumn routine and more significant weather, the 16th exhibition "Women's World" has already been held, making women wait for the long weekend, because even four days of hottest news of fashion, style and beauty are already on 8-11 November in Kaunas "Žalgiris" Arena.
Over the course of the year, we can see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means to give time to yourself rather than ordinary shopping.
Often it becomes a meeting place for friends and reason to spend the day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of the exhibition has a special power - every woman here can learn charming secrets, learn tricks, how to look bright every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or try various procedures that stop the skin aging process.
All this is more than 415 participants, who will be waiting on all three floors of the arena.
The seminars on beauty and health will take place for three days, and on Sunday the representatives of the beautiful sex will be able to hear the advice to create an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and blogger Victoria Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women who turn up in business are confronted with marginal situations when stress starts to hamper stable emotional and physical conditions.
For this reason, the Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the business women's network operating there were born the idea to organise a conference "Business and happy. Without stress", where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, I have a lot of events for beauty masters.
The long-term partners of the exhibition, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Professionals, will provide an opportunity to learn for two days the subtleties of hair painting and modelling from the charismatic duet created by the international Academy "Vinokurov & friends" - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
A contest for the creation of the bride's performance and the skill fight "Art Battle", which will not leave indifferent, will be waiting for further improvement.
Like a cherry on the cake will become a fiesta "With birthday, Lithuania" for the representatives of the world of beauty, where an unseen show – from body painting to dance – can be seen for centuries.
Another tradition of "Women's World" will not be forgotten – presentations of the latest collections of designers on Friday's Fashion and Beauty Show, where you will choose the most stylish.
The handicraft supporters will be welcome at Dekostudija's workshop, where you can create original products for home interior or more interesting decoration of gifts.
On the last day of the exhibition, all the longest ones are especially welcome, because traditionally the competition "LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018" will delight visitors, where new records of the longest cash register are recorded every year.
Prime Minister: teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after the introduction of a basic payment
Since the introduction of the ethical pay model from September, the average salaries of teachers of the country with full workload increased by 117 euros, confirmed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It's too early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who are under full-time work - their salaries grew by more than 117 euros on average," said Skvernelis to journalists on Monday in the Government.
He called the Lithuanian Association of Education Workers (VETS) plans to implement a strike on ethical payment "democratic right", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permitted, possible.
If it is thought that we need to strike, it is their right of self-determination.
You wouldn't want children, schoolchildren, to suffer in this place again.
If the strike is to be done, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force," said Mr Skvernelis.
In June, the Seimas approved a model of ethical teachers' pay, which is introduced in stages from September.
The teacher’s education was replaced by hourly pay – the teacher’s job is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
The trade union led by Andrius Navickas describes this reform as absurd, annoying that it was adopted by the 'buldozer' principle and declaring an indefinite strike starting on 12 November.
The GPS requires the immediate withdrawal of this "minus" wage system and the introduction of an ethical model with a minimum of 18 contact hours per post.
Also - to increase the coefficients of the fixed part of the basic salary by 20% and to reduce the number of children in classes.
Among other things, there is criticism of the introduction of a new methodology for allocating training funds, because trade unions say that there is not enough money for home training, classes to be divided into groups, qualifications, education aid, and classes in large cities as they have remained overcrowded.
The Ministry of Education and Science has stated that the ethical pay for teachers will allow adjustment of teachers' workload and compensation for all work for the school community.
It is foreseen that the teaching staff will be able to work for the community up to half of the total number of hours per year, and for the first two years up to 40% of the total number of hours.
Teachers’ working time is set at 36 hours per week, of which no more than 24 contact points per week for compulsory subject(s) training.
In May, about half a hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the LithuaniaS, about 1 thousand teachers.
In total, there are about 53 000 teachers in Lithuania.
Invites to be ready: the crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
The economic growth slowdown and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, the "Business position" of the news radio programs said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
'To say that the crisis is already behind the corner, I could certainly not, but there are signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning to grow by 2.8 percent.
The main message I would like to give to society and business - let us be ready for everything," V. Vasiliauskas said.
He felt that there were no uniform crises, and that there was a need for them to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis that occurred a decade ago was that the government at that time thought that the revenue generated by the growing economy would be everlasting, and that was what the planned expenditure was.
This led to very drastic cuts in expenditure in 2008 following the crisis.
Now, according to Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"In fact, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already beyond our potential and we need to press on the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania said.
V. Vasiliauskas evaluates the preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis by 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, the small and open economy, like Lithuania, is heavily affected by external factors.
The current move of the great elephants - the US, China and the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us as well.
We therefore need to be very careful.
In the case of little economy to say that we are dealing with everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," V. Vasiliauskas said.
What can we expect in the future for those who have taken up large loans?
According to Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly put in place a short-term strategy, and interest decisions can be expected not before the summer of next year: 'At present, the main objective is to try to manage expectations'.
The trend, which is most worrying to the Head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the drop in labour hands in our country.
"The drop in labour hands is also, to a large extent, leading to a decrease in the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a decline in bread eaters.
Migration this year has allowed a little balance to be made in this process, but it does not know whether this is a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance forecast that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year and next year - 2.8 percent.
Swedish Conservative leader will try again to form a government
Sweden, which has been at a political impasse for two months after the elections, will receive a second chance to form a government, announced by the Speaker of Parliament on Monday.
The moderate party of Ulfo Kristersson belongs to the Alliance of four centre-right parties, which received slightly less votes during the 9th September elections than the previous ruling coalition of the centre-left.
It was difficult for both blocks to bring the majority together by refusing to negotiate with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origins are in the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by Mr Kristersson to form the government on 14 October was a failure.
On October 29, Stefan Lofven, Prime Minister of the end of his term of office, announced his failed attempt.
In an attempt to force parties to reach an agreement, the President of Parliament, Andreas Norlenas, said that he would propose to Parliament next week Mr Kristersson, as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thus pushing the first vote since the beginning of the government building effort.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as Prime Minister," said A. Norlenas.
He stressed, however, that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change'.
"The negotiations must end without pay," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is still unclear, but Mr Norlen said that there is 14 November among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of the Parliament may instruct a candidate four times to form a government with which Parliament would agree.
If all four attempts fail, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third attempt by Mr Norlen.
Some moderate party and Alliance's partners are forcing Mr Kristersson to accept the support of the extreme right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has yet to reject this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores all main current parties for a long time.
The ultra-rights party, which successfully used the voter's anger in terms of immigration during the elections, after almost 400 000 asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2012, demands influence in the decision-making process in exchange for support.
However, the Liberals and Centralists of the Alliance strongly oppose this idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) with the support of the Greens and non-formal lefts has provided opportunities for cooperation between the blocks, but only if it maintains its position as Prime Minister.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this possibility.
A delegation from the Afghan Government will participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul Government delegation will take part in the international peace talks in Russia this month, and officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban in turn is still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it will hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on 17-year end.
The Afghan Government's High Peace Council, which is responsible for efforts at reconciliation with fighters, will send four representatives to Moscow, said Sayid Ihsan Taher to the news agency AFP.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has avoided the sending of a delegation to this conference, which will focus on the initiation of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials - said representative of Sebagtula Ahmadi. - We welcome any peace efforts conducted by Afghans.
Place of birth: (a) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (b) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (c) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (d) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (e) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (e) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (f) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (g) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (h) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (h
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, long-time indicted support to the Taliban of Afghanistan, "needed to participate", said the AFP representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muhammad Faisal.
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request for comment.
The first meeting in Moscow was scheduled for September, but was postponed on Kabul's request to be led by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place at an early stage.
The newly appointed US Peace Envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is trying to convince the Taliban to negotiate the end of the war and is concerned that the multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine these efforts.
One US government supervisory authority indicated last week that the government of Kabul in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba met with North Korea's leader in Pyongyang
North Korea's leader Kim Chen Unas and Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel, both of whom hope to lift US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen strategic relations between their countries, and reported on Monday to the North Korean state media.
Diaz-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after coming to power in April, came to Pyongyang and his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong Unas met him at the airport, and the leaders entered the city through the crowds they welcomed.
North Korea's state media reported that the leaders held talks at the state guest house Paekhwawon, stressed the overall socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail, but indicated that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
A meeting with Kim Jong Una could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to make significant progress on the issue of North Korea's denuclearisation are becoming increasingly urgent.
Pyongyang, who has recently also sought Moscow's favor with covetousness, tightens his rhetoric before this week's planned meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's main negotiator Kim Yong Cholo in New York.
Over the weekend, Pyongyang criticised the United States, through his official media, for its irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea mentioned the possibility of further development of the nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change course.
Sanctions are an important item on Mr Diaz-Canel's agenda.
Last week, when visiting Moscow, Diaz-Canelis discussed the arms contract with Russia worth almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
Both Presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'interruption into the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains in force.
Russia's painful sanctions against the US and the European Union have been imposed due to the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diaz-Canel has to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He's going to China, Vietnam and Laos.
Cars insecure at storage sites?
On Saturday, she asked the police to investigate this fraud.
According to the Klaipėda woman, in 2006 the car of the "Hyundai Santa Fe" brand was left for storage in the parking lot at the end of September.
She noticed the publication on the website on 3 November.
The fraudsters tried to sell her vehicle for EUR 3800.
According to the wife, the car could have been stolen.
The vehicle was sold by a man born in 1989.
According to the police, the person is not the owner of the site.
An investigation shall be conducted to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
On Sunday evening, about 22: 00 a.m., fire broke out on the 7th floor of the multi-apartment building.
There was a fire in one room's apartment, and there was waste and sofa parking in the room.
The apartment was taken by the owner and examined by medical staff, reported by the police.
Burning and sanding objects are thrown out of the apartment through the window.
During the fire, the 7th floor of the stairwell began to smoke.
Record: Athletic in 157 days sailed Britain
On Sunday, British atlas landed from the sea to England, becoming the first man to visit Great Britain along the coast.
The 33 - year - old Ross Edgley, Ross Egel, spent 157 days in the water and over 2,883 miles [2,83 km].
He sailed for six hours, and he spent the night on a support team ship that accompanied him.
Over the last mile, the sportsman was overcome by hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He landed in Margateite, in south-eastern England, this is where Edgley started his journey on 1 June.
The sportsman, who planned to keep time for 100 days, said to those who met him on the shore, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that he first felt relief when he went to the shore.
"I was very worried that my legs would not withstand it," said the athletes.
The association of the world's open-water sailing indicated that during this endurance test, supported by the producer of the energy drinks Red Bull, Ms Edgley had to face exceptionally difficult weather conditions on several occasions, and that jellyfish even had to be stunned 37 times.
The organisers declare that Mr Edgley has doubled the record of the longest sea-breaking voyage, which until now was 73 days.
He also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southern and northernmost points of Great Britain - the Lands End Point and John O'Grouts.
This distance was over 62 days.
The Secret of the Kleboniškis Forest: one suspect has already been detained
It was a raging finding of the passer-by, because the murderer was badly buried.
Only in these circumstances was the crime discovered, since the victim of murderers had no relatives and his disappearance was not reported.
According to preliminary data, he was not too old to be a full - time adult.
Like his suspects.
One of them was arrested by Kaunas District Court last week for three months.
The second, who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is hiding his sentence for another crime, is still being searched for.
Until it is found, law enforcement officers are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many things for my children
In the new rock opera Love and Death in Verona, the ranks of the country's most prominent performers are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the artist's team, entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a woman of course will play Juliet's babysitter.
Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the singing of artists, has also become an important part of the team.
"I think that love stories have been created many and very beautiful since Shakespeare's time, but Romeo and Juliet will probably always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built on different scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of such buildings," I. Valinskienė says about the new test that has come down on my shoulders.
Although a known woman is well-known on the stage, has created a number of roles in various performances or musicals, the crèches have not been able to play her.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," I. Valinskienė smiles.
- I'd probably be happy to accept that offer too."
True, babysitter's character in the drama of V. Shakespeare is no less important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
It is not only a mediator, a helper - its way and tone of speaking, a woman's attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives more and different colours to the story.
Besides, she's important because she's one of just two women in the drama Romeo and Juliet.
"The fruit character for my way and style is not very close, but sometimes it's only more interesting.
To create a different character than you have – a fun part of the creative process.
So far, I do not know what the final result will be, because this will depend not only on me but also on the director's interpretation," says I. Valinskienė and reveals that being a babysitter of Juliet would probably do the same.
- I think the baby girl asked her heart.
That's what most women do.
I'd probably do that too."
The legendary Kęstutis Antanelis rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is designed according to the famous drama "Romeo and Juliet" by V. Shakespeare.
A work based on real facts tells a tragic story of the love of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of history is determined by the uncertainty of where the conflict between the families of young people - the Monteks and the Capulettes.
"All kinds of stories are possible at all times.
Parents who opposed the choice of children have always been and will be.
Only today's solutions to such problems - more diverse, - were asked if Romeo and Juliet's history could happen again today, says the future baby girl I. Valinskienė.
- I'd make a lot of peace with my kids in my name, as well as with my daughter. "
The main roles of the actor and director Ramūnas Cicėnas will be performed by Ieva Zasimuskaitė and Justinas Jarutis, and Vidas Barkūkis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Pamaisis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest rock opera Love and Death in Verona will be presented to the audience by the end of December.
On December 28, the first legendary work, which will be performed in new colours, will be seen by the viewers of Vilnius Siemens Arena.
The day later, on December 29, rock opera will be shown on Klaipeda "Švyturys" Arena.

However, later on, the promising career of the footballer was stopped by trauma.
After a two-year break, Mark Benethet, another representative of Kauno Žalgiris, received an invitation to the team.
Egidijus Vaitkūnas and Edvinas Girdvainis, defenders who spent in October with Romania and Montenegro, return to the match due to injuries in the League of Nations.

At home, both Serbs and Romanians lost a minimal difference.
And there's no luck.
We hope that the guests will be able to respond.
Although this is a decisive fight for the first place in the group and an opportunity to continue the fight for the European Championship," said E.Jankauskas, the coach of the Lithuanian national team.

"Skamp" presents a song whose video has already refused to show one TV
The "Sampamp" group commemorated its 20th anniversary this year, and again intensively started to create music.
Having announced the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" taking place on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena, of course, three successive new works are presented.
This time it's Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow and a brave video of songs.
"This piece is about love, so I thought that every type of relationship, regardless of age or sexual orientation, should be captured in the video," Erica Jennings reveals the idea of a new song and video clip, which is convinced that any expression of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The video of the new song Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow has filmed over ten couples of different orientations and ages: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer need to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who created the music of his work at the beginning of the year on family holidays in Israel.
True, because of this video "Skamp" has already managed to get negative reactions - he did not want to show one of the most popular country broadcasts.
This tells us a lot about our society.
Television won't show you the clip, because it's where people kiss and it's not the wrong content for kids.
And the fact that at any time of the day the TV can be turned on on the fights on the screen and other forms of violence is the right content?" – retortically asks E. Jennings.
Erics antherin and Vilius Alessus: "We would like to see more people who are hand-held and kissing, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We are raising children and want them to grow up in an environment that is as tolerant as possible and that has as little sexual desire as possible.
We want a new song and video at least to clarify the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the Spamp group has been known for its bold texts, which speak on unpopular or sensitive topics.
The best songs of all groups - old and new - will sound loud and wide in the Skamp20 concert already on December 26 at Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It welcomes everyone with their families, and children under 10 years of age are free of charge.
At the Klinikai viaduct - traffic accident: the man who was driven by a bicycle was hit
A few minutes after 9 a.m. the portal Kaunas.diena.lt has reached readers' information about police and ambulance crews moving towards Kaunas clinics.
After an inquiry, the reasons for this uproar became clear.
The Kaunas police watchman confirmed to the portal that a traffic accident occurred near the Klinikai viaduct at the intersection of Utena and Aivenių Str.
There was a car and a cyclist.
According to a representative of Kaunas Medical Emergency Response, the person who was driven by a bicycle was hit during the accident.
Happily, serious injuries were avoided and open wounds were not seen on the body.
The victim's medical examination at the site of the accident.
Drivers report that this road section may be more difficult to pass due to an accident.
Presidency: LRT is not the property of politicians
When the Seimas intends to return to the discussion of the conclusions of the committee investigating activities of the LRT, the Presidency fears that the ruling parties simply seek to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," said the president's adviser, Mindaugas Linge.
However, the counselor pointed out that the opposite process could be seen at the moment.
"We can see that those (political. - ELTA) influence is wanted to have more.
We appreciate this quite critically," said Mr Linge.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission, which operates in the Seimas, are questionable and questionable legality, because it is peaceful to the independence of the broadcaster.
Although stressed by M. Linge, there is a need to improve LRT governance, this should be done on the basis of expert support and on the basis of specific aspects that hinder the smooth functioning of LRTs.
He stressed that already now the international institutions emphasize that the activities of the LRT should be supervised by the competent authorities rather than political institutions.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the committee which examined the activities of the LRT.
This conclusion has been a source of criticism.
The proposals to change the governance of the LRT have been very sceptical: to reduce the powers of the Council and to link the terms of office of its members with those of the appointing authorities.
In view of this, the European Broadcasting Union expressed its concern.
In January, the opposition group of Seimas Members addressed the Constitutional Court on whether the special parliamentary commission investigating activities and finances of the LRT was in contradiction with the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from R. Karbuskis
The Seimas started to consider an amendment to the Law on Declaration of Residence by Ramūnas Karbauskis, an elder of the Group of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union, whereby citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions.
After the submission of the draft on Tuesday was supported by 56 Seimas Members, before being 9, 25 Parliamentaries abstained.
After discussion in committees, the draft draft of the Seimas plenary session is planned to be discussed on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusion.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, states of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the Administration of the State Social Insurance Fund.
Resident and working outside Lithuania, according to the data provided and approved by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered to have left Lithuania.
This is about services that a person does not use.
There is an additional possibility to record the fact that a person has left," explained R. Karbuskis from the Seimas Tribunal.
Such proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservative of the Seimas Member, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Part of Lithuanians living abroad abuse it," noted A. Matulas.
Social democrat Algirdas Syss believes that in this way we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, it would allow wise people to use the health system free of charge.
Upon adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, persons who have gone to live in other countries shall be paid social insurance contributions there, debts will not accumulate and the burden of administration of the debts of Sodra will be eased.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Residents’ Register of departure are charged monthly with compulsory health insurance (CSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, a debt accumulates.
Duonėla has been convicted for fraud, but has been justified for counterfeiting
Vilnius Regional Court has maintained the sentence for attempting to defraud the convicted ex-spoken sportsman Alvydas Duonėla, but he has been justified for forgery of documents.
On Monday, the court’s trial came into effect immediately.
Duonėla has been sentenced to imprisonment for half a quarter of a year, postponing the execution of the sentence.
The multiple Lithuanian canoeing champion was sentenced to March this year by the Vilnius City District Court.
He was sentenced to half-four years in jail.
After examining the case according to the complaint of the sentenced person, Vilnius Regional Court eliminated one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
A former sportsman will also have to pay almost EUR 760 to the Crime Victim Fund.
The prosecutor's office A. Duonėla accused him of falsifying a note in 2013 by which he lent LTL 200 thousand (about EUR 58) to his former wife, Dalias Burokkaitė's office of dentistry.
The spouse only learned about this in December 2016, when she received calls for payment of the debt.
The former spouse said that she had never borrowed money from her husband for the purposes of the clinic and had never signed a bill of exchange.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, there are no objective data in the case proving that A. Duonėla would have recorded data that do not correspond to reality, that A. Duonėla owes LTL 200 thousand to UAB "Dalecija".
The arguments put forward in the complaint by the sentenced person and his or her defender are admissible, and there is no objective evidence to support this in the case.
Having thus established that Duonėla only used a false true document for fraud and admitted that this attribute - the use of a false document - is a constituent part of an attempt to fraud (in the case under consideration -), A. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proving that he was involved in committing a criminal act," says the Vilnius Regional Court ruling.
Firefighters led the cats buried in the land - they heard the bulge three days
As reported by the Kaunas County Fire Rescue Board, a report has been received that three days of cataclysming after the change of thermal pipelines has taken place.
When the firemen arrived, they also heard the cat snoring.
It was found that a few days ago, there were renovation works on the thermal track.
It is estimated that burial under the cover could have forced two cats to land.
Firefighters excavated a thermal route at a depth of one and a half meters and struck a space for cats to come out.
Son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father would not be surprised by liberal protests against Kavanaugh
On Sunday, the son of Velenis Supreme Court, Antonino Scalia, told the agency "Fox News" that his father would not be surprised by the protest of extreme forces against the nominated judge Britta Kavanaugh, because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too much involved in the affairs of the modern world.
“In general, he would not be surprised by the noise of the nomination to the Supreme Court, because many are based on the Roe v Wade case – at least the Left claims so,” said Christopher Scalia, reminding of the famous case of 1973, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established during certain trimesters.
In the Roe case, the right of all states to regulate abortions themselves and some states, in response to this decision, immediately attempted to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that in Roe v Wade and other cases the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with during the elections and the legislative process," he added during his performance at "Fox & Friends".
"In the interest of speeding up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has done even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes about approval give rise to a more severe reaction, because judges take up a role which belongs to the legislators."
The Nebraska Senator, Republican Ben Sasse, expressed a similar opinion at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, reiterating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are not, in principle, accountable to anyone, but leave the bureaucratic issues to be dealt with by the Supreme Court, so judges have to do work that is refused by the senators.
The Capitol Hill police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters of illegal interference in the approval process of a candidate.
When asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid a hostile reaction to the proven accusations of sexual misconduct he had committed several decades ago, Scalia claimed that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to the statements that Kavanaugh should not hold office in the Supreme Court, because on Thursday, during a survey of senators, the reaction was hot and sometimes insane, Scalia questioned whether all judges were a calm character.
"The judges are often angry," Scalia said when she spoke about the angry differences that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
“It is true that Judge Kavanaugh may have reacted more aggressively, but this was a different situation.
He tried to defend his good name against unsubstantiated charges."
On Thursday, in the Senate Court Committee, a majority of the votes of the party (11 against 10) Mr Kavanaugh was allowed to take part in the vote of the entire Senate.
The Senator of the Republican Arizona Jeff Flake declared a dramatic moment to give his decisive voice to Kavanaugh only if the FBI will be given a week to investigate the misdemeanour of the current alleged accusations against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing, and President Trump said that the Agency has a wide range of powers and can question "anything you want".
In the "Schiaparelli" ready-made clothing collection – fantastic decorations
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
Schiaparelli has tried to answer that question.
The Paris Fashion House, which was founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothing and hands.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous hat of Elsa Schiaparelli's overturned shoe.
This time the fashion house, which has long fostered an eccentric image, appeared as very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find sensuals, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first composite in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched by music.
She and her friend El Salvador Dalhi have come up with a match between art and fashion, and now this idea has been taken over by Calvin Klein and Rafa Simons, who cooperate with the U.S. artist Sterring Ruby.
The Skland legend that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, developed and embroidered a evening dress before the demonstration, wanted to wash out a real mayo, but had not received his approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is inherent in the history of "Schiaparelli"," said Bertrandas Guyonas, the creative director of the last three years, who has been speaking in the fashion house's salon in Vandomas Square.
While creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he based on Schiaparelli's friendship with Manas Ray and in cooperation with My Ray's Foundation he created clothes according to well-known works of art.
The famous picture of the artist's close eyes is shown on T-shirts with Persex tears, and the red lips from Observatorium time: lovers, silk-shot on the true silhouette dress with a collage.

One of Elsa's strangeness was the superstitious urge to the letter S. Her company colour – "Shaping Rosary" inspired her perfumes "Shaping".
The first "Schiaparelli" created by Guyon with a key hole on the buckle is called "The Secret".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – £5,000.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened in the warehouse on the old left bank, showing the surreal side of the Paris fashion week, and for 100 € it was possible to buy the carpets of Virgilo Abloh from the soon-to-be Ikea collection.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans were arranged in a row on the pier, and they are not tempted to buy one of his works at more favourable prices than the men's clothes of Louis Vuitton are being created.
Ablohu this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one to which luxury fashion or designer furniture is available.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help to make a conversation at the lunch table.
That's what he thinks for a millennium," he said recently.
The audience gathered in Marais district realized that this event taking place in the garage would not be common when models started to drive through them on skateboards.
The collection of free colorful men's and women's coats by Andreas Kronthaler, the male designer of Vivinna Westwood, was based on portraits of Jessicaa Fulford-Dobson Kabul skaters.
Some women (and a few men) who were wearing escalating sandals were driving on skateboards.
Westwood, following his performance in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange-tipped heartg, joined her husband to his last bow on the podium, which gave her a flower bouquet.
Strong twin connection in photos
Peter Zelewski, who was born in Detroit and living in London, was already established as a street photographer when he started taking pictures of twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and a person, I was always impressed by twins and their remarkable connection, which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create a whole project, but, he said, "I acquired my addiction after taking a portrait of the first twins and there was no way back."
The upcoming book "Twos" by Zelewskis will print pictures and stories of 44 identical twins.
This project is more visual, he says: "It is not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to take a picture of the impacted and sensitive portraits of people."
Caregivers expressed mistrust of the trade union in wage negotiations
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, dissatisfied with the trade union's deal with the National Health Service on salaries, after the vote expressed mistrust of the Union and accused it of distorting the claims for the increase in wages that were expected.
This unprecedented decision follows a lengthy debate at the Royal College of Nursing, when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, wrongly promised members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, when the 1% wage limit will be abolished.
In the absence of an expected rise in wages, the members became angry and forced Davies to leave office, then filed a petition and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, followed by an untrusted college council.
“A fair and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen it,” said Maria Trewern, Director of Royal College of Care.
“The vote is clear and the board and the management of the Royal College of Nursing understood the message sent to it.
The Council has been seeking changes in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to and include the members' words; we will continue to do so."
The meeting will take place next week and it is expected that the members of the Royal College of Nursing will leave.
"The basis of care is trust," said the National Health Service nurse's newspaper "Guardian".
“The actions of the Royal Council of Nursing College have destroyed confidence in it, so the Council has to leave.
I hope that she will do her best and listen to the request.
I wonder if other trade union members will also seek restructuring."
State official of the General Trade Union in the National Health Service Rachel Harrison said in August “Guardian” said: “With salaries, employees of the National Health Service from all over the country understood before getting the expected raise.
So they were angry."
Before the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Nursing acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the remuneration negotiations in 2018 and had poorly informed about them.
However, it is also said that the Royal College's campaign to abolish wage restrictions led the government to abandon this restriction and to commit itself to a gradual increase in wages of 6.5% within three years.
The vote follows an independent investigation, which found that the college was tending to get down to the negotiations, and Davies was accused of not having carefully assessed the transaction.
It is argued that the Royal College of Nursing provided information that was not in line with the facts and therefore members were unable to make a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The college has published contradictory information as to whether all employees will get 3% of the wage increase.
In the brief report before the college assembly, the representatives wrongly claimed that the planned "up and ups of 3% in the gradual implementation of the reform".
Indeed, salaries should have been gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest-paid workers would have received an immediate increase.
"Almost all the information provided to members after the meeting on the implementation of the transaction was wrong (mostly because of attempts to simplify it)", said the representative of the EOM.
"In the view of the decision-makers, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not explained in a understandable and concise manner and the main advantages, including 6.5 and 29% of the calculations mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly identified and no reasonable decision could be taken."
The decision to express distrust was supported by 78% of the votes cast and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Care voted.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of Instagram’s direct broadcast while trying to "abduct" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, during which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate the sons from the parents.
At the beginning of the live broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (on the basis of Lohan's previously updated Instagram history), the actress offered to provide a place for the family to stay, but the situation quickly complicated.
“Good to everyone! I want to show you what family I met, ” she told the audience, “they are refugees from Syria, and I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
Come on, I'll take care of you," she said to her family before turning to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Looking at the movies?
It'd be fun watching a movie on TV or a computer."
When their parents refused, Lohan responded in opposition.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
"If someone offers them a home and a place for a stay, as I now do, you should meet.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't be kidding me."
When the family tried to get away from Lohan by going to the street, the actress followed her by further direct broadcast via Instagram.
“Look at what’s happening – it’s trafficking in children. That’s how you spoil Arab culture.
You're getting kids, though they don't want to come with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
Broadcasting ended with physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Video clips were distributed in social media and some users were interested in whether this could be compared to an attempt to kidnap.
The Independent contacted Lohan representative for comments.
One third of the British think they'll never pay off all the debts they have.
Almost a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts in life, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorcana, the results of which were revealed only by The Independent, showed that British people, especially those between the ages of 18 and 24, believe that they will have debts throughout their lives and only half of them expect to get out of them.
Last year, a report published by the Institute for Fiscal Research shows that students who have completed studies remain in debt at around £46 000, while the poorest students remain in debt at more than £57 000.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay out the full debt, so for the first 30 years they will work under debt.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Department of Statistics, the United Kingdom’s family debt is record-size and the British spends an average of 900 pounds each year more than they earn.
But is it worthwhile to worry about this dreadful statistics?
Are age-long debt just a new way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
As an example, cars that are another major purchase are bought after the purchase of their homes (if they smile at such success).
This week Auto Trader predicted that in a decade all new cars will be purchased for hire, which will be the usual way to purchase vehicles.
Jeannie Boyle, director of EQ Investors and certified finance planner, believes that expectations have really changed.
"At present, it is really normal to have debts: credit cards have become popular, interest-free refinancing, student loans and high-speed credits," she said.
"Our grandparents' generation was ashamed of having debts."
Nowadays, student debt and house price debt have become a normal phenomenon.
Moira O'Neill, Head of the Personal Finance Department of Interactive Investors, also supports this statement, thinking that the results could be worrying.
"If you lend a huge amount that is four or five times higher than your income, it may appear that the additional debt will not mean anything," she explained.
And that's how people get in trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts need to consider what would happen if the rates were to rise."
Perhaps it should not be surprising that the commentators of the financial industry are in no doubt.
Brian Brodie, Managing Director of the Credit Agency "Freedom Finance", says: "Schools are not taboos.
A loan for home repairs or the purchase of a new car is no longer considered the last option.
Low interest rates have helped many people save on fixed-term deposits, which generate higher returns, but are less easy to access to savings.
As a result, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
In the past six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with an excellent creditworthiness assessment."
Richard Haymes, Head of the Finance Resolution Unit of Equifax TDX Group, believes that such expectations – not to get off debt for the rest of your life – are a real concern.
He says: “In August, inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 per cent), and interest rates were rising and the growth in earnings was low, and so many people are concerned about the decision to borrow without a realistic plan to pay back their debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of personal bankruptcies will increase by 17 percent, and the main factor behind this is record consumer borrowing."
Debt may not be a matter of much concern while a person is working and earning, but it is not clear how lifeless debts will affect his or her well - being in old age.
The study of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out together with specialists in lending for mortgaged assets from More 2 Life, showed that people’s unguaranteed debts increased over the past four years by more than one third, i.e. more than twice the national average over the past five years.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than it earns.
Boyle added: “A growing number of people at the age of 55 choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their life in retirement.
Most often, these are the only savings they had to save.
Moreover, people think that using the wealth will pay out later, but the exchange of existing assets does not generate as much money as expected.
If asset prices fall, this situation will only get worse."
Singing up to half, Serena Williams sang “I Touch Myself” in order to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams has released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song "I Touch Myself" with a naked chest.
The tennis axis shared a video on its Instagram page and explained that the video had been created to encourage women to check their breasts.
"In this month of the fight against breast cancer, I wrote "The Divinyls" a version of the world hit "I Touch Myself" in order to remind women of their regular self-checking," wrote Williams.
“Yes, I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to determine as early as possible is to save a lot of lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
He continued: "This music clip is part of the project "I Touch Myself Project", which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women of her health."
The project supported by the bottom brand “Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia” (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of 53-year-old Amphlett.
The video that the tennis star published in his Instagram account received more than 1.5 million reviews and many fans praised the way the tennis player sang the song.
“The warmest wishes for this video and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," one of the fans wrote.
Another added: “Serena, it’s amazing.
I had breast cancer 20 years ago, and I found my nodule myself, even when my mammograms did not show anything.
It's just a matter of checking.
Thank you for not afraid of leaving the comfort zone – you're a real god!"
For the "Berle" project "I Touch Myself Project" has also released a new snake leather bra "The Chrissy", inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the bra will be sacrificed to BCNA.
While checking for signs and symptoms, it is important to know what to look for.
Signs of breast cancer are not only nodules, but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from the nipples, skin surface pittings, persistent pain or changes in the texture of the skin.
In addition, swelling at the lower arm or keybone, swollen veins, and a swollen nipple can warn about cancer.
Breast testing is recommended for women.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, you should contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by a family doctor to find that your symptoms need further evaluation, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to quaot
Adam Driver was a guest star of this week's “Saturday Night Live” and actually tried to make everybody laugh.
The best jokes of the show are usually not related to a specific actual event – as well as a new exhibition called "Carera Day".
The day of the U.S. high school is shown when the students bring their dads, and the teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) does not want his father, his old oil magnet, Abraham H. Parnassus, to speak.
Daniel Plainview, the character of Daniel Day-Lewis, who is a reassuring parnassus, could inspire megaloman's personality from the film "Bus blood", tells us how he managed the oil industry.
"I was seven months early," says Parnassuss for students.
“The incubator technology was just invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones have not hardened, but not my spirit.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague, SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who play a teacher, are barely laughing and can't watch Driver in the eyes.
However, the jokes of the actor of the “Star Wars” are getting worse and he starts to tell about the personal war with another oil magnator, H.R. Pickins.
"I led your granddaughter!" he is holy
"I filled her belly with my groaning seed and ruined your boy, it's my final revenge, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes, Parnassus became the same rememberable character of Adam Drewer as Kyle Ren from two films.
"Be damned, H. R."
Leaked songs by Kendrick Lamaro: Eight Unheard Works on the Internet
It seems that there were a lot of unused songs by Kendrick Lamar.
On Saturday there have been eight unheard works, whose parties were sung by SZA, Busta Rhymess, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashad and Abi Soul.
It is not clear where the songs came from, nor is the name of the collection "Bad Kid Hill City EP" and the illustration of the cover (probably created by the fan) official.
It may be that only the exposed and incomplete versions of the songs, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career, have been leaked.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Mad City era, while Heroin, which was sung together with SZA, is more similar to the sound track DAMN./Black Panther.
The following songs are distributed in the package:
‘Gang Member’;
"The Only Nigga";
"Want In Life";
"Loved Ones" (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
Look Over Your Shoulders (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
“Swimming Pools Alternative”.
"The Independent" contacted Kendrick Lamaras representative about the comment.
Conversation about the musical "Čikaga": There are no tickets left in Klaipėda, invites to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
The desire of Lithuania to see Klaipeda State Music Theatre musical "Čikaga" - does not ask.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musical of all time came into one more tour through the largest arenas of the country.

In December, the audience of "Chikaga" will meet a slightly changed composition of the artists.
One of the main roles of the musical was first entrusted to actor Thomas Gaib.
A talented and well-known actor in Chicago is the body of the unique Billy Flynn, the best and most influential lawyer in Chicago, who has no scrupulous changes in human fate.
Since the musical "Chikaga" of Klaipėda State Music Theatre is suitable for larger spaces, arenas, the composition of the artists appearing there is also larger than that of the work shown in Brodwey.
In the Lithuanian "Chicago" it appears almost half an artist.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming Klaipėda State Music Theatre soloist Beatai Ignatavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and charismatic Kaunas Music Theatre soloist Gabriele Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The musical "Chicago" represents the Chicago criminal world in the 1990s, which turns the prison walls into a star hill.

No matter what the main heroes, Roxye Hart and Velma Kelly, do, the meaning of life is to shine on a bright star.
Their life is the life for the message on the first page, for the title, the glosss, the alley of glory...
On December 13 "Čikaga" will be shown on Klaipeda "Švyturys" Arena, December 18 - on Kaunas "Žalgiris" Arena, December 20 - on Vilnius "Siemens" Arena.
Tickets are distributed by Tiketa.
Living room in Kaunas
The living room can be called the representative area of the house, where we spend time with our friends, welcome guests, etc. Therefore, it should be equipped in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceiling decoration, the taste of owners, appropriate furniture should be selected.
The site should not only be beautiful but also comfortable.
It is best to get an interior designer to help you to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or, vice versa, too empty.
It is recommended to first set the main point of the website, i.e. the item to which you will combine furniture and other details.
This may be a fireplace or other important website interior accent.
It would also be great to create a chat room where guests can communicate in a comfortable way so that they are not hindered by furniture, etc.
Sofas, the chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people rather than replace them with one another.
Don't push the furniture on the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance should be from the walls.
Although the room is small, leave at least a little space from the wall, do not push the furniture next to it.
If the room is large, leave even more space from the walls.
Indeed, the greater the distance, the better.
Create a balance when placing furniture
Consider the different details that will be on your website. size and location.
All elements shall be compatible with each other.
Living room furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
It will revitalize the interior of the site, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become unconcongruent.
We advise you to always consult interior designers.
By creating your own website interior, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk shifting to extremes: or you will create a boring interior, because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, make inappropriate choices or try to improvise.
Suitable lighting
This is a very important point.
After all, different light reveals space differently.
Lighting must be located at various levels: luminaires, wall lamps, floor lamps.
The prosecutor’s office appealed the righteous judgment to the heads of the LCF
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office appealed against the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF) leaders' judgement to the Vilnius Regional Court.
As reported by the prosecutor’s office on Monday, the complaint indicates that the municipality of Panevėžys had no legal basis to contribute financially to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panevėžys.
During the pre-trial investigation it was found that in order to find an opportunity to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, in 2010 a contract was concluded for the purchase and sale of services between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality.
The prosecutors argue that the public prosecutors did not intend and could not provide the services which the federation had to provide to Panevėžys City Municipality under the above-mentioned contract, since the planned services had already been received or planned to be financed by the State and the sponsors, part of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out from other funds, and part of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoice was issued: the money was transferred on the basis of invoices for the events which had not yet taken place.
Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office claims to disagree with the judgement of the court at first instance that the state itself ordered and instructed Panevėžys City Municipality to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since there was no state obligation regarding a particular hotel, only a proposal was made to Panevezys City Municipality to resolve the development of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the court has wrongly stated that the heads of LKF and Panevėžys municipality have tried to fulfil the state obligation without having a legitimate path, because the data in the case shows that there were possibilities to hold European Basketball Championships in other cities, without prejudice to laws.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office shall, by appeal, request the annulment of the court's judgement of first instance and, in this case, adopt a new judgment concerning seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court fully justified the Secretary General of the LKF Mindaugas Balčiūnas for all criminal offences.
This case concerns preparation for the European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
The accusations against Mr Balčiūnas were made of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The prosecutor's office charged M. Balčiūnas with the fact that as the Secretary-General of the LKF he agreed with the head of the Federation and the Executive Director that in the name of the Federation it would be possible to draw up the documents that did not meet the reality of the performance of the works – transfer and other financial documents and accounts of the services provided by the Government of Panevėžys.
According to a preliminary investigation carried out by officials of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevėžys Board, the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be used for fraud and forgery of documents for the benefit of LKF and later used for reconstruction of the Romantic hotel of Via Unica.
The head of this hotel Dalia Kuklerienė has been accused of bribery – it is suspected that she gave TV as a bribe to Balčiūnas.
All the individuals who have been tried with Mr Balciūnas have been justified.
The accusations in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like a Bermuda triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania from 1992 to now exceeded the total population of Alytus city and amounts to about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its safety are as clear as possible, then the choice of working remotely - from home, public spaces or even from other countries - is made with a kind of new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the provision of safety and health conditions for workers working at a distance from other employees of the company, the variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of questions, the press release states.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer shall pay compensation for the first two days of unemployment from 80% and for the remainder of the period - Sodra.
If it is found that the accident occurred during the course of work - since the first day of incapacity for work Sodra compensates 100% of the salary.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage managed by the BTA, it is clear that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at the workplace.
In most cases, these are a variety of physical activities, where the risk of injury is greater: care is taken to treat devices or equipment, and concentration or coordination is lost.
However, offices, where most of the most sought-after, best-paid professionals are now concentrated, face their own challenges, which are caused by the freedom of mobility, which is particularly popular with employers," says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of the Department of Human Resources Management at the BTA.
The legal acts in force in Lithuania recommend clear regulation of the employee's duties and limits of responsibility, definition of working time, place and functions, and this also applies to the formation of work remotely.
If so, it is easier to determine whether or not an accident occurred during work.
There are certainly different situations and nuances, each case being considered on an individual basis.
Workers have also often heard about the employer’s responsibility when they go to or from work or when travelling to work for accidents.
However, there are a number of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate conversations, to clarify and to make clear, as much as possible and acceptable, what situations are really considered accidents at work and who will already have the status of domestic injuries," the specialist advises.
J. Krikščiūnė states that in these times, when the computer and mobile phone and a stable Internet connection are often completely sufficient to perform their work functions, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
The employees are mobile, they can choose to work that day not at home, but by drinking coffee in a coffee shop or in a park enjoying the sun.
Is that a job or not?
What if the hours discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There may be situations that are really mixed, the circumstances of which are helped by clarification of the investigation being carried out, initiated by "Sodra" or the State Labour Inspectorate," says the specialist.
In its financial sense, the main difference between the event at work and the event at home is the amount of the disability benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė admits that it had to be informally heard of unpleasant experiences when employers try to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to approach medical professionals outside of work, take responsibility for themselves, thus decreasing financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude toward an employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people mentioned above encourages us to look for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: insurance of employer's civil liability for injury to workers, acquisition of injury insurance, disability insurance or even death insurance, as well as health insurance," says J. Krikščiūnė.
Mobile signature system is running again
After removing the fault, the mobile signature system is again in operation in Lithuania on Monday, the BNS was approved by the representatives of the service provider Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions.
This company reported disturbances on Monday morning, inconvenience experienced by Bite, Telia customers and parts of Tele2 customers.
The disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but representatives of SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Polish lessons for Lithuanian Rugby team
The Lithuanian rugby team that is debuting in the European Trophy Division is still having difficulty aligning itself with a higher level of competitors.
The Trophy Division on the Old Continent is the third according to the capacity after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
This is where 13-18 rating continental teams compete.
Lithuanians started the event in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai at 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend the Lithuanian national team visited Łódź, where it wasn't equal to the Polish national team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although Lithuanians were self-proclaimed, the fighting often violated the rules, and Polish regbys broke out in a fine blow.
A fine of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes was implemented by Wojciechas Piotrowiczius, who gave his own 12 points.
In the first chair, Lithuanians had to play for 10 minutes without Tautvydas Mazylis, who received a yellow card.
During the second round, the guests held several attacks, but they could not be completed effectively.
At that time, the Poles managed to break our defenses.
The pressure of the ball was applied by Mateusz Plichta, later by Krystyan Pogorzelskis and Mateusz Adamskis.
In addition to several important rugbists, the coach of the Lithuanian national team from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantage of the competitors and claimed that such a match provided a lot of valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and prevailed in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stand up to this match for as long as possible.
We have just come to this higher level, and we have to get to know it.
We won the first match against cheques, but now we met very powerful competitors and we had to recognise their advantage.
The Polish national team provided us with useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, who has been standing at the steering wheel of the Lithuanian national team for four years.
The Lithuanians will play another game at the Trophy Division on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams are still in competition with this division.

The Japanese Coast Guard is looking intensively for a missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given in 2014 to the whole tiny island in the north of Japan.
A small, pointless and unworthy island, which was essentially unsuitable for life, was very important for Japan.
So important that the territory that is missing now is intensively explored - will it yet come?
Why does Japan need this island?
I don't care.
It is likely that ice and submersible landslides once and for all were falling on this island, even though it was just about two metres above the surface of the water.
There is little doubt that the island has simply broken, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island was gone nobody knows exactly - it was so useless that nobody was enough for it.
Perhaps the first Japanese fishermen to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, because there are better ways to catch where fishing can take place and where contentious Russian waters start.
That was exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
The narrow strip of the earth was the western edge of the Courilles Island.
This chain of islands, which Russia calls the Curylian Islands, and Japan the Northern Territories.
The conflict has continued with some such interruptions since the middle of the 19th century, but it was full of strength in the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but Japan also historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They first formed a map, took more detailed research, recording a large number of small islands.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin was coming to the latter and all the Courilles Islands to Japan.
Thus, these two states settled before the defeat of Japan in the Russian Empire in the war against Sakhalin in 1905.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Courella Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not have great claims on the whole of the malt, although it was the first one, but would like to have four islands - Iturupo, Kuanashi, Chottan Islands and Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, because the islands have been investigated first and Japan has also been part of the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed that Russia share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the northern territories, but now that the island is lost, this geographical link is as if lost.
That physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters disappeared.
This is a huge loss, which leads to the search for the remains of the island.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the simple definition of an island - it must be land.
This means a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a significant decrease in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
It's just interesting what the island's search mission expects, because it's definitely not lost or sailed.
Unbelievable drama in Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams
More than a week had to wait for the final Verdict of judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian doubles were held in Poland.
Lithuanians won the four strikes, and Poles won the same.
On the other hand, the final outcome of the crucial due to the long-standing discussions of the Chamber of Judges and the final decision of the Event Secretariat.
The national team meeting started with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) assured 3:0 won Jakuba Surma, soon Edgars Kurdels (up to 60 kg) after a hard fight 2:1 defeated Radomir Obrušniak.
Two victories followed: Damian Durcazzas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 overcame Mantas Duzhenas, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 exceeded Simon Ban.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned the balance to the Lithuanian team.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartosz Golebiewsky.
In the next battle, Piotr Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) in the third round, a clear victory over Eyard Kasmote and the result again became equal to 3:3.
Brother Joculus had different successs.
Robert Jokulys 3:0 (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzey Colton, while Arvydas Jokulys (over 91 kg) had to acknowledge Adam Kulik's advantage in the first round.
The main cause of the discussion was Tado Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michalo Soczynski's fight.
That is why the final outcome of the cross-border meeting took more than a week.
One judge gave a victory to Poland, two judges to Lithuania, but due to a technical mistake the point dedicated to one judge to Lithuania was included M. Soczynskis.
After a long dispute, the victory is left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
The winner of the Lithuanian-Polish national team meeting won the result at 10:8 (two points for the victory).
They managed to pay back to Lithuanians for the staggering defeat suffered by the previous mutual match.
At the meeting in Marijampolė in 2015, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five battles out of six and won the victory at 10:2.
The meeting for the leaders of the Lithuanian national team in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian boxing championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the country's honour at the World and European Championships next year.
How does the dog determine the direction in which a man went?
You already know that the dog’s smell is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, some of them smelling even recognize diseases.
The track dogs are well known and famous in the movies, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine in which direction the owner of the trace went?
Indeed, this issue is much more complex than you think.
Tracking of feet consists of three stages - finding, directing and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide when the human steps have been taken.
After all, there's never been a second between different steps, so there's no difference in their smell, right?
Not exactly.
A 1990 study at the University of Oslo described experiments that led to a 90 - degree course of human passage.
Tests have been carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily set the direction of human walking, even when he tried to mislead them by passing backwards.
Can you imagine how difficult this is?
The difference between the odour of the adjacent traces is very small and decreases with time.
But scientists say that this is not so strange - dogs could say, and which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their smell is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by its ossile areas (how our brain is dominated by the regions responsible for vision).
The dog’s nose has 125-300 million odour receptors.
In general, the dog smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different smells plays an even greater role.
Scientists then conducted similar experiments with traces of bikes, but it was much more difficult to track dogs.
This is due to the fact that the cancer of the bike is not segmented as traces of a moving man, making it more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the owners of the strongest smell.
This title is likely to be passed on to bears.
The white bear’s males have been poresping the ready - prepared females for hundreds of miles, while the brown bear smells an animal even 30 miles [30 km] away.
Private forests promise to regulate cuttings
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain about deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, there was public displeasure about the forests crossing the Labanor Regional Park.
For the month, the felling of these forests was stopped.
The Minister has acknowledged that there have been no gross violations of the cut in Labanore.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced some restrictions in view of the working group's proposal to strengthen deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation to adjust deforestation will be in place by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are being imposed as those which will apply to felling in public forests and to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want, and put what they want together, in the LRT TV programme "Culturingly with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylist, she gradually gathered a great crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, you try to taste a man, you tempest to yourself, and you drink that taste slowly over time," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170,000 followers in her Facebook account - she has reached this number using a particular strategy: "In the beginning, you try to taste a person, you temp to yourself, you drink that taste slowly over time."
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims that she does not tolerate the uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She notes that human culture is no longer present in social networks, because many internees come to them to get angry with someone or to read the comments of other humiliating people: 'For example, when I was a teenager, there was a time when I wanted to go with everyone and curse - now I have no wish anymore.'
"False life is the worst thing.
And there is a lot of this on social networks.
In Feisbuck a little less than an instagram," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says that she is sending a specific message to social networks - this is about the emancipation of women.
It also promotes the production of magazines, and in its work it also sees the creations.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is the expression of pure art, but I know there's a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, just like vanity.
I'm on the balance, it's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a false life.
It is much better to give people what they want and quietly put what they want," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, well-known people suggested through life stories: to talk about backstages, failures, and life-related events, thus remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that Mr Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, culture does not have the opportunity to please anyone, do not entertain anyone, do not do any entertainment or show real values.
"As a boring teacher against students, is there a chance?
If we don't find a way to present that art, advertise without advertising, we won't get anything out of it.
When we're real and we catch the reader, maybe something will change.
You'll have one, second, third - and already addiction," she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared when the helicopter fell in Lituya Bay north of June
On Saturday, after the helicopter accident, three people were searched for north of Juno in Alaska.
One man was saved after Friday’s disaster, and the other three could not be found.
The helicopter crashed near the Gulf of Lituya, northwest of June.
It was found that it was Airbus H125 on a long journey to Grand Preri in Texas.
Aircraft ruins were detected on Friday at 100 ft off the shore.
According to the Associated Press, one rescued person was 14 years old.
A mild hypothermia has been reported, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers were flying in a falling helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King disappeared in 53 C.E., Josh Pepper (42 C.E.) and Andrew Pepper (11 C.E.).
It has been established that the senior Pepperdas is the director of the Alaska construction company Davis Designers & Engineers.
It's not clear what caused the accident.
The National Transport Security Council stated that an investigation had been initiated.
"In a broken helicopter that was completely new – just from the factory – two adults and two teenagers fly", says coastguard officials report on the basis of the CPCA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including those in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that loved ones “have not yet lost hope of a miracle”.
With the help of a coastguard helicopter, rescuers renewed their search for experienced climbers on Mount Nevis Fort William, Scotland, 17 February 2016.
On Saturday, three people were searched for in Alaska after the helicopter accident.
"I have suffered sexual violence"
Presidential Adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday morning revealed the sexual violence suffered.
Conway commented on serious disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway excitedly revealed that he had been subjected to sexual violence himself, and defended Kavanaugh against the leader Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence by ignoring the facts unfavourable to the accusations.
“I am very sorry to the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I myself had sexual violence," said CNN at the State of the Union on Sunday.
"I am the victim of sexual violence, and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our own actions."
Conway said that the news network should be ashamed of comparing Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in a state prison in Pennsylvania last week.
Conway also criticised the Senate Courts Committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who was in his office engaged in oral sex and lied to the US people.
Survey shows that Kavanaugh and Ford testimonials divided U.S. society
The Americans disagree on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford – the accused claims that the judge sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
The number of people who think that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying is almost the same: 38 percent of those surveyed say that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying in evidence, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Courts Committee of the Senate listened to both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed charges to the judge.
After publishing the letter, both Ford and Kavanaugh said that they were prepared to speak against the committee.
By giving evidence, Ford claimed to be 100 percent sure that it was tried to attack Kavanaugh at a party in the early 1980s rather than another person.
In her emotional opening speech in 51 C.E., a woman said that she felt a civil duty and could not remain silent.
"I'm so scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I studied at high school."
Ford and Kavanaugh, who denied the charge of sexual abuse against two other women, said that "nothing was sexually attacked in high school, college or at any time later".
“Everyone tried to find anything that would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting,” he said.
"It's the simplest slander in the last minute."
On 27-28 September, the results of a survey carried out by youGov, which surveyed 2607 people, were not surprising – the opinions of the people who felt different parties differed: democratic supporters believe in Ford (73 per cent), and Republicans believe in Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although Ford believed more Republicans than Kavanaugh – Democrats (14 per cent, compared to 11 per cent).
Founder of "Body Worlds", called "Dactara Death", wants to be cut and demonstrated at his own exhibition
The German scientist who invented plasticization wants to become an eternal part of his Body Worlds exhibition.
Guntheris von Hagens has developed an innovative approach that allows us to demonstrate the bodies, skulls and organs of an exhibition that has traveled around the world and has received both admiration and contradictory assessments.
In 73 C.E., a dying man ordered his wife to plasticize after his death to become a permanent exhibit at Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
“In a sense, it will be the end of his life’s work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to The Observatory.
She said that the husband gave strong instructions on what to do with his body, and the whole process would take about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries should be ejected and silicone injected into the body and placed in the appropriate position.
"He said to me, "Angelina, you can freeze me up to 25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you will have to add your hands, otherwise I will freeze."
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, and then I'll have to do it."
Then, ideally, by wearing an indistinguishable soft fetruse hat, he will join the exhibition at the London Pavilion next to the other bodies that have stagnated in time with upright positions, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens was famous in the United Kingdom for performing an autopsy on the direct broadcast of British television (the first public autopsy in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited "Body Worlds" exhibitions around the world since 1995.
The founder of the Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, said that 100% of the exhibition, covering about 28 000 square feet, was given by people who "have given their consent because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help to see possible problems".
“We see and read so much terrible things that we fear death.
No one will escape it, death is common to us all, and I think that "Body Worlds" shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernalis.
Ronald's lawyers threaten court action against rape
On Friday, the lawyers of the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo said that the German magazine, which published the statements of an “obviously illegal” American, would be suing her for rape in 2009.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated in his statement that the article of the magazine "Der Spiegel" was an "unacceptable statement of private accusations" and he will seek legal redress for the magazine for his client.
The application to the agency Reuters was sent by the company Gestifute representing Ronaldo in response to the request to comment on Friday's article "Der Spiegel" published on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Der Spiegel first announced charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo has won the title of the best player in the world five times.
This summer he moved to Juventus Italy from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the Der Spiegel statement.
The magazine announces that the suspected rape took place in June 2009 in Las Vegas hotel room – this was said by Leslie Mark Stovallas, lawyer of Kathryna Mayorga, who was indicting the charge.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed out of court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for the $375 000 paid by Ronaldo.
Stovallas did not immediately reply to the Reuters e-mails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls by phone at home.
However, Stovallas told the magazine “Der Spiegel” that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
The Mayorga magazine "Der Spiegel" was told that they no longer have the contract because they still feel the consequences of the nine years' old night.
"I have experienced serious crises," she said, "Der Spiegel".
“ And yet, the charge of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to test "Self-Publishing 3.0"?
The new White Paper published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the "#selfpub3.0" website explains for the first time how to join other business creators, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Orna Ross, the founder of the Union of Independent Creators, has already been recognised for the first time by one of the 100 most influential people in publishing, during the conference Digital Book World 2018, it will be explained why the creators should allow "Self-Publishing 3.0" methods.
“Use trends, such as the growing use of personal brands, responsible consumption and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create particularly favourable conditions for creators’ businesses,” says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers who are aware of the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages creators to create several sources of remuneration through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
Direct sales, subscription models, crowding-in assistance, widespread distribution models and other sources of income, such as online training and related entity activities, can be earned.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in various formats to the widest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage change of mindset and to learn how to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, is not transferred unwisely to another company, such as a specialised publishing house or a self-publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be used not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; it also stressed that the real independence of creators, like other people, is ensured by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book "Self-Publishing 1.0" describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
The theme “Self-Publishing 2.0” is the sale of books for e-book readers and telephones in online book stores.
Now comes a new "Self-Publishing 3.0" era, where independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organisation that unites authors who produce books on their own.
The objective of the Union is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help beginners to sell books and encourage creators to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and central bank have warned the Italian Government about the planned deficit
After hearing the plans of the populist government to significantly increase deficit expenditure next year, the President of Italy and the Head of Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be managed.
The Management Party (the opposition Five-star movement and the right-wing North League) submitted a deficit proposal for 2019, which would reach 2.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and exceed the objective of the previous administration three times on a late Thursday evening.
On Friday, this report confused the market and led to the sale of bonds and hit the banks' shares.
Moreover, such plans are not consistent with the European Union, applying and monitoring EU fiscal rules.
Addressing the audience in the Presidential Palace, which commemorates the 70th anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella said that according to the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be controlled".
"We will thus protect our citizens' savings," he said.
Some time later, at a conference in central Italy, the President of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, said that it is no longer possible to further increase the country's debt, which is the largest of the European Union's major economies and amounts to 131 percent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and control and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to the state news agency Ansa.
"The school must be consistently reduced."
The leader of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvinis, replied to the words of Mattarella that the debt had increased due to the strict requirements imposed on Brussels for a year.
"Sleep, Mr. President," said Salvinis in his statement.
“The debt of the State has been high because of the budgets imposed by Europe for the year. We are finally changing our plans and striving for a better future and growth.”
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, the head of the Five-star movement, Luigis Di Maio, said that money stolen earlier would be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government was not seeking to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The Governing Parties pressed on the non-group-related Minister for Economic Affairs Giovannis Tria to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media stated that Mattarella had supported Tria's failed attempt to keep the budget deficit below 2% of GDP.
The Presidents of the country and of the central bank shall not directly affect economic policy.
The President of the 77th century may reject the law and refer it back to Parliament, but only once.
The Parliament can then re-admit and legitimise the unchanged law.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors have missed huge waves
The Indonesian Geophysic Agency withdrew the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, followed by a severe earthquake that sent huge waves to the northeast coast of the island of Sulawes, where hundreds of people were killed and thousands were left homeless.
Car dunes after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake and tsunami of 7,5 points that struck the town of Pala, about 1,500 miles (940 miles) from Jakarta.
The officials said on Sunday that the number of victims is likely to increase.
On Friday, many people gathered to the Palu beach festival, which was hit by many six - foot - high waves that had been killed (18 feet) in the dark.
The Geophysic Agency at the BMKG received criticism on Saturday in the social media: many people wondered whether the tsunami warning had been lifted too early.
The Agency stated that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to revoke the warning on the basis of data from the nearest flood sensor at around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We don’t have any observation from Palu.
So we had to make a decision on the basis of the data we had," said Rahmat Triyon, Head of the BMKG Centre of earthquakes and tsunamis.
The nearest flood meter, which measures changes in the sea level, only found a "non-significant" wave of six centimetres (2.5 inch) and did not notice huge waves near Palu.
“If we had a flood meter at Palu or had data from there, the situation would of course be better.
We have to think about this in the future", said Triyona.
According to the officials, the tsunami hit Pala and the surrounding areas at a high speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is unclear whether it occurred before or after the withdrawal of the warning.
Residents are looking for dead bodies on the street after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
“Based on the videos distributed in social media, we believe that the tsunami took place before the official withdrawal of the warning,” said Triyona.
The most damaging 9.5-point earthquake occurred on the second Christmas day of 2004 and caused a huge tsunami that killed about 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The imaginary city of Palu, home to 380 000 people, is near the mouth of the narrow bay in the northeast of the island of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (NDA), the tsunamis destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Badptiste Gombert, a geophysical researcher at Oxford University, the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
The Friday earthquake was caused by a horizontal break: adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally rather than vertically as usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there was a landslide in the sea that pushed a lot of water and caused a tsunami,” he said.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Agency for the Reduction of Accidents, told the correspondents that his team "will be prepared to send easy-to-understood public warnings", when the tsunami warning was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the residents were repeatedly sent text messages with warnings, but Nugroho said that because of the earthquake the power and communication lines were stopped and there were no sires along the coast.
The Indonesians doubted in the social media whether the BMKG had to revoke the tsunami warning and were angry about the lack of timely information.
“I’m disappointed... The warning was cancelled... and the tsunami still happened...” – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: The "Mollywood" duo is going to beat ticket selling records
On Saturday, Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood became the first two of Europe to win all four pair matches and will probably be recorded in history, as representing Europe is already leading the result at 10:6 against the Ryder Cup final.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau at 5:4, they became the first couple of Europeans to win all four matches.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do so in 1979.
The staggering results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
The couple three times won 14 important titles of Woods and twice won over Patrick Reed.
They have also won the victory over Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, a U.S. team that won three other events this week.
Molinery and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five.
Fleetwood has already gained the most points in Ryder's Cup pieces as a newcomer European.
A couple of young fans, named Mollywood, did not seem at first sight to be able to lead the European team forward.
The newcomers of the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, are not expected to perform like this, and Molinary was in trouble with none of the previous six matches and landed in four.
However, there was also hope: "Fleetwood" was the first in Europe last year, knows "Le Golf National" square as its five fingers, and here in 2017 won the "French Open" tournament and demonstrated a decisive temperament during this year's "U.S. Open".
The Molinaris is a new British Open champion and is considered to be the most consistent European tournament player – it is a useful feature in a fine square where high grass can cause destruction, as shown by American failures.
These features of the players and harmonious game in the square made them invincible.
"I feel a little empathetic now, but only Saturday," said the relaxing Fleetwood, who played all weekend with a wide smile in the face.
This afternoon we showed up well, we played stablely and well.
If we stand together in history, that will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
Molinari was also happy.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to fulfil our duty and not just get into record books, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for 4.5 point that we need to win; it won't be easy."
Ritere fever!
The Irish village became a battlefield of the Middle Ages
The Claregalway Castle in the west of Ireland was previously the main fortress of the 15 - century English knight’s family and was remembered of its origin this Saturday.
Two-wheeled swords during the medieval battle festival at Claregalway Castle in Golvey, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
The fully restored Anglo-Norman period house with the tower yard has been transformed into a medieval battlefield where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world have restored contact battles and games that were popular many centuries ago.
Donna Dornan, who is dressed for a Knight, is patrolling the Claregalway Castle in the great art at the medieval fighting festival in Golvey, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
“It’s a great weekend trip and something unusual,” said Dennis Fitzgerald from Kerry’s county, who became the owner of the tavern for the weekend.
“So we came back to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything as necessary," said the theatre employee, who is the first to participate in the armed battle festival.
In the field, the fighters fought in an authentic manner, and while their swords were dull, some helmets were folded and one injured his lips.
The riders showed their skills by riding and cutting cabbages and aubergines in half.
With metal castings, they put arms on a bitch, and the condiment merchants made medicine, while the craftsmen wept and paint wool.
Seriously minded and well - trained participants tried to get involved in their roles.
“I think anyone can put on a suit, but a sense of role is art,” said Helena Stockpool, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are handmade.
I've already been sewing my belt for two years, and now I've got a dress and I just put 800 pearls on her sleeves.
It matters to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed on Sunday following the earthquake and tsunami on the Indian island increased to 832, while the area affected is larger than originally thought.
The agency's representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at the news conference that many people were stuck in the ruins after the 7,5-point earthquake that took place on Friday and caused the tsunami waves six meters (20 feet) high.
FBI addressed the second woman who accused the candidate Kavanaugh
The FBI agents who investigated the case of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh, turned to the second woman who accused him of a sexual attack, which was revealed on Sunday by the woman's lawyer.
The report by John Clune, lawyer of Deborah Ramirez, states that the investigation of the Kavanaugh case by the FBI will not only cover the individual accusations made by the Conservative of the Federal Court of Appeal Dr Christinea Blasey Ford this week in a dramatic session of the Senate.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her his penis at a party where he was drunk, which was held at Yale's university communal when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump submitted to pressure from the moderate Republicans of the Senate and instructed the FBI to conduct a study after a Thursday meeting of the Senate, where Professor Ford of the University of California made detailed accusations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at the party that took place in 1982, when they both studied at school and were teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
A short man denied this and published a Twitter message: "I really want them to interview all the people they need at their own discretion."
The representative of the White House, Ray Shah, said that the Senate had determined the scope and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they have been taught," said Shah.
The United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
On Sunday, Environment Minister Michael Gove said that the United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards so that trade can be concluded after Brexito.
Mr Michael Gove, State Secretary for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Great Britain, arrives at Duning Street in London, 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservative Conference, Gove said that it would be useful for the United Kingdom to be aware of its high-quality food products and that the government would announce a food strategy this year.
Europe recovers the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinaris earned his praise on Sunday by returning Ryder's cup to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16 hole and earned a point that helped to achieve the required 14,5 result.
Mickelson gave up his first ball in the water at the hole, and when he was able to survive, Molinaris became the first European to win all five matches a week, even though none of the previous six were hit.
Europe's victory has already been assured that the Italians have released the blow from the ground and that the continent's victory lacked one point, while Henrik Stanson and Sergio Garcia were in the first mače and have taken at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day they first came to the result of 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from possible 12 to recover the trophy and consolidate their rule at home which continued since 1993.
Prior to this, the team only managed to eliminate the four-point difference and win the unit competition twice: this was done by the U.S. team in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 at the “Medina Miracle” competition, but no one expected another amazing return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave the Jim Furyk team hope of winning the first match, but then the European team points spread throughout the square.
Thorbjorne Olesen broke Jordan Spieth, and his teammate newman Jonas Rahm – Tigger Woods: the 14 most important sportsman lost four times out of four titles.
Ian Poulter, the best player in the Ryder Cup, has probably received most ovations this week, when the world's best player, Dustin Johnson, landed on his 18th Ride Square and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then we had to wait for the match to end first, and it was Molinary's game, which caused a wave of joy in a crowd that was the greatest event in history.
RT World News: The Erdogan German police used neonacio as a code name
According to the local media, the secret officials in eastern Germany, who kept Turkish President Erdogan on his visit to Berlin this week, used the name of the sadly famous neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the region stated that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany investigated two members of the elite anti-terrorist unit SEC.
The men were assigned to protect the Turkish President Repec Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
Officials were required to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sadly famous neonaci, who belonged to the Group of National Socialist Underground (NSU) extremists, who killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer at the beginning of this century.
The local media report that the strange code name was discovered when two policemen asked for permission to have access to internal documents necessary to carry out the task.
The leading officials immediately withdrew the police.
Peterica Kleine, the Chief of the Saxon Criminal Police, first responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the Boehnhardt name was "Perhaps it was the most foolish" and thus "the victims and their loved ones are clearly ignored".
The Saxon Minister of the Interior, Roland Woller, agreed with this statement and called the decision "sliding, dreadful and totally unacceptable".
The Erdogan visit to Berlin on Friday caused many contradictory assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, "because in the event of disagreement, it is necessary to resolve them in person at the meeting".
For the first time, the public heard about NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his fellow, Uwe Mundlos, were detected in the trailer house in eastern Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed another and then committed suicide following a failed attempt to rob a bank in the city of Eisenach.
The third member of the Neonazi group, the last remaining Beate Zschaepe, is soon arrested.
In July this year, the German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 charges of murder.
She denied her contribution to the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused felt morally guilty because she did not try to stop murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies received a lot of criticism.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of victims believe that the group had many more associates.
It also became clear that the German internal intelligence agency BfV infiltrated a large number of informants into the NSU and constantly prevented the investigation of murders, attempts to kill and robberies associated with the group.
The Musk withdraws from the head of Tesla and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who had sued him for fraud in Twitter messages, where he claimed to be a private company in Tesla.
The Muscos will have to leave the head office, but the Director-General will remain.
The instruments of the agreement state that Muscos is to be removed from Tesla’s post as Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to that position for a period of three years.
He's gonna have to pay a fine of $20 million.
It all started with a Twitter message that was through carelessness or deliberately written misleadingly, so Muskas will have to receive prior confirmation before saying or publishing about Tesla "in any format, including, but not limited to, social media (e.g. Twitter), company's website (e.g. company's blog), press releases and investor calls".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it has not checked Musk's initial Twitter message.
In the complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors on 7 August by Twitter, where he said that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company with a single share worth $420 – therefore the company's securities cost more than 10 per cent.
The Musk soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public, and angry investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Muskas' initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it was not based on facts".
Muskas himself explained in the blog that this error could be justified: after a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Property Fund, he was impressed that he was able to agree on the funds.
It is reported that Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission have come close to a milder penalty – Muskas would have had to abandon the chairman's position for only two years and should not admit the fault, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and probably he changed his opinion again and accepted more stringent conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as in the old one, Muskas does not have to confess to blame for misleading investors.
The Patriarch of Alexandria committed to support the canonical Ukrainian church and urged orthodox groups to unite
Theodore II of Alexandria expressed himself on the basis of the canonical Ukrainian orthodox church belonging to the Moscow patriarch.
He spoke in response to the separation between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Constantinople Patriarchate.
On Thursday, Theodore arrived in the city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and believers in orthodox times.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, landing only in the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I came to tell you: do not refuse the orthodox faith and the canonical church," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Before his visit to Odessa, he met with the Polish orthodox metropolitan politician Savva, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity", said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently suffered a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian orthodox church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarchies to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering in another’s affairs.
The examiners are special representatives of the patriarch who formally take a position higher than that of the metropolitan Onufriy, who is the current head of the Ukrainian orthodox church in Moscow.
The Moscow Patriarchate has responded to Constantinople's actions and has withdrawn all general church services and membership in organizations led or co-chaired by Constantinople.
It is claimed, however, that this decision warned Constantinople not to take any other hostile action, nor is it considered that the two churches had completely broken the bonds.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one church recognizes the Ukrainian orthodox church, which belongs to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognise its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separated churches – the Ukrainian orthodox church, which originated in the 1990s, which belongs to the Kiev Patriarchate.
This religious movement even has the patriarch’s declared leader, Philaret, who seeks the official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus opened for the first time in three years the main trade transition between Syria and Jordan
According to the state news agency SAA, the Syrian government has stated that it will open a border crossing between Nasib and Jordan, which has been closed for three years due to military action in this area.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side have abandoned the lands near the city of Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
Key messages from the UN speech of Lavrov
While visiting the UN Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov attacked the West because of "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not give in to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday, the Minister at the UN General Assembly stated that some Western countries are putting pressure on others in an effort to maintain “the positions of world leaders assigned to themselves,” without conscience.
He did not refer to specific countries, but said they used "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world has to pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, representing Russia in a decade at the UN, said at the meeting that diplomacy and a negotiating culture are being replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions in place without the UN's approval.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied by many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and recalled the blockade applied by the US to Cuba over many years.
"But the story hasn't taught us anything," said Lavrov and added that "Western supporters tend to blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unfounded accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libyan affairs."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions, and he reminded us of the seven - year war in Syria as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to demolish the Damascus regime could have been disastrous for the whole country and opened the way for the establishment of a "terrorist calphate".
Lavrov praised the peace process in Astana, which was initiated jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process helped to prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other groups that wanted to seize the whole of Syria.
The most important thing now is to rebuild war - destroyed places in the country and help refugees to return safely to their homes.
Lavrov returned to the battle of the great forces and said that the UN was actually established "after learning from the Second World War".
The Russian Foreign Minister recalled that in 2018 he was 80 years old from the signing of the "false" Munich Treaty in 1938, in which France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German-based Czechoslovakia to calm Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", a year later, war began.
"Munch betrayal" shows how far the "egoism of countries and disregard of international law" can lead to," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and violence of the colonial era must be placed in a historical archive or waste bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, said Lavrov.
"If you have any questions or accusations, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile your interests."
Crisslas in the eye of a stranger?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are covered by fog and Bibi's finger blows into Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister stated in a speech by the UN General Assembly that Tehran had sensitive nuclear weapons.
It may be that the accuser of Israel is hiding something.
On Thursday, Benjamin Netanyahu, a favorite Israeli Prime Minister, unveiled news – he showed pictures of high-fashioned sites where Iran supposedly considered nuclear material.
Tehran responded without delay that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel has never recognised (but has never denied) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murad Gazdieva tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually find a log in his own eye.
Government of Scotland: no complaints to Alexo Salmondo by January
The Scottish Government stated that no complaints had been registered with respect to Alexo Salmondo by January of this year.
Two accusations of sexual harassment were made to the former first minister in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, is a party to the proceedings with the Scottish Government regarding the complaint process against him.
In response to the claim that one of the complaints was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been recorded by January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government received two complaints in January concerning Alex Salmond.
We could ignore them or hide them.
In the past, the first Deputy Minister at the time did not receive any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we said, the first Minister heard about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will persevere in defending our position.
The Scottish Government will seek as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot comment on Mr Salmond's case for legal reasons."
Alexo Salmondo’s representative said: “We will not comment on anything, since our petition against our permanent secretary is now being examined in court and we hope that a decision will be made shortly.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasg broke the "Dragons" result at 29:13: "Warriors" player Lee Jones's tavern
Glasg regained the title of winners in Guinness Pro14 league, earning extra points and defeating Dragons in Scottston stadium, while the coach Dave Rennie does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game could have been more accurate.
After a sudden defeat on the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked a lot of changed teams to try and, although she was able to collect the necessary points so that she could stay at the top of the A conference, the matches played with windy and rainy air were certainly not smooth.
“I think we defended great tonight, we played on the right side of the square and our strategy was good,” Rennie said.
“We have to play more accurately and we have been able to seize more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are pleased with that.
We need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points that we have earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won extra points, but next week we have to do more at home with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the weather was windy, the Glasgow team early began to earn points, but TMO caught all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including his captured Nico Matawalu internal transfer in the left corner.
The disappointment was not long enough: the left pillar, Olis Kebble, broke in the middle for the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings, easily caught the throw.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received a fine and made another player a safe match in 20 minutes' time and the Walesans scored a point.
The match after the rather quiet first half was almost reached at the sign of half an hour: Glasgow's attackers consistently attacked the "Dragons" line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry fined the Falsians for 22 minutes because of their remoteness on the Hastings side.
Warriors went into the fighting, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because after several hits, the left side of Matawalu could not control the ball and it was passed on to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings beat the Dragons line and wisely passed the ball to the running Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings to his position and the result in the middle of the match became 12:6.
Glazgus had a very successful first minute in the second half: he fell down Alex Dunbar's ball for the second test in Lee Jones and was assisted by Hastings.
However, after the failure, Warriors did not give up – only four minutes later, they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons centre, Adam Warren, took it under the gates, earning points, and then took Josh Lewis after an open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the lead position and gained extra points on 54 minutes after the fourth test when Huwas Jones crossed right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure of the four tests).
The Glasgow maintained a comfortable higher position and carried out the fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar passed the ball after the fighting with George Horne and Hastings scored points.
Kebble was declared the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously prevented us from playing, but we got rid of ourselves at the middle," said the coach.
“He missed a few meters, but he was slippery and still managed to distance.
He's in good shape and he trusts himself."
“Ayr United” won the “Morton” result of 1:5: five stars “Ayr” broke the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore scored two goals, and Declan McDaid added another one, thus helping Ayr to stay at the top of the championship table.
"Ayr" broke forward after the Shankland Gate, beaten from six yards after Michael Rose's angular impact on McDaid.
Morton's 35th-minute first attempt was to level up the result, when Charlie Telfer took the ball away from the dulling Robbie Crawford on his own ground and sent it down through the Ayr Gater Ross Doohan to the far country.
Players from Grinoc had the chance to blow ahead for the second minute when Doohan destroyed Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak fine, which was easily caught by the gatekeeper.
"Ayr" for the 74th minute, the second time, when the transfer of the long distance of the replacement Craig McGuffie was brought to the air, and when he fell on the ground, another replacement player Craig Moore was sent to the gate.
Moore gave the ball to Shankland for the same minute, who killed 17 wins this season.
While the fans were raging, Moore returned to his side on the fourth side of the court, and McDaid sent the ball off to the gate.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" match ended at 0:2: first win of young people in the league
"I am happy, I feel a relief, I am happy," said Ray McKinnon, after the very necessary first Falkirk victory in the league and earned season points.
The attacker “Rangers” borrowed by “Zak Rudden” (18 C.E.) earned a goal in both chairs and pushed the host team “Alloa Athletic” to the base of the championship and freed the club from the most distressing problems.
"It was an important game for us", said McKinnon.
“We probably deserve more during the last three events, so it was great to earn three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have caused anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent a ball to Patrick Brough for 26 minutes and gained a goal from the middle of the second platform of the gate, when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over the gatekeeper Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but failed," – admitted Jimas Goodwinas, the head of "Wasps".
"Hearts" fans' petition for the semi-finals received more than 11 000 signatures
"Hearts" fans' petition about the Betfred Cup's semi-finals schedule has been signed by more than 11 000 people.
Sirgali is angry about the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and in the same stadium.
As suggested by the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to hold "Aberdeen" – "Rangers" play play at 12:00, and "Hearts – "Celtic" at 19:45, thus provocating the anger of both "Jambos" and "Dons" fans.
The Evening News together with Aberdeen Evening Express asked the fans for a fair decision on Saturday.
Both Aberdeen and Hearts condemned the so-called “Super Saturday” decision: both clubs have published statements in which they criticise the schedule.
On Thursday, a petition was published on the change.org requesting that one of the matches be moved to another place or date.
The man is accused of breaking two women in the village of Kent
Two women in the sixties and eights died in the place of the crime.
According to the police representative, another man, who has also reached the 70th century limit, is hospitalized and stable.
The 28th-year-old on the same street remains under arrest and will be tried on Monday for two murders and one attempt to kill Medway at the MA court, where he will be on video.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but they think they knew the suspect.
The neighbors claimed that they were shocked by such an event in the village, which, according to them, is "clean and friendly".
In 31 C.E. Sophie Moorey-Brown "Press Association" said: "We live here for five years and have never heard of any bad events – it's always very quiet and nice to live here."
Royal Archives and the creators of the musical "Hamilton" will light the world about King Jurgis III
After the queen presented the project, which opened the huge archive of documents accumulated during the reign of George III, it was hoped that the letters, blogs and languages will help the public to get to know the king considered crazy much better.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – Royal archives have decided to cooperate with the Westend Museum.
The academics, who want to reveal the true face of the king, invited Jurgis III, who plays a role in musical "Hamiltons" to review the most important documents from the times of the reign of Queen Proproprosenel.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts available to a wider audience, so a large crowd of performance fans will be able to access digital documents.
The members of the royal family have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the duke and duke of Sasex will watch the performance twice, even though the ancestor of Prince Harry is constantly shown on the stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays a king in Vestende, said that the documents made me reflect and helped me to get to know the king whose image was formed by the musical "Hamilton", the film "King Jurgis madness" and the series for children "Shift Stories").
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after trying to reduce tensions with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and told his supporters at the meeting on Saturday that they had "in love" with letters after their correspondence.
Mr. Trumpas and Mr. Kim said that they would seek nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting held this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed their threats and insults, because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the US.
“I was strict like him.
We have always spoken," Mr. Trump said at the meeting in Western Virginia.
“And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, great letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos came to the semi-finals of the Greek Cup
The fourth prize of the Athens Panathinaikos Greek Cup celebrated the victory without the greater efforts of Luke Lekavich.
The Athenian team went the result 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) overcame the Prometheus staff of the Paters.
He spent 14 minutes in the square, gained 4 trails (2/2 div.), regained one ball and carried out one performance transfer and twice.
The most effective "Panathinaikos" class played Nick Calathes, who scored 15 points.
The spanner's cross to Shimonyte: everything was decided by the party's "crust."
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the in-house elections of Conservatives, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrida Šimonytė as a presidential candidate.
"The "democracy" festival itself was still strange, to put it mildly, when the party cream, the summit decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate had no chance of winning even theoretical," S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the government
"Conservers have appointed their candidate, we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
A nominated Prime Minister of the State Green said that I. Šimonytė should be appreciated by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
Mr Skvernelis does not comment yet on whether he will take part in the presidential election himself.
The Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of the governing "states", called the Conservative Elections a "failed experiment" due to the poor participation of the parties.
"First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the members of the party participated, with only around 20 thousand voters in total.
Knowing what money should have been spent to organise these elections, it is also clear that it failed," R. Karbauskas said to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think that the cost would not justify the result, because the result is no one, the party decided that their candidate was such - it's all right, but for someone to spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections weekend, 79% of the Conservatives' party members and their supporters voted for Mr Šimonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries laugh at Estonians: one area can change everything
According to the study conducted by Baltic Salary Survey this year, the main increase in wages was in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia lag behind their neighbour, according to the press release of the company.
"After listening to 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we see that the monthly salary before tax in Lithuania grew by 81.8% of employees and an average increase of 7.7 percent and annual salary with supplements of 10.5 percent.
Latvia has slightly overcame us - a little more annual salary has risen here, but like Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country", says Povilas Flusius, a representative of the company organising the research on remuneration and adds that the general economic indicators of the country, which dictate them, should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, the fastest growth in wage growth
Although in Latvia and Estonia wages rose to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages grew by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached slightly more than in our country – 11 percent.
In Estonia, this year's salary rose by 73% and on average 13 percent.
Changes in workers also have a significant impact on wage developments, since those who change jobs can earn much higher wages than in the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary has increased by 8.8 percent, which is more often than in other Baltic countries.
In the neighbouring Latvia, the annual increase in remuneration for such employees amounted to only 3,6 per cent.
Estonia remains the leading player in the Baltic States, not only as an average for new, but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change either their jobs or their duties, the pay has risen faster here: monthly - 6%, annual - even 9 percent, including the additions.
According to the remuneration survey specialist, such trends are often dependent on whether they go hand in hand with the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, national monetary policies, prevailing market sentiments.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic downturn encourage more careful behaviour and investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors in the country, such as information technology, construction and pharmaceuticals, can also rest on general statistics and overshadow smaller developments.
The biggest tax burden on Latvians
When comparing wage growth, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the highest proportion of taxes depending on pay – even 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42,4 percent for more earners.
For example, Lithuania has a constant 24 per cent rate, so with higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can have the same or even lower perceptible growth than in Lithuania.
A similar tax rate is applied in Estonia as in Lithuania - 23,6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable labour taxation in the Baltic States.
In the IT field - the most competitive salaries
According to the survey, in all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of duties, the position of IT specialists remains among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade is that the market indexes for positions in this area are among the lowest, so workers earn lower than the market average.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest wages grew for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
This year's increase in remuneration did not stop some of the IT positions – a significant part of the organisations' information security specialists' monthly salaries increased to 14 percent.
At the same time, wages remained almost unchanged in retail trade.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems, which has led to an annual salary increase of around 2 per cent due to bonuses.
According to remuneration specialists, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the need of the most demanding specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande again suffers: A former fiancée continues to laugh
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson, who is destroyed, pours out his pain by making jokes about their two relationships.
With the participation of the Saturday Night Live, he chose to make a joke about how he is falling into a serious relationship too quickly.
Fans say it's true, because just three weeks ago Ariana and Pete cancelled their engagement, which took place only a few months later.
Pete tried to create scripts that mentioned his failed relationship, but that would appear a little later on screens.
There is rumors that a humorist who has been admiring his former relationship irritates Arian himself.
Such jokes are painful to her and not to her heart.
At least in this way, the foreign news portal was told by secret sources.
White or Brown: which sugar to choose is recommended by a dietologist
White or brown?
Which sugar to choose?
The survey in the supermarkets revealed that although Lithuanians still traditionally choose white sugar, it is surprising that many people of the country give up this ingredient, which has been mentioned in the white death.
That brown sugar sales are growing in secret too by representatives of the supermarkets.
According to the representative of "Maxima", brown sugar is becoming more popular and countrymen are buying it more and more, although conventional white sugar is still the preferred one.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialised organic shops.
One of the most popular products there - coconut sugar.
According to nutritionologist Dalios Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful health effects can both have.
"Red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, it is harmful to the body if it is used in excess," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
If you are a sugar - free person, a dietist advises you to reduce the amount of sugar in your daily life.
By doing so - the benefits of everything - will fall and unwanted kilograms will improve health and health.
During the month consistently using less sugar, it will be easier to give up and completely.
"Every habit we create in about a month's time, so after doing such an experiment, let's say, a month's time for some sugar-free product - coffee or tea - we'll see how positive it will work and I think that everyone can give up a little bit of effort," says an ideologist.
Doctors claim that the white death of sugar is not unnecessary - the abuse of sweets can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to keep it as low as possible, especially since it is added to many foods, even bread.
Another step of "Lietkabelis": Lipkevičius lends to another LKL crew
Panevezys "Lietkabelis" team said goodbye to Vytene Lipkevičius - the attacker is borrowed by Prienai "Skycop" crews.
In this Betsaf-LKL season V.Lipkevičius dropped 6.4 points within 22 minutes, regained 2.8 balls, carried out 2 successful transfers and collected 8.5 utility points.
FIBA Champions League 29 years old 198 cm tall athletes statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 pick up ball, 1.5 score and 4.8 score in 21 minutes of game.
In the near future, Litkabelis will announce a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
S.Buškevics joined the coach staff
Sandis Buškevicas, the chief coach of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis", Nenado Chanak, became an assistant to Lithuanians.
In the 2005-2006 season, 41 Latvian played in Vilnius "Lietuvos Rytas" and in 2014-2017 worked in this club system as a chief coach assistant.
Last season, S.Buškevics trained the Jekabpils Jekabpils team.
The sport director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babrauskas to the staff, but he is going to continue his career as a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevicius also received an invitation, but it was not possible for both sides to reach an agreement.
S.Buškevica will work with Robertas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružs at the "Lietkabelis" coach staff.
The Latvian will join "Lietkabelis" on Tuesday and will be on "Cido" Arena at FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but on the bench we will not get out of it yet, because registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
The reduction in biofuels will not please everyone
In order to reduce the prices of biofuels, more deciduous trees will be crossed in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is what the aim is to "effect" the prices of biofuels.
"We have large accumulations of certain types.
We have to balance....
There is a concentration on soft leaves, because this can also have some effect on biofuel prices," K. Navickas said in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20%.
According to the Minister, next year pines will be cut as much as this year, and spruces will be cut as much as 80 hectares.
According to him, in Lithuania wood fell more due to favourable natural conditions.
"The next year, it shouldn't be," said K. Navickas.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800 thousand ha are private.
Combating food prices - a dubious obligation: encourage buying only in your own area
Among the measures put forward by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, it is proposed to state institutions and organisations to purchase 50% of food from local producers, publishing news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies could also be supplied to the buyer by local companies that won the tenders," the Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevičius, President of the Meat Processing Association, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs, and it would also be difficult to control the use of laws by pedagogues.
Valdas Sutkus, Head of the Business Confederation, also criticises the measure of inconsistency.
Macron calls on Europe to defend itself against Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Tuesday for the creation of a 'real European army' with the potential to protect against Russia and even the United States.
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a joint European Union force since his arrival in power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
Recently, he has gained a solid argument when U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from an important Cold War Treaty on the nuclear force.
'We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States', Mr Macron said to Radio Europe 1.
This is the first interview given to his radio from the beginning of his work in the President's post in May 2017.
'When I see President Trump announces that he comes out of an important disarmament treaty created after the rocket crisis that struck Europe in the 1980s, who will be the main victim?' said the French leader.
The aforementioned missile crisis was caused by the ongoing non-strategic nuclear expansion race at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was the main factor that led the US and Soviet Union to conclude the Middle Nuclear Treaty (INF) in 1987.
'We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army,' said Mr Macron by an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verden in north-east France, during the President's visit this week to the battlefields of World War I before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in a situation where Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated that there is a potential threat... we need a Europe that better defends itself, not just dependent on the United States.
The French President has become the main initiator for the project to set up forces from nine European countries capable of a rapid joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The Defence Ministers of these nine countries will meet for the first time in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the details of how these forces will function.
The European Union is also committed to a significant increase in its defence budget from 2021 onwards and to a total of EUR 13 billion in research and development of new technologies over seven years.
The current EU defence budget is below €600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alamar of the French military school of high-ranking officers said that the vision of Macrono about the closely unified defence of Europe is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between Europe's defence, which Emmanuel Macron is dreaming of, and reality is a great deal of disagreement between European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we are not idiots
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to join forces at the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to fear, by deploying bases in Poland or something else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, in particular missiles," said the state news agency Belta, which met a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
'Recently - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have developed our missile industry and we have produced our very precise (traceable) missile weapons,' the President said.
Last week, Lukashenko stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to plans to build a Polish base and to name it the name of U.S. President Donald Trump fort.
"Of course, we're worried about this.
If, let us say, in Poland, they say they are prepared to spend millions of dollars in order to deploy there some kind of Trump fort, of course, we are not idiots, and of course we are reacting to this," said Mr Lukešenka, when he took part in the discussions of the Main Group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
'Supremely, with our main ally (Russia), we are discussing how we can respond to all this and how we can find an appropriate response at a minimum cost,' he added.
The Western relations with Moscow were greatly lost as a result of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014.
Their contacts are also being trampled by Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and, this year's March in Great Britain, by an attempt by the special services of Russia to poison the former double agent Sergey Skripal nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington became even worse in October when Mr Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that that step could undermine the security system of the world.
A man who carried out a violent execution revealed how he killed his wife an extortioned footballer
Brazil was crushed by a gross crime that resulted in a brutal execution of a footballer named Daniel Correa Freitas.
The sportsman was killed during the 18-year-old girl's birthday.
A 24-year-old football player was found dead in Parana, Brazil, in the south-east.
He is reported to have been executed: Genitals are cut down, and severe injuries in the neck area are also reported.
The 38-year-old Edison Brittes Juniore, who killed the footballer, claimed that he had done so because he raped his wife, Cristian Brittes.
The Brazilian man who had carried out a homicide later gave a detailed picture of what had happened at night.
"The evening had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife, Cristianos, anywhere for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
And I broke the door without waiting, and saw Daniel lien naked in the bed, and my wife, and asked for help.
I was deadly mad.
Together with my friends at the party, we pushed him outside into the car.
Here I had a knife, with whom I ate my wife's raped husband with death.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything for myself at that moment," said the murderer.
Together with his friends, he threw a dead footballer’s body near the river, where police officers are looking for the main tool of bloody crime.
The civilian Brazilian police detained E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated his birthday.
It is said that police officers investigating the event are still lacking evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
True, recent footballer's messages and photos on the occasion of WahtsApp can help with the investigation.
A football player sent two pictures to one of his friends through WhatsApp, where he remembers himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out later, is murderer's wife, Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various rooms of the house.
I'm gonna eat my mother, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the football player wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the Sao Paulo Club, was lent in the second season according to the capacity of the Brazilian league of Sao Bento.

Paul Walker’s brother and wife repeatedly said that her daughter meant everything to the actor.
He was very proud of her.
The fans of Ostin Payers lost their heads, waiting for another part of the film
The cult comedy "Ostin Pauters" has admired millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, laughing shots and costumes are still being inspired by many fans.

Juliette Lewis will join the "Conersai" series created by "Rozan"
The stars of "Millions of Particles" and "Rating" of the series Juliette Lewis confirmed that they joined the series "Coners" created by "Rozan".
‘Yes, that's true.

According to Hollandwood Reporter, Lewis will play Galeckis girl Blue, but it is not clear how many series they will appear.
The "Conkers" debut is scheduled for October.
The ratings of the series that returned this spring were high and renewed for another season, but its creator and star Roseanne Barr were also released in May because Twitter shared a racist joke about the former Obama administration officer.
Most of the initial Rozana team, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman, will play at Konersas.
"Showtime" cancelled the series "I die here" two seasons later.
"Jim Carrey's produced showtime drama-comed "I die here" is cancelled after two seasons.

I loved her novel, and the adaptation reveals even more outstanding things," Green said in the statement.
“It was very nice to adapt the novel to the television and I am happy to work with the amazing artists of different fields,” said Catton.
“Roman is written in isolation, and writing the script is undoubtedly a teamwork and I am very glad that the world of “Slights” has expanded and become richer than I could not imagine.
It's great that everything will be led by the wonderful Claire McCarthy, and I can't wait to see how this great team will play this story."
Hurts Alabama can no longer use suspension
Alabama's spare player Jalen Hurts will not be able to be suspended for this season after Saturday.
Hurts is included in the highest ranking Crimson Tide Saturday match against the weaker Louisiana team, which is the fifth player's match this season.
The NCAA has applied a new rule this year – the player who has participated in four matches can be suspended.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts planned to do so because of the controversial play of assessments and team coach staff's response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban claimed that he was still planning to use Hurts skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama enter the matches on the national champion title against the Georgia team, but in the second half was replaced by Tagowayoa, who contributed to the victory of Crimson Tide 26:23.
The former South-East conference attacker Hurts started the last 28 matches of Alabama and entered the season with a record score of 26:2.
During the first four episodes of Crimson Tide on Saturday, Hurts completed 22 of 31 transfers, ran 276 yards, scored four times and took over one ball.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Desas must sign contract immediately
Des Bryant, the former attacker of the Dalai Cowboys, claimed that he was about to return to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Glory Museum, said that it would be more appropriate for Bryanto to be quick.
In response to a question asked by Twitter when he was going to sign a contract with the team, Bryant announced on Friday a single word "Twitter": "Short soon."
Three times selected for the Pro Bowl matches Bryant is not a member of any team since he was dismissed in the middle of April by the Dallas Cowboys dispute.
Bryant, who might not have signed a contract with Baltimore "Ravens" and was constantly associated with Cleveland "Browns" just before the season, said that he wanted to improve before signing a contract with the team.
In August, Owens, who is still talking about returning to the NFL, told the site TMZ that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
“He has to join the team and prove to everyone what he can,” Owens said to the site.
“All surveyors believe that he is no longer successful and that he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he has to get into the team for any salary, accept a one- or two-year contract – which is totally irrelevant – and show everyone what he can."
Bryantas in the Dalas team in 2017 69 times caught the ball, ran 838 yards and scored six times.
In 29 years, the player did not run 100 yards in his career – 23 competitions.
After signing a five-year contract worth $70 million in 2015, Bryant did not run 1000 yards for any season and did not catch more than eight points of score.
"If the director-general or the owner thinks that your skills are getting worse, you can't guarantee or raise the amount you want," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryant had to get to the team as soon as possible, because later it could fail at all and said that it would be possible to return to the Cowboys that survived difficult times.
"Of course. I don't know if their relationship is damaged," Owens said, who 38 times earned points for three seasons playing in the Dalas team.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys takes it back and he gets the chance, it's good for Des and franchise."
Suspected establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
Representatives of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), who visited Kaunas last week, appreciate the opportunities to set up a CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where companies receive aid for commercialisation of CERN technologies, for the development of innovative products and for adaptation to societal needs.
Although Lithuania has only become a member of CERN last year, the establishment of this organisation's business incubator in the country has already been suspended.
CERN representatives visited the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institute of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering in the "Santakas" Valley.
At the meeting guests and representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, the Lithuanian Energy Institute, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Economy and business discussed about the Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because if the CERN business development centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's scientific and business innovators.
"This incubator would promote the application of the knowledge and technology accumulated by CERN to important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used to diagnose and treat diseases and treat large data," says Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, research and innovation pro-rector of KTU.
CERN incubators, like other business development centres, provide support for business development by providing information and expert advice on adapting technologies to product development and helping to find sources of financing.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such a centre would include experts from various fields: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
CERN is best known for the Switzerland’s largest Hadron Counter-Ticker (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
However, CERN is not only conducted in quantum mechanics, but also in other areas, from cryogenics (very cold exposure to substances) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and research work have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus degtinė" has a new manager
The producer of beverages, AB "Vilniaus degtinė", appointed Rokas Mituzas as new CEO, who will replace Raimonds Pilke in this position.
Since last summer, Mr Pilė will continue to act as Director of Finance of Vilnius Vodka, according to a report distributed through the Nasdaq Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituzas is the co-founder of the company "Buga LT", which produces sauces, indicated in his "Linkedin" account.
2012-2017 Mr. Mituzs served as a regional director in the SPI Group, previously working in the Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
"Vilniaus degtinė" finished in the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315.500 EUR.
Last year the company earned 392.300 euro profit in the relevant period.
The sales revenue of the company, excluding excise duty, amounted to EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13.16 % compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people work in the Vilnius Vodka.
STT detained R. Ača - Business news
Former Parliamenter and former director of the Raseiniai district municipality administration, Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He's under arrest.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that officials of the Šiauliai Board are conducting pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in Raseiniai district municipality.
"Being Director of Raseiniai district municipality administration, R.A. (Remigijus Ačas - red. post.) is suspected bribery.
The circumstances are examined due to the unclear implementation of the public procurement, R. A. as director of the municipality - a possible exceptional advantage to one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with a company managed by the Raseiniai district municipality.
It is suspected that Mr A. has accepted a high-value bribe (over 250 MSL) for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is the "Raise Bus Park".
On Monday, the officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the head of the alleged company "Raseinių bus park" managed by the municipality of Raseiniai.
This was confirmed by the STT's press representative Renata Endrūžytė.
The STT report states that the allegations were also raised by two representatives of the companies who directly bought Mr Ača or who participated in the masking of bribes in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained and searched at their workplaces and at home.
The membership of the LSDD was suspended
Remigijus Ačas was for some time the director of the administration of the Raseiniai district municipality, but in April he lost his post.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr. Ačas was a long-time member of the Seimas, he was elected to the parliament from 2004 as a candidate for the party "Sturka and Justice".
However, in 2013 his and his party's knees were separated, and in 2016 he was not able to win his own mandate in the Seimas elections.
Now, Mr. Ačas is dependent on the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Shortly after the presentation of this news, the chairman of the LSDD, Kirkilas, informed the press that Mr. Ačas temporarily suspended his membership of the party until the investigation took place.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions of Remigijus Ačius are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to take all the necessary steps to be able to find out the truth.
R.Ačas suspended his membership in the party until pre-trial investigation," says Kirkilas, the leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, Mr. Achas was the head of a team of advisors to the then President Rolandas Paksas, who was subsequently expelled from office during the impeachment, on national security issues.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control Mr Ach's work
Neither the Mayor of the Raseiniai district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas said on Monday that he had no information about the particular purchase that law enforcement investigation might involve.
Meras Gricius said that he was apprehended by Mr. Ach from the media.
"I can't tell you, we were very separated by the functions, I was working as a mayor, he (R.Ača - BNS) - the administrative work, and I couldn't tell you what the reasons, whether this case was done for public procurement," the mayor said on Monday.
He also claimed that for the same reasons he did not wish to assess the former administration of the municipality of Ach.
I'd be afraid to say something about it, because I didn't directly control his administrative work, as far as I was presented for public procurement, for the tenders, said that there were such public procurements, such as that, and then what was visible in the public space, the contracts being concluded, that I already saw as a mayor.
So I can't tell you how he led the administration at that time as its director," said Mr. Gricius.
He said that he himself did not interfere in public procurement, nor did he influence them.
A new adviser in the culture minister's team
The team of advisors of the Minister of Culture Liana Rookytė-Jonsson was supplemented by Dr. Joseph Blakšėnas.
He will advise on archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management issues.
The Ministry of Culture reports that from 2016 until now he was the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, assistant professor at the Department of Music of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 students of VU Faculty of Communication elected Mr. Blažiuna as the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on preservation of cultural heritage and values.
It’s not stopping
The VŽ recalls that in May this year the team of Minister of Culture Rookytė-Jonsson was left by adviser Dr. Viktoras Bachmetjevs, who advised Minister on issues related to media policy, was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Vice-Minister for Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr. Rookytė-Jonsson said that the new vice-minister of her choice would fuel the same areas as Mr. Augustinavičius.
Currently, in addition to Mr. Augustinavičius, the team of ministerial advisors consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: 90 million euros of fines per business due to not functioning GPIS
Simonas Gentvilas, Vice-President of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, says that due to the poorly functioning Product, Packaging and Waste Accounting Information System (PPAIS) Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
"With the end of the year and without a normal functioning of the GPS system, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming an increasingly realistic scenario.
It is said informally that only 1% of the planned recycling tasks have been issued with certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste," Mr. Gentvilas states in the press release.
On 7 November, Mr Samuel initiated an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on the Environment to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not working, why the module of the programme is not actually being implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative changes, manufacturers and importers risk and get huge environmental taxes again at the end of this year," says Mr. Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and inaction of the accounting system for the GPSIS signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared with that of the Metroil.
Do not worry about tasks
Some experts also warn that some companies may fail to meet the national targets for recycling packaging waste for 2018.
When specialists see the first half-year packaging recycling indicators published by organizations, they confirm the reason to worry that some organisations may not manage the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some businesses might no longer be able to benefit from the pollution tax exemption and would receive a pollution tax on certain quantities of packaging that they have placed on the market each year.
The GOK wrote that two of the three producer organisations currently in operation rejected such concerns and one did not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, Director General of the Green Point of the largest organisation, said that at least formally it depends on whether the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Information Accounting System (PEIS) will be resolved.
The Green Point plans to overcome all kinds of packaging handling tasks this year, except glass.
Although it will not be possible to overcome the task of glass "Green Point" this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses that will be incurred as a result.
Experts doubt the benefits of food vouchers
Experts question the benefits of this innovation when the government plans to share food vouchers for the less well-off people and thus promote family or farmers' business.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are obsolete and will not solve problems, and the Government should focus on raising people's income.
"The system seems quite strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help society to acquire something or have more purchasing power, we need to direct all the capacity to increase people's income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy in one shop or another," BNS said Mr Dubnikov.
According to him, when proposing food vouchers, the Government would treat people with lower incomes.
"Behold, the people with lower incomes, like a voucher-based voucher, on which it would be written, we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be favorable to us.
It sounds like some pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them," the analyst said.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden, as it will need to monitor who and how it is allowed, and how it is protected from counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, Chief Economist of Swedbank, says that it would not be possible with one single instrument to achieve both objectives - to support low-income citizens and small entrepreneurs.
"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, the benefit of vouchers is to compensate for price differences and the population can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the price difference is to be compensated by the state from budgetary resources.
Then it's support for business, but not support for residents", - BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not fundamentally alter the competitive position of small shops, but rather create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it more difficult for new market players to come.
"Similarly, this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and for the population it would also be quite uncomfortable, they should not shop in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but look for a few specialized stores with a smaller range," said the economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries when there is a limited amount of goods or services and they need to be provided equally to all, or by some social group.
The residents then receive the coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market, providing temporary tax relief for businesses, employing long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice was successfully applied in Lithuania as well, as Mr. Matiulis said.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the new food coupon system under consideration by the Government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage small traders or farmers business.
The Prime Minister's Adviser Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, while buyers with coupons could get a 20-30 percent discount.
According to him, the number of coupons would be limited so that farmers would not be able to abuse them.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget does not yet provide for funds for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently planned or not foreseen in the budget will be in the final, yet he will change in the Seimas, so happens, can be transferred funds from one line to another, and from ministries, can change financing things.
There is always a battle of priority, what would be the decision - whether by renouncing, finding another additional source of income, etc.", – on Tuesday BNS said Mr. Malinauskas.
To date, it is decided to what extent and from when innovation can be applied.
