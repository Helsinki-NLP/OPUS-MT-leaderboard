New questions on the California water supply project
Critics and state legislators say that they want to know in more detail who pays for the 16 billion US dollar project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a representative of the leading California Water Supply Authority, that Brown's administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Authority may run counter to the state’s long-term claims that different local water supply authorities, not California itself, would pay for Brown’s vision of digging two equal 35 miles [35 km] tunnels to the south of the Strarament River, mainly for Central and Southern California.
The initial cost of building tunnels of USD 248 million, which still needs to be authorised by the supervisory authority, is already the subject of a federal audit study.
On Wednesday, the State co-legislators also commissioned a state audit on the construction costs of tunnels.
On Thursday, State Spyker Nancy Vogel said that despite the Los Angeles metropolitan water management account, no money from the State's general budget will be used to complete the current programming phase of the twin tunnels.
However, the opponents of the tunnels and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly representative, Susan Ega, one of the co-legislators of the state, who has been commissioned for this week's audit, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with bribes," said David Wolff, legal director of Howard Geervis's Taxpayers' Association.
In my opinion, it coincides with yesterday's audit: there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water management and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide a safer water supply for the Californians.
Opponents claim that they are concerned that the State will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Gulf, to the detriment of Northern California and to further endanger local species.
Metropolis and other water authorities, which are intended to receive water from the tunnels, still have to make a commitment to pay for them due to insecurity as to whether the massive investment will indeed provide sufficient water to repay it.
The same water authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project first obtained the permission of the supervising authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority states that "the State has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the programming phase will be provided from the state or federal budget."
After all that the local water authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water management, "is expected" that the state will use public money to complete planning," said Bob Muir, a speech by the Los Angeles water management.
He then directed the questions to Vogel, a state spy.
Vogel said that the State plans to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from the cost of the existing half a century old water network, the State Water Project.
However, opponents of tunnel construction point to a regulatory framework in 2009, which they say prevents the State from spending money on tunnel construction until the water supply authorities, which will benefit from it, assume payment obligations for them.
"The project contractor has promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patricija Šiferle, environmental consultant and ancient planned tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Addressing the China Cyber Security Law by the Business Group
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cyber security rules by warning that they will harm trade and will isolate the country.
The letter to Prime Minister Li Kecjan of China has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, demonstrating the global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that it could make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tiangin.
The Chinese leaders plan silent memory events to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tiangin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, an anniversary of such a disaster would be a moment that the people remember and remember.
But not in China.
Although the city of Taiign retains a memorial service to the memory of some of the dead firefighters, in other places such memorials are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party are told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as family members, are warned not to speak to a foreign press.
However, 23 - year - old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
"This anniversary, society should somehow know what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator at the military fire brigade, just a mile from the explosion epicenter.
"The call was received tonight at 22.53, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could come to the scene within 10 minutes.
Commands from other parts of the city also rushed to wipe out a huge fire in the chemical warehouse.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, well above the permitted quantities and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when it was allowed that the lot of nitrocellulose - chemicals used in nail varnishes - dries and then the summer sanitizes.
Then it spread into a vast area of 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
Windows and a fire station were bombed, where Zhang Mengfan was waiting for the radio attack news from the location of the event, and the roof was invaded.
This information was also not received.
"When I saw a mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of his 26 firemen sent to the explosion site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The greatest of the two great explosions was compared to the earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than USD 1 billion, including over 300 destroyed buildings.
In total 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The investigation authorities of the official government clearly blame corruption, political relations and official collusive agreements, which allowed circumvention and the disregard of security systems.
First of all, such warehouses should never have been brought closer to homes.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company’s management have been involved in some type of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress made - thousands of homes brought in order and compensation for citizens - these sensitive issues are still topical.
The tragedy has revealed a gap in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent monitoring is a fact.
That evening’s courage and sense of duty are beyond doubt. However, without a firefighter’s image as a hero, a rather satisfying scene appears.
It has a firefighter as a victim, who has been unbeatably sent to fight a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works in the fire service, but will attend the memorial church service in Tiangin.
He will send a message in his heart about his dead companions.
I would like to tell them the most: I have visited your parents and are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I'm going to do your son's duties.
Cold spring could affect the Scottish ruby shooting season
The Scottish rubles shooting season will start later, as the number of birds has decreased this year due to cold weather.
In several properties shooting has been postponed, since many of the young rubble have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
Noting the beginning of the season, the Association of Scottish Gaming Operators (SGA) says that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the Animal Protection Charity Fund OneKind calls for an end to the murder of 'brutal birds'.
Harry Houston, the director of the organization, said: "The work invested in providing a large number of shooting birds is huge and undoubtedly involves some kind of contentious activity."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary work enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
While the landowners insist that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that the shooting of rubble is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogg said that the industry provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the most remote regions and that it has been "rich" during insecure times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, the "hunting" culture is less rooted in Scotland, and part of the population does not know how shooting seasons affect the country economically."
Hog said that the number of jobs provided during shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Frandge Festival, the tattooing festival and the Old Year evening celebrations together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is quite worrying at the moment, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game operators and their families want to see the sector flourishing.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to make sure that those who work hard can rely on these jobs in the future.
According to RSPB Scotland, at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubble.
Many game operators admit that the shooting of rubles is not generally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day for the rubbing season is traditionally known as the "Holy Twelve."
However, there are still many discussions about this sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to persecution by some nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years, eight rounded golden eagles had disappeared in the mountains of Monadliat, southeast of Invernes.
According to the Nature Conservation Charity Fund, they have been unlawfully killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for Environment, Rosanna Kaningham, said that these reports are "very worrying and sad."
Mrs Kaningham instructed officials to analyse evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend of criminal activity.
A group of Scottish moors blamed the RSPB for trying to excite feelings of fire before the beginning of the rubble season, and said that there was no clear evidence that birds would even have killed in the Monadlit area.
Rio Olympics 2016: Brionia Peige United Kingdom wins silver tramplling
British representative Paige wins silver for tramplling
Brionie Peige has become the first British woman to be at the medal in the Olympics in a trampling attack by Rio fighting silver.
Peige (25) missed 0.425 points to gold because Canadian representative Rosanna McLenana won the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56.465.
World champion, Chinese representative Lee Dana was at bronze, while the second British finalist, Catherine Drisco, finished in sixth.
I can't believe I've fought the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said Emotional Paige.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the workouts and hard work had paid off.
I'm so happy that I could start at the finals together with Keta, one representative would be in the final, but we were there two.
Before the Olympic silver championship, Peidza’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Trampling was included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time British women managed to get to the end.
A medal reaction.
The British team representative Nathan Bailey, the only representative of men’s competition in tramplling on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hannah Velan, who participates in the second Olympics, quickly began to praise the achievement of Paige.
Paige has acquired a bachelor in biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate gold medal in rugby-7
A 12-year-old boy makes half a mile to see the game and the sugar cane fields to the nearest TV
Fiji begins an unprecedented celebration of its first Olympic gold medal in its history
Banks closed, shops shut down and the celebrators took over Suvas streets, dancing, singing and enjoying
Fiji won a gold medal at the Deodore stadium in rugby-7 final with 43-7 destroying the United Kingdom.
Thousands of people in the island country have stopped their regular work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal
Many fans were dressed in Fiji’s colors and rugby shirts, carrying the national flag and encouraging the team.
Singing the end of the game for a whistle, the thrilled singers went on the streets, enjoying and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the full streets of Suwa and joined the celebration with the flags of Fiji, do not turn to the slight congestion they caused," says Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue on the weekend and next week.
Prime Minister of Ireland: Finn Hards 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Mackenef took two first six months' punishments for his team in Finn Park.
Derry City has risen to the second one of the Prime Minister, gaining a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
Aaron Mackenef put in charge of the "fungal strip" by successfully implementing the two first half-life penalty strikes, which were awarded for violations against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boys hit the gate at the beginning of the second half of the year, and Schubert overcame the opponent in the fourth quarter before Keith Ward's late play, closing the enemy's ruin in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the crucial game Monday evening in Brendwell.
It was Derry's first victory over his north-west competitors in this season, and they were disrupted to me by the HARPS side.
Mackenef spared a hit at the game's discovery 17 minutes after Keran Cole's march against Schubert, although the violation turned out to be outside the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second blow of punishment, with Barie Molois, the former half-guard of the Caramel Strip, forcing Shubert to fall into the ground and Mackenef to get the result 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boyle set the exact point after Dean Jerry's game with his foot inside the eighth minute after the game was resumed.
Jerry City goalkeeper Gerard Dohertie had a peaceful evening but managed to protect the gate perfectly by overcoming David Scalley's guests in the best opening of the game.
Schubert put the ball past Col in 83 minutes, and he was soon followed by the Ward’s smart hit over Richard Brass, the guard at the Happ Centre.
It was Derry's greatest victory in the competition series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after mass unordered tests at Inverness College University of High and Island (UHI)
The entire 20 student course could have failed in the UHI college of Inverness during the highest media course test.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - olds who were hoping to use the mark they received in their studies to enter the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating this case.
SQA Press Secretary said that the 2016 highest media rating available throughout the country was "took as expected".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who had received training online, but often had to go to Invernes College from their places of residence, such as Ločeiber.
One student's father said that after his daughter's publications in social media that she had not received any evaluation of her work, at least 10 others also announced that she had not received any evaluation of her course work.
He said to the BBC News Scotland direct, that about five more people who had attended this course at Inverness College last year and who were able to communicate with, said that the same had happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept the offer of another university thanks to the qualifications obtained at the school.
However, her father said that there were others who also attended a media course organised by the college, who failed and who were now "forgotten" and insecure about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could enter universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of University of Highland and Island.
Diāna Rovlinsone, Head and Executive Director of Inverness College UHI, said: "We have the results of the exams and the success of students is very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of her Majesty Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved achievement levels in both further education and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we carry out an overview of all published results compared to those predicted by each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the evaluation body recently reported "significant improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
SQA Press Secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and a slight increase in A-C performance compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers placed in prison for samjurai sword "sin alcohol" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braden was attacked with a samurai sword, a knife and nunchaks
Two brothers in prison for killing a man with samurai sword after the drug-related theft in Airshire, which turned out to be "blood alcohol".
The victim Jason Braden (38) was intercepted in his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced for murder.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less serious charges of murder without a purpose.
When both men were sentenced, Judge Bill Danlop said to their brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
The judge Danlops added: "You are planning illegal entry together with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Braden may have been a drug addict, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After both men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police officer, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible action by John and James Clark has resulted in the death of Jason Braden."
At the age of 38, there is a heartbreaking situation that the family has to cope with in such terrible circumstances.
The court heard earlier that the brothers from Kilmarnoc decided to seize the gold bracelet they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both went under the influence of alcohol and drugs to his house, masked his faces with scarves, and armed with a knife and an eastern fight against the Nunchaks.
The sword used for murder is believed to have belonged to the dead.
The neighbors said that they saw Clarkas attack Braden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard him screaming.
Public prosecutor Richard Godard said in court: "The attack on this man was hard, chaotic."
Then the murder site was described as "blood alcohol".
In addition to the injuries from knife stains during the Braiden attack, there was a severe injury with a thick object.
Three days later, he died at the Kroshaus Hospital in Kilmarnoka.
Both brothers didn't confess in murder.
In providing evidence, James Clark, who had been tried 38 times before, including the murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it, it was an accident."
John Clark, who had been tried 23 times before, said that he just got involved to help a brother who he said was attacked by Braden."
A man was sentenced to a prison sentence for shaking and killing his baby's son
David Sinkler recognised his guilt in murder of a child in his home in Istkilbrid in 2012.
A man who searched and killed his baby’s children in an outbreak because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler searched the four-month-old Joshua when "for a while lost control" of their home in Istkilbrid, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was established only after judicial medical examination.
Syncler (34) was initially accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without a prior intention.
In the High Court of Glasgow, judge Lord Breiseidl Sinkler said: "You attacked your baby's son by shaking him, creating injuries from which he died."
When you searched him, you had to know it, but you didn't reveal it.
Only after thorough medical examination you will be able to recognise what you are doing.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breeseidle described the consequences of Joshua's death as a "catatrophic" for all and added, "Nothing will return Joshua."
In the past, the court had found that, on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Curtia, had gone with Joshua to swim and shop in Istkilbrid.
At 5.30 p.m., Curstium Sinklere went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who sounded like a shock.
He said to her, "Josh doesn't breathe like he does, just come home."
Then he finished the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to the Hermair Hospital where he died.
At first, Joshua’s cause of death was not clear, but he was looked at by a team of forensic experts who found the consequences of injuries that occurred shortly before his death in the eyes and brain, and such injuries could not be caused by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a child neurosurgeon at the John Redcliff Hospital in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been searched and has thus got injuries, as well as hurt with more force than every day."
Defence representative Jan Djugid told the court that Synkler "extremely repentant" of what he did.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone is at risk by Julia Jephimov
The British representative, Tatone, falls out of her hand in a 200-metre swim
The British representative, Chloy Taton, criticises the participation of the controversial swimmer Julia Jefimov in the Rio Games after the Russian representative overcame him on a 200-metre swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to play after a complaint concerning the ban on participation in doping, won silver, leaving Tatoni in fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be pure games," then said the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I didn't know who was there.
I am not satisfied with it, but it is.
Jefimova, who won second place, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sport, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to take part in competitions, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Caneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in the 2016 matches of Rio, overcoming Jefimov, who was at the silver medal.
Chinese representative Ginling This was at bronze, just six seconds ahead of the fourth one of the Tatons left.
Her British teammate, 20 - year - old Molly Renshova, finished at the sixth.
"Standing in the fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you're in front of," added Taton.
That is a great experience, and I am a little disappointed at the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, getting to the final is a great experience that I will take with myself for the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly seek a medal, so I hope I will get closer to it next time.
In the Taton, only 0.01 seconds behind the British record in the women's 200 m swimming final.
"Every man has to give a second chance," Jephimov.
Jefimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start at Rio.
In 2013 she was ordered a 16-month ban after her body had found the traces of anabolic steroids.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be denied participation in Rio because they have already been sanctioned in the past.
CAS dealt with my complaint and I won.
If someone does not like it and someone else has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I am not in favour of doping, and I have never used it.
In the latter case, it was definitely not my fault.
Every person must be given a second chance.
When you drive and you get a penalty check, no one puts you in jail.
Ben Plus wins a place for 50 free-style swimming
Prior to that, he set up a British record to win a place in a 50-metre free-style swimming final.
The Union champion Prus (21) had a distance of 21.54 seconds, no matter the fifth fastest qualified for the Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
India’s sports minister, Vijy Goel Rio, has been a rather striking personality in the Olympics, often seen in tribunals, encouraging Indian athletes and receiving selfies after their starts.
However, he and his large company seem to have provoked the anger of the Olympic game operators because of their uncontrolled behaviour, repeatedly trying to break down to the competition areas without proper accreditation and serious reaction, being tested by the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vyy Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to withdraw the game’s accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted accessible areas at the gymnastics competition venue and on the arena, where swiveling and swiveling took place.
"We have received several reports that your sports minister has tried to enter accredited competition areas with people without accreditation," says Sarah Peterson, continental manager of Rio 2016's Committee of organisers.
When staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, people together with ministers became aggressive and rude and sometimes missed our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of other cases of such behaviour, accreditation of your sports minister will be revoked and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be withdrawn," the letter was further mentioned.
The leader of the Indian delegation referred to this matter as a 'big elephant', and Goel himself said that he had not done anything wrong by writing it down as a 'misunderstood'.
On Twitter, he wrote: "How far do I know we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, these Olympic games are rather gloomy for India, so far there is no medal.
The lost fans in the social media indicated that Michael Phelps had won so many medals - 26 - as India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including shooter Abhinava Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained fourth.

However, there are still some bright expectations, as there will still be a race in boxing, golfing, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast Dip Carmara will compete for jumping on the finals on Sunday, showing his terrible double speed "Death Jump", Produnov's jump, which has been tried by only a few other gymnastics.
In India, a country of 1.25 billion people, the low number of medals won has always been a source of indignation.
Analysts say that there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for the Olympics - Carmara's first gymnastics tool was made from the spare parts of an old sculptor.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge about sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport are taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended India's Olympic Association for breach of its Statute in 2012 as it elected the leaders against whom criminal cases have been brought.
In sochi, the three participants in the Indian Winter Olympic Games were even denied to represent their country, to carry a flag, or to wear anything with the national symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people get injured, the JetBlue plane that has been searched for by the Turbulence on the Boston-Sacramento route is forced to land in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aircraft was forced to make an extraordinary landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the turbulent period, reports CBS Sakramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapidsittia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 in the evening after local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been brought to the hospital for checks.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the injured, and that a spare plane has gone to Rapidsitij to deliver the rest of the passengers to Sakramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses opportunity for medical marijuana
The answer is, unfortunately, that it is unlikely.
This is a lost opportunity, which can further delay the provision of treatment to countless people.
Until today, there is only one source approved at federal level for the scientific use of medical marijuana at Mississippi University.
In a slightly more positive report today, DEA also announced that it would now allow other sites to apply for the same authorisation.
There is hope that the amounts and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis in favour of the study, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available if access to it is still difficult, it has no great importance.
Imagine a product that is highly demanded but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to the demand for goods, someone makes a hard-to-understood decision to produce more, but never closes the door.
This product is marijuana and its presence on list 1 is the locked door.
In this unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
As marijuana is a listed substance in list 1 (i.e. it has not been defined as "medically approved and has a high potential for unforeseen use", there are significant obstacles to door disconnection.
Potential researchers usually turn to DEA first, as it grants permission to launch scientific research.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the investigation of substances included in Schedule 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up high-level safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of obtaining permission from its academic institution to carry out research on substances included in Schedule 1 above all.
Even if some representatives of the faculty wish to carry out this study, the university management may not want problems or some potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Suu Sisley was released from office after an effort to move medical marijuana trials forward.
She eventually had to seek private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, her project became the first medical marijuana trial approved by DEA to prevent post-traumatic stress to the veterans.
Then, after years of fighting the bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute for Drug Addiction has been at the key of the last lock.
At present, it is the largest federal state funding for the research of marijuana and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if research leads to a higher amount of medical medicine, the Institute will still have to approve all the studies it finances.
However, the problem is that of 'abuse' in its title.
Dr. Donald Eibram, representative of the University of San Francisco, interviewed my documentary "Marihuan", says that the main task of the Institute is to study substances in the context of their potential addiction, not as medicines.
He draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it causes.
Pay attention to: 1 434 works on medical marijuana were found at the US National Medical Library in the last five years in a quick (and, admittedly non-scientific) search.
In the same search, only 57 works benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies concerned the damage caused by marijuana, such as "A poor trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "The pancreatitis caused by marijuana" and "The use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportion creates a completely distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy, wherever the sight can be seen.
While DEA takes over the status of list 1, without considering medical effects, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains the cannabionide patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to set up marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with a high potential for dependence, although the main administrative judge of DEA, Fraensiss Yangs, opposed it.
In a strictly medical sense, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, feeding 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana to die.
Marihuan is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind in its natural form.
When properly analysed, marijuana can be safely used in medical treatment by appropriate monitoring.
Again, the judge of DEA himself has proposed this.
And yet in almost 30 years, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of this or not, we all accept some dose hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to make it loud or we're so confused or surprised that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As regards hypocrisy in the context of the federal medical policy of marijuana, there must be endurance in order to present the facts unwittingly.
Patients' lives, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by medical marijuana, and many others' lives depend on it.
The fact that a plant can bring so many benefits and still stay behind closed doors is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondas Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots are known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say that Trump dominates media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and I have Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," said CNN, founder of the electronic music pancake association The Bloody Beetroots.
The candidate for President of the Republic and the Italian media magnate, who became politicians, both known for their exaggerated personalities, their ability to attract the attention of the press and their transformed stories in the media.
In the composition of "Bloody Beetroots" Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, from legendary Sir Paul Macarthy to electropop singer Greta Swabo Beč in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love".
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which roughly coincided with the time when the pancake was born, and the figures "1977" are tattooed by a musician on the chest.
"English isn't my mother tongue, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black charge with which he is known.
I am trying to explore, and I have tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the Americans to watch the "Videocracy", a documentary that explores the Berlusconi monopoly on Italian media.
The documentary is about how "the Berluscones made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trump had a similar influence on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and bend everything... in his own," he said.
In my opinion, Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were imprisoned in over GBP 500 million on drugs
Two Turkish men have been sentenced to smuggling more than GBP 500 million on board a ship in the North Sea, each of which has been sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of trial in the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen on the MV Hamal board, three tons of Class A drugs were found.
Detention in 2015 is the largest load of cocaine seized in one run that has ever been seized at sea in Europe.
Mamine Sachin and Emine Osman were sentenced to prison for their role in a large-scale drug transaction
The huge drug load found on board is one of the largest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a special hiding place on a tugboat registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was suspended by the British fleet fregate "HMS Somerset" and border force boat "HMC Valant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozmens (51) is sentenced to 20 years in the Glasgow Supreme Court.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was "not only essential, but ambitious", and drug trafficking has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercially important operation, including the transportation of cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the ship's captain Sachin was not at the top of the "drug tree", but that he played a key role in the criminal offence, while the role of the second Captain Osman was "something less".
Inspectors climbed the Hamal deck, following encouraging information from the French customs office DNSED, and when it stood in Aberden, they drilled through a steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 containers of 3,2 tonnes of cocaine were found, the estimated value of which on the black market is 512 million pounds.
MV Hamal was tested last year by the Royal Navy.
Three tons of cocaine were on board.
Checking the ship revealed that it has accumulated tons of Class A drugs in ballast tanks
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was opened under the closet in one of the crew’s rooms and the gap was ceded.
Sachin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board during the period from 20 February to 23 April last year and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both unpunished men who worked in the shipping sector since leaving school continue to claim that they are not guilty, but still pass the sworn sentence.
There is insufficient evidence of appeals against four more men.
Sachin's lawyer Jonathan Crow said that married father of two children is a "glorified mule".
He said, "Somebody involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who's capable of running the ship.
Looking at the hierarchy of drugs, Sachin is certainly not at the top of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be taken off by a crane
The police went through the entire ship for days before the drugs were broken down into these boxes.
Sahina asked questions about his captain's work to Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krov said he was "shocked" about passing the events of an important daughter (9) and a son (13) and "just wanting to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since they were arrested in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain a visa endorsement.
Osmen's lawyer Di Murce said that he "wonderfully" wants to see his family, but knows that it will not "be possible" in the transparent future.
In response to today's judgments, the Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: 'There are no borders for international drug trafficking, and we are working more and more together to get one step ahead.
"Scotland's success in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have caused considerable economic damage to organised crime."
The drugs were stored in every gap on the ship, including under the floors.
These smuggling parcels were found hidden in the ship's laundry space by inspectors
Mr Harvey added: Hamal was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities and by rapid cooperation with the Prosecutor-General of Tanzania, where the ship was registered, who also permitted boarding on board.
"Our investigation then came from Guiana, which provided access to relevant data on shipments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the vessel's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the USA to put together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the extensive intelligence that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, British authorities in international waters could not climb on board without the permission of the Tanzanian Government - something that they had never allocated before.
Suu Petena, Head of the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CPS) International Justice and Fight against Organised Crime, said: "As a rapid and accurate response, the CPS criminal justice adviser managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board within 24 hours of receiving intelligence.
Under international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to climb in international waters on board a vessel under the flag of another State unless that State issues a special legal permit to do so.
Without our criminal justice adviser's rapid action, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the lost "Eastern Express" train
Photographer Brian Romejin of Rotterdam has taken pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
The images show the roaring inside of the train, the broken seats, the dust windows and the narrow driver’s cab.
It has already been named Eastern freight wagon, but it was owned by a Belgian national railway company
A city explorer has taken these remarkable photographs of lost passenger trains that were once one of the best ways to travel.
The days of flowers have long since passed, and the train car and the locomotives have been left to blow up the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular sightseeing object for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these terrible photos that show the raging inside of the train, broken seats, dust windows and a compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and the locomotives have been left to blow up the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular sighting for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The Belgian national railway company used the locomotives some 50 years ago.
126 years later, on the rails, the last train operating under the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous history phase.
The Eastern Express was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French word "Express d'Orient".
It became an Eastern Express in 1891, and by 1930 it already had regular routes across Europe.
This should not be confused with the private "Venice Simplin-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagons.
In this photograph, the narrow driver’s cab in which the equipment in the rust is still fitted with measuring instruments and open wires
Romejin said that the driver's cab is "in its own sense claustrophobic, and the locomotives' noise is probably unbearable."
The abandoned locomotives and wagons have become a popular sightseeing object for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeng MailOnlineTravel said: "I could really feel how it was used in its flower times."
For wealthy gentlemen, ladies join their beautiful dresses on their way in high hats.

Lankashir father is expelled from children's school for wearing a T-shirts with llamas
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day on the T-shirts with an offensive inscription.
Kieku Makbet (36) from the City of Battle in Lancashire says that he "in the case of an accident" was wearing a shirt with the inscription "Laiž and Dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his seed and put on the T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that he was prohibited from entering school territory.
The single father, who for four years worked as the Head of the Park Primary School in Colne, Childhood, could not come after children, and the staff even called social services and the police.
Cage Macbeth (36) of the Children says that he has not been admitted to the school area after having arrived on the offensive T-shirts on the children's day.
Mr. Childhood charges school principal Sarah Mijley for being too serious.
He says that he has been unduly punished for having drawn a T-shirts in a hurry before going to watch his two children's race.
A father who no longer works as a school leader said, "It was a mistake and carelessness from my side."
I don't think about sports day, and I rushed when I put it on.
We had a father's race closer to the end of the event, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologize and cut it to the other side, and the case ended.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the head of school that invited him to a meeting with the director the following day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the principal of the school called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," said Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after a sporting day, some parents on Facebook had been alarmed about it and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable person would say that it is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeta, who was editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that in his view he could not even come after children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this led to a call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt there was the image of Kreiga Charles Listers from the BBC cult comedy "Red Throat" with one of his iconic expressions "Laiž and Dr.am."
He commented: "I told them I wasn't there because I'm not allowed to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I was not behind my daughter.
The school also called the police, because I hadn't come after my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer come to school and that the ban will remain in force until further statements are made.
He also said that he was warned that he could be fined GBP 500 if it were caught in breach of this rule.
Sarah Mijley, director of the Park Primary School, said that the case had now been closed.
Sarah Mijley, Director of Park's Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeta has resigned from office and is no longer the head of our school."
This thing is now over, and I hope to return to the regular school life in September."
Jo Kooney, the town’s advisor to the child, said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We should all bear in mind that when you take such positions as counselor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately, this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Advisor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have imposed a ban on him and that an elephant had been blown out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added: "The wearing of this T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Lacashir police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not arrive.
The premises of the former factory VEF, located in the street of Brīvības, have recently been renovated - there are several IT companies living there, the sector has already begun to call this territory the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF area will also develop, including Berzaunes.
The development and construction of the 2nd stage project of the LU Academic Centre in Torņakalns will cost 21 million euros.
The procurement on the development, construction and author’s supervision of the second stage technical project of the Academic Centre in Torņakalns, Riga, announced by the University of Latvia, is shown on the website of the Procurement Monitoring Office.
Procurement has taken the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The agreement will be concluded with LNK Industries Group, which is committed to performing these works for 21 186 560 euros.
As the University explains, when starting planning and implementing projects of the European Union Fund for the 2014-2021 programming period, it continues the design, author surveillance and construction of the next series of the Academic Complex - the Science Centre building, according to the Skici project and the specified construction year.
The building of the Science Centre by its main activities is similar to the one designed and constructed in the 1st stage of the Academic Centre for Natural Sciences and its activities, which is similar in terms of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The Regulations of the Competition were accompanied by the Slicu project developed by SIA Sixth Style, which provided all potential suppliers with information about the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalne, including a list of planned objects of the University of Latvia Academic Centre, indicating the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of entry into service and other information.
At the end of 2015 SIA Sixth style made the site of the building complex of the University of Latvia in Torņakalns, previously designed, as a result of which the location and interconnection of the buildings of the Academic Centre was clarified, as well as the transport organization in and around the territory.
A competition shall be launched for cutting grass in the lanes of road compartments.
SJSC Latvian road maintainer has launched a procurement for mechanised lawn mowing in the lanes of the roads in the regions of Latvia and in Pierīga, informs LAU.
The object of the purchase is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rezekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga road areas.
Applicants may submit a tender for one or more lots.
The mowing of grass in the stripes of roads is necessary to improve the transparency of roads and areas adjacent to them, to promote the flow of water from the road, and to limit the passage and formation of grasses.
The most ambitious lawn mowing works for farmers are intended for a total of 28 roads in Talsi road area of 637 hiking kilometres, 20 roads in Valmiera road area of 432 hiking kilometres, and 17 roads in Alūksne of 384 hiking kilometres.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed the lawn mowing work on the main and most important regional asphalt roads of the country, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads the maintenance of the Latvian roads planned to entrust part of the mowing work to farmers.
"It is an opportunity for us to use more efficiently the funding allocated to road maintenance while allowing farmers to fully load their machinery and earn their income," says Vladimir Kononov, Chairman of the Board of the Board of the Latvian Road Administration of the SJSC.
The closing date for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Ombudsman: Demagogy on a compulsory model of health insurance with an additional financial burden on citizens does not pass any criticism.
Any demagogy is considered to be compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden of payment on citizens, without any criticism, according to the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons met today with the Minister for Health Andes Čakš to discuss the health situation.
After the meeting, Jansons told journalists that the model of sector financing proposed by the Minister of Health is sustainable and developed health care systems, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case additional funding for health care was needed, as it was not enough at the moment.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden of payment on citizens, does not withstand any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is invoked.
Jansons said that the Netherlands devotes 11% of gross domestic product to health, while Latvia accounts for only 3%.
So the government and the parliament must be sufficiently responsible to realise that from this point of the freezing must rise, said the Ombudsman and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should get to the doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister indicated that with an additional EUR 35 million planned, only the most acute cases regarding oncological patients and the remuneration of maternity specialists will be possible next year.
As a result, the VM has drawn up a plan and has submitted a request for an additional €41 million in healthcare to reduce the number of teams and investigations.
"A question about the priorities, whether it will have any resources or not," said Čakša.
This amount does not, however, include an increase in medical pay.
Commenting on the fact that medical practitioners are not excited about the fact that all three options of the Health Care Financing Model are being driven by the government for consideration of the VM, including the one that provides for additional payment to patients, Čakša said that by moving all three models, the government was given the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that it is possible to clearly demonstrate that Latvia is not prepared to impose additional burdens on the population by moving all three models.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the model of health care financing, which does not involve an increase in the overall tax burden, however, requires that part of social tax be shifted to health, according to the summary of the conceptual report "On Change of the model of financing of the Latvian health care system".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best option of the model of health care financing would be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local watermelons are ready.
Watermelon this year, says Rolands Dambis, the owner of Arjus in Grobiņa municipality Medzze parish.
Watermelons are already available on the Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have begun production, but late tubers are well abandoned, reports the Regional Newspaper Course Time.
"This year watermelons grow better than last year", says the grower of big berries in Rucava district Artis Kusis.
In weather terms, this is also a much more favorable summer than the previous one, when it was cold and windy.
Guest shows of Liepaja Theatre in Riga have started.
On August 12 and 13, Liepaja Theatre will visit the Daile Theatre in Riga, offering performances nominated for the Playman Night Award, as well as a bright intrigue – production by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herberts Laukštāna, and the "Delfi" portal is informed by the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, the audience will be shown the human drama "Zilņimans" by the director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Merrick - who lived in London in the Victorian era and was called a Blueman because of his maze, the deformed body of an inherited disease.
The titlelom is represented by the actor Egon Dombrovskis, who has received the nomination "Yet Actor of the Gameman" for the representation of Merik's role.
As critic Normund Akott described his performance, Merik is "a role spent through the heart" in which the birth image is not repeated."
On 13 August, the exhibition "Portreti" will be offered to viewers.
The performance has received six nominations of "Playman Night", including "Show of the Big Form of the Year".
The director has created his work as a unique gallery of portraits, giving equal importance to every image of the ceiling, so each of them has a centre and a background.
The performance consists of a series of mini-impositions that end in a single whole.
It is an observation of the nature of man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and a cold calculation, revealing how a man changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, which, because of its greed and goodness, breaks the surrounding, sometimes the sheep, which is broken by someone else.
In both of these dates, the "Man who drives away from the elevator" show by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herberts Laukštēna will be played in the direction of Gaļina Poliščuka.
It is not a sad but humorous story of how the elevator becomes the only friend of someone.
Despite the sterilistics of the cemetery, which dominate the performances in the visual image, the dominant intonation of the work is still bright and even optimistic.
"The man who avoids the elevator" is not about the decision of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems that there is nothing about it", the critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the performance.
Tickets can be purchased at "Biļešu paradīzes" box offices and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serial, but a real life.
Olga Zelika, the owner and investigator of Riga Detective Agency, is expecting me halfway through the road.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression.
Dressed in white panties and white jacket - a very elegant woman who beats all my ideas about what a woman-detective should be.
She's waiting for me with a champagne woman, and I'm kindly giving up.
I'm telling you that I was addressing her, because I thought it was interesting that a woman was doing something so unusual.
It has always seemed to be men's work.
Olga has a higher legal education - Master's degree.
He used to work in the criminal police.
He realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his own business.
That's enough knowledge.
"In the police I really didn't want to go back," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There in the criminal police, we investigated things, we collected information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of Riga Detective Agency."
She calls for the anniversary celebration: "There will be no drinking."
They're all promising people.
Asked about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that working in the team was sometimes dangerous.
It's a business that, if someone does not work professionally, can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, then we are the second.
Of course, the sphere is not simple.
Many are trying to get us into a relationship because we're engaged in the fraud of our mates.
That's what people think!
Many come and require, or can put listening equipment, attract dogs.
Many have seen the movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's information gathering," Olga says.
If there is a crime by law, I have to warn you about it.
We make green tea and laugh, so there's at least a cup to stick to and stir up conversations.
I've had a client whose husband was constantly hit.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a manic.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then begins.
"It's the worst of all," Olga says.
Psych is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a animal.
This can end bad.
Don't give it to God, with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People are becoming victims at some point.
"Many women are trying to get away from their families and then come back again," she says.
I refused the last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," reveals Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
"His husband beat his son and made him disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has an instinct of her mother and, first of all, she has to protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to get rid of that man.
There are people who are possessed with revenge.
The worst thing is that Mother looked at it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We could not find a body, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't do anything without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who don't have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or family divorces and information needs to be collected.
Finds out what is the party to the fault.
The last thing I have had was on the subject when my friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting, because once men were smashing, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "put" friends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women should be careful when travelling abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and too trusted," Olga believes.
There have been cases of couples going abroad to marry a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long height, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different man.
"I pulled him out," Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
Asked what is the most unusual thing you've faced, Olga says: "Everything is special, but the most difficult thing is where trust is used."
When a friend "put" a friend.
You borrow and don't give back the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other is to be," Olga says.
The situations in which we deal with mistrust are quite crazy, because women are often not ready to resolve the situation.
They are not prepared to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use wealthy married men.
One man who followed his wife said that she couldn't have a favorite because all the wives had cheated on her.
"He was married three times," Olga remembers.
Well, then there's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on her.
Olga relates to a woman who left her husband and asked him if she had raised her hand.
In fact, I'm constantly hitting him, he's answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
It seems interesting to me how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and the spouse shown if there is evidence of fraud.
How does this happen?
"Parallel to detective work there exists protection of personal data," Olga tells.
That is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other does nothing.
We may take such photographs and videos for personal interests, but no public view.
If material that does not comply with the law is presented to the court, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, education and experience are not enough, mental well-being and meeting the criteria must also be met.
We don't take fingerprints, the police do it.
I tell my clients - disconnect from the series, here is real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, they also had to use dogs.
"Narcotics can't do without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in connection with the murder investigation, but I don't like taking such things.
These are very difficult things.
There are now more and more male clients, as women tend to laugh at men.
At one time, it was different.
Now women have fun, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, decent people suffer the most," the Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start real life.
We all know that if you hit one face, you turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that's unpleasant to you.
This cannot be done.
We must not be afraid of losing the things that interfere with life!
You can't become a little hysterist, and what happens to us is what we allow ourselves to do.
Yes, my first thing was directly related to her husband’s distrust when she was not prepared to accept the fact that her husband cheated her.
She always called and asked her what to do.
"I now ask all the clients if they are ready to accept the situation when they find out that a man really cheats him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and wage a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but a real life.
I'm also a necessary specialist.
It is a heart case and associated with Japanese medicine - hand treatment.
This is a very interesting thing.
Why have I started working on this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm yourself down somehow.
Reiki not only calms, but restores energy, lights.
"People leave my office positively and satisfiedly," Olga says.
She has needed signs in her office at the wall, and Olga says that they write not with the brush, but with the fingers.
I didn't just get there, the book on need fell in my hands literally.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
Learn more about it here.
The olive also sings.
It's her free fun.
We're all driven by creativity.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smiling, but I have to rest to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, I need alcohol.
Alcohol sinks.
In the police, it's a lot of use because the work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sport and needs.
I've been doing tennis for 15 years.
I also liked horse riding.
I shut down in nature, write articles, I'd like to write a book.
Detective work has a fine border when work enters your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be allowed into life," she says.
Asked how to combine work with private life, Olga says, "My beloved man is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
It must be the most true love in my life.
It's enough for me to think about him, and I already feel better.
Detectives usually do not trust, but he has accepted my job.
In fact, I separate my work from my private life.
I haven't even got into this business.
Reiki has led me.
When I was a child, I saw more than anyone else.
Thanks to the needs, an intuition is opened.
There are many detectives, but the real ones are few.
In any case, it's working with the brain and it's hard to turn off.
You also need rest.
"Other than you, you can't get back," Olga admits.
The most difficult case I've been working on is the Constancy story.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man literally laughed about that woman.
I did so that the child and his mom left for England, away from danger.
There were no other options.
We must not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to be happy about every day that we have.
Thank God.
Three good things for someone else every day.
You need to do a good job or a day for yourself.
We shouldn't do this to men.
It's a big mistake.
I have to understand that we have a man next to us, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If not, turn around and go away.
You can go to church, it's been a great help to me.
Don't be fanatical, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change unless you change, leave and change your life.
Under no circumstances should you put yourself and your children in danger.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
People are created to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already in need and are not in vain in this world.
Never sit on the ground!
How to prepare better for family photo shoots.
The summer is still in full swing, as soon as possible, the next school year, which families may inherit in their memory.
For everyone to look happy and beautiful in their photos, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
The advice "Ihappymama" is given by a large-scale mother Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It must be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
The study makes it much more difficult for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Aleksandra says that she chooses clothes for all six family members so that the clothes are in no more than three colour shades and as few inscriptions as possible on the clothing.
Don't forget about a good mood.
Have fun, joking, playing, but never shouting or psycho, if the children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here's the next tips already sound from the full of professional photographers!
You need to understand what exactly you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, deaf children and an ideal family picture, for others - "life is what it is", that is, the desire to see real, true emotions in the pictures, or, as the photographer loves to say himself, "refuge back", "open eyes", "surprise nose".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you need to understand that it is just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you get stuck, the better.
You are yourself - there's neither a firm mom who works, is ready to eat, is bringing up, and still does so, nor a father who's always talking on the phone, ever.
And not the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to embrace one another, to smile at your own and to have fun.
And then the photographer's task will be to capture the true moments of emotions between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show what has happened, listen to his advice in choosing clothes, for better shots.
Put on and clean all the clothes you need in advance so you don't have to do it any more on the day of the photo session.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially when taking photos at the studio and the time is limited).
If you have little children, choose a time for photo shoot that corresponds to the day-to-day regime so that it doesn't happen at the time when your baby normally sleeps the day.
And, of course, do not forget to take with your children food, cookies, water and favorite toys (to use them only in extreme situations).
It's ready for your dad that he might have to take off his socks, but it's not usually written in such tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, says Marina.
Do not drink much water before the photo session and lie down well before that.
And it would also be advisable to have some entertainment together after the photo session.
Go to the theme park, eat some ice cream, have fun with skateboards - which the family more likes.
That way, at the same time, you will have excellent pictures and pleasant memories of the day you spend together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: Raising a minimum wage - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The issue of raising a minimum wage in public debate has almost the status of a saint cow: either to support promotion or to mention any non-speaking, general phrases.
In view of the considerable increase in the risk of stagnating the economy (as soon as we avoided the technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality, bring Latvia's wages closer to the Western European level and fill the state budget with one hint.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than the benefit, because it undermines the competitiveness and employment of enterprises, especially in sectors and regions with low incomes.
At the first moment it seems that despite several increases in minimum wages in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising the usual few dozens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture appears if we compare it with the average wage in the country (%) – the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since in Latvia the share of the minimum wage earners is significantly higher than in the neighbouring countries (in Latvia - 17%, in Lithuania - 11%, in Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar increase in the minimum wage is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the Latvijas Banka Business Survey, each fifth Latvian company replied that increasing the minimum wage in the beginning of 2014 was important or very important to increase the prices of products.
This means, firstly, that the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvian residents); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness both on the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports were encouraged).
Due to lower competitiveness and smoking production volumes, it was important for almost every 15 Latvian companies to lay off their employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost one in eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011 - 2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if each fifth company pointed to productivity improvement as important when assessing the increase in the minimum wage for 2014, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the fourth increase in the minimum wage in turn could be expected to increase productivity).
Another important result is that because of the rise in the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees earning more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the effect of the minimum wage was significant even for companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation).
A further increase in minimum wages, which is not justified by productivity gains (even though overall the rather low level in euro), will have a negative impact on companies' competitiveness and employment.
The analysis of economic averages is not enough to assess the validity of the minimum wage.
Consideration should also be given to whether raising minimum wages is "intolerant" in sectors and regions where minimum wages are most commonly used.
Results of the Bank of Latvia survey show that the largest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19; 25%).
At the end of 2013, in the industrial and services sectors, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may rather harm by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the resilience of the shadow economy.
Some signs show that the real increases in minimum wage in 2014-2015 (by 27%) have slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there are no regions in Estonia and Lithuania that would be so far behind average wages from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Tauragė region, but there also the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average wage (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage could reach 58 % in 2016.
The call made from time to time to raise the minimum wage to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification and is not feasible in the short and long term.
Firstly, such a high figure from the average wage, or even so close to it, is not present in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in a number of economic sectors (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering and veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector in Latgale.
Increasing the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently proposed by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and minimum wages by at least twice as fast, this has clearly negative consequences for companies' competitiveness and employment.
Such negative effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example in Latgale.
The fact that we cannot afford a significant increase in the minimum wage at the moment means that other mechanisms should be put in place to support low wage earners.
An immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with personal income tax to an exempt minimum (within budget limits).
Insufficient education, inadequate education and poor quality of education acquired, as well as inadequate health status (often due to the cost of medical services and long lines) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 Latvian company’s responses to the increase in the minimum wage in January 2014 were received.
The survey was carried out within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN).
These figures represent companies with a workforce of at least 10.
This also explains the low workers’ share of minimum wages in construction.
Last day there were 11 fires registered in Latvia, as demonstrated by the operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
The biggest fires in Latvia were located in Ogres municipality, Ogresgala parish, where an unmanaged residential house burned in an area of 80 square meters, and in the city of Jēkabpils, the Dzelzcelmalas street, where an open flame was burned with chips filled in an area of 30 square meters.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls for waste, tyres, two cars, a building’s wall and ceiling, a barn, a house’s roof, and an unattended lit food.
The service has also participated in 21 rescue work during the day.
No fatal, injured, or rescued people are reported.
In total, during the last 24 hours, the DGT responded to 38 calls, of which six were misleading.
This weekend, from 12 to 14 August, Riga will celebrate the 815th anniversary of the city with a wide range of cultural, artistic and sporting events.
This year's festival is taking place in film art, so most of the programme is created in this theme.
The most ambitious part of the celebration will take place on November 11, in Old Town, but various events are also expected in the city centre and neighbourhoods.
At the Christmas Climax, on the evening of August 13, after the big concert "Kino Spirit", the singers will be delighted by fireworks above the Daugava, on November 11th.
Sailing virtuosos in Daugava, basketball passion during the day at the Latvian National Opera, opening the commemorative sign for the first film session, craftsman markets, a wide holiday restaurant under the open sky in Spīķeri, various concerts, open-air cinema shows and an opportunity to become a hero of a new film - these events and many other events will delight both Rigans and city guests for three days.
Looking forward to the Riga Festival, we offer a selection of events, which will make it possible to enjoy the cinematic mood of the capital, not only in large and ambitious events, but also in fine nuances, and some of them will bring to the outskirts of the city, allowing you to get to know the 815 anniversary from another perspective.
A detailed holiday programme can be found on the official website of Riga Festival: www.rigassvetki.lv.
Russia's Vice Prime Minister meets ZZS ministers secretly in Riga.
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, Arkadijs Dvorkovics, met three ZZS politicians last week at the fish processing plant "Kija" – Finance Minister Dana Reizniecie-Ozols, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Janis Dūklavs.

The Minister explained that the organiser was the Ambassador of Russia Aleksandrs Vešņakovs.
The Minister of Finance has found that the negotiations have been about the possibility of lifting sanctions on fish processors, as well as whether Russia will continue to "pump" gas in Incukalns gas storage.
Dvorkovics has explained that this is not a government issue, but an energy company issue.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the conversation.
Dūklāvs has justified this, that he has not seen such a need, because "this Foreign Minister is on vacation", writes the portal.

The legendary editor, Huffington, leaves The Huffington Post.
Arianna Haffington, co-founder and main editor of the powerful U.S. media holding "The Huffington Post", has announced leaving the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicer Prize, offering both serious political and economic journalism, and ensuring that Internet sensations are reflected in entertainment news, is considered as a source of media development at a time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
Media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time in circumstances where there was not yet a Twitter, but Facebook gained popularity only among students at national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of George Bush, a representative of the Republican Party, of the U.S. President, Hafington did not hide the fact that media journalists represent liberal values and that world view will also produce news material.
Now Hafington on Twitter discovers that after leaving, she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a "Thrive Global" startup to address workers' health and congestion issues.
It is not yet known who could take her place under the Huffington Post.
During her activity, the portal gave up the anonymous comments, stressing to Hafington that freedom of expression is granted to people who stand up for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
Also, under her leadership, it was decided in summer 2015 to publish information about the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in the entertainment news section.
However, at the end of 2015, indicating that Trump's rhetoric is dangerous to US society, details of the odiosis candidate were published again in the policy section.
It was reported that in 2011 the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news website "The Huffington Post", which was visited by almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amount amounted to USD 315 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant Verizon bought AOL for 4.4 billion US dollars.
Verizon also bought Yahoo internet business parts in 2016.
With these transactions, "The Huffington Post", a powerful and independent medium, became a small particle from a giant corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand's media is available in nine international versions, with the total unique number of visits per month being estimated at 81 million.
Four people have been killed in explosives in Thailand.
Nine explosions, killing at least four people and several dozen injured, have taken place in the Thai resort town of Huahin and in the southern provinces of the country in the last 24 hours, announced by the authorities on Friday.
Two explosions took place in the province of Surathon in southern Thailand on Friday at about eight o’clock after local time.
One explosive exploded in front of a marine police building, killing a municipal worker and wounding a man, announced in Surathon the Provincial Governor of Vongsiri Promčana.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the province police station.
In the south Friday morning of Thailand, two explosions took place on the popular Phuket Island.
On Friday morning, two bombs were exploding in Huahin at the bell tower, killing one and wounding three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday night, just before midnight, two explosions were hit in the resort town of Huahin, killing one woman and wounding 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman killed on Thursday in Huahin was a Thai woman.
Of the 19 injured three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huahin were hidden in two flower pots 50 feet [50 m] apart.
The explosives were detonated with mobile phones with half an hour difference.
Before that, on Thursday, one person died in an explosion that took place in the province of Tran in southern Thailand.
The police rescue the infant from overheating in the car; the parents are threatened by judicial acts over the glass.
In Riga, yesterday municipal policemen rescued the infant from a hot car, while the child’s parents threatened the police with court works about the broken glass of the car, the agency LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, a man was worried about the patrol, who told me that he noticed a car in the Spice shopping centre in the parking lot, with a baby for half an hour without adults.
On arrival at the site, a car designated by the eyewitnesses, which was parked in the sun, was found.
In the front passenger seat there was a infant seat.
The baby was brightened directly by the sun.
The infant shouted loudly, breathed intensively, and his groan was reddish and flushed.
Given that the vehicle owner was not on site, it was immediately decided to eject the rear glass of the vehicle so as not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the whole seat is highlighted from a hot vehicle, and a medical officer has been called.
The child breathes shallow, the skin was red and hot, so until medical doctors arrived, the guards put a cool compress on the forehead.
Medical and child’s parents almost simultaneously arrived at the site of the event.
When the baby’s father saw the broken window on his vehicle, he remained aggressive and did not let his medical staff present him.
Discussions with parents have been carried out and it has been explained that children under the age of seven are not allowed to leave one unattended child.
In addition, the child was left in health and life - threatening conditions.
After the discussion, the victim was examined and found not to be in need of hospitalisation.
The parents, on the other hand, strongly refused to give any explanations about what had happened and threatened with judicial work on the broken glass of the car.
During their discussions with their parents, there was no indication that they were under the influence of alcohol or in any other way harming the child, so the baby was placed under the care of both of them for less than four months.
The case materials were sent to the Children's Crime Prevention Department, whose employees will evaluate parental responsibility.
The RPP reminds us that even if there is not a very hot outside, a car left in the sun is heated very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, this can endanger their lives.
The members of the LPF could request the suspension of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could in the near future request that its current head, Kaspars Poni, be removed from the office of the President of the Federation, LETA was told by Jānis Dzenis, former vice-president of the Federation.
He said that, in view of the criticism of Poni in recent days and his activities in the Federation, several members of the LPF had signed a letter calling for the LPF General Assembly, which is the highest institution in the Federation, and it is entitled to decide any question raised by the LPF General Assembly.
The members of the Federation are dissatisfied with the leadership style of Mr.
He pointed out that the members of the LPF, as well as the secretary-general of the Federation, Aivars Platonov, have done a great deal of work for the development of the Federation and sport, but the contribution of Mr President to the Federation is not very welcome.
A man who had worked for a long time in the Federation explained that there was a visible attempt in the Federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
The members of the Federation could therefore also request an amendment to the rules governing the functioning of the LPF, which would rule out such a possibility in the future.
He explained that the dissatisfiedness with the work of Mr. in the Federation has long existed, but the events of the last days have served as members of the Federation of "last castles" to decide that action should be taken.
The former vice-president of the Federation said that during the life of Mr.
He explained that in order to ensure a faster process and decision-making in the Federation, members of the LPF had decided at a general meeting to authorise the Governing Board, composed of Sir and two vice-presidents, to manage the Federation.
However, as Zenny admitted, Mr. Knight deceived the members of the Federation.
The members of the Federation trusted the Lord, believing that this would enable the Federation to make decisions more quickly.
"He deceived the confidence of his members, because practically took power in his hands by making an unethical step," Densis pointed out.
"This attitude cannot come from a person who should serve as an example for other sports representatives," said Dzenis.
In his view, Mr. President has tried to meet his ambitions, which in turn does not honor him as President of the LPF.
The long-term secretary-general of the LPF, Vladimir Maslovskis, told the agency LETA that a letter could be submitted to the federation next week, so that the LPF General Assembly should meet within one month.
In his view, the general meeting has "to speak about all the issues that have been hurt" and to decide on the way forward.
Mr President, it was not yet known on Friday that the members of the LPF were planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his removal.
So far I don't know anything about having such a meeting, so I don't have any comments.
As regards the fact that my friends are dissatisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the coach Jakubovskis, mentioned earlier, when some dissatisfiedness has been expressed.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakava was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this occasion Jakubovskis lost the position of senior coach of the team, because his actions did not match LPF's interests," said Mr.
He also pointed out that the LPF members’ general meetings who had accounted for the progress had so far not received accusations.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the work of the Federation has improved," the President of the LPF said.
Mr. John also explained that the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro had not gone to have fun, but had to work.
For more people in Latvia, it is unclear and they do not understand what functions the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Olympic Committee of Latvia (LOK), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sports federation has sufficient funding, because only 10% of the national LPFs receive the necessary amount.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"I have also entered into negotiations and worked to see one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Mr.
According to data from "Firmas.lv" portal, in 2015 LPF revenue totalled 249 444 euros, which is about 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was the result of targeted grants received last year, which increased by around €10 000 compared to 2014.
Similarly, in the form of members, accessions and other annual contributions, LPF received approximately 43% of revenue, or 109 442 euros.
Last year the Federation received a further €35 532 in the form of donations and donations.
Last year's expenditure in the Federation increased by around €70 000, with a total cost of €263 876 in 2015.
The biggest expenditure was not related to cash payments to persons, material expenditure and salaries - EUR 215 733 was reported as "other expenditure".
Cash payments to persons have been spent EUR 20 549, while salaries have been paid EUR 14 684.
If the Federation had concluded 2014 with a positive balance, then the LPF concluded 2015 with a negative balance.
According to the report, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) has requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about the participation of Mr.
Latvian citizens have not been hit by the explosions that took place in Thailand, showing the entry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the social site Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that according to the information available to the Honorary Consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian citizens had not been hit by explosions.
LETA has already told that JOS invites travellers to keep track of information about the development of political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure about the security of their place of residence, indicating that there is a high terrorist threat in the country.
The Latvian YAM invites to avoid gathering places, to be particularly careful and attentive while staying in public places, and to follow local authorities’ instructions.
Travellers who are located in Thai resorts or are planning to go there, the Ministry invites you to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the travel will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to keep track of the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the fragile security situation in the country, they are not recommended to travel to the Thai and Cambodian border, as well as to the provinces of Thailand and Malaysia in the border area of Patan, Yala, Narathivata and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department's day duty officer immediately by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
IT IS also strongly recommended to anyone travelling abroad to purchase life and health insurance policies, including repatriation in the event of sickness or death, and to register in the consular register.
However, we will not leave Argentina's football selection.
The football superstar Lionel Messi, however, decided to return to Argentina after a short period of reflection, announced on Friday by the player himself.
In July, Argentina's team for the second year in a row failed at Copa America's finals, reaffirming Chile's supremacy in the decisive match.
Immediately after his loss, the Messi announced that he would leave the country, but then he was reported to return to the sample.
"I seriously considered leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and my selection is too great," said 29-year-old Messi.
Spain's grand Barcelona attacker Messi in a total of 112 games got 55 gates, which is the best ever indicator.
Together with the sample of adults, the Messi has not been a great success, although Argentina became the world's vice-champion as early as 2014.
We're five times called the world's best footballer.
For Chinese Gin and Iron doubles in Rio 20 km walking distance.
On Friday, Chinese campaignors Van Dyn and Cai Dzelin won a double victory in Rio de Janeiro in the 20 kilometers of Olympic Games.
The Olympic champion was crowned by Gins, who took the distance in 19 minutes and four seconds, ahead of Dzelina for 12 seconds.
And then the bronze was won by Australian sorcerer Dein Burd-Smit, who lost his 23 seconds.
Kay Bonfim, a householder’s favorite, corrected Brazil’s record, but he missed five seconds to climb to the honorary pedestal.
Four years ago, the Bronze Prize was awarded in London.
He also has two silver medals in the world championships in the same distance.
Judo Coach Baskins: Niikiforenko isn't the right weight.
Latvian jazz coach Oleg Baskins acknowledged in good faith that Arthur Nikiforenko at the Rio Olympics had almost no chance of overcoming the much heavier Azerbaijani athletes Ušangi Kukauri.
In practice, there was no chance, but minimal if he could be caught by a method or a parterre.
We had already anticipated that this would be the case.
When he was prepared, he was well - prepared, and the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well - known because Niikiforenko had fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arthur is artificially cast into the heaviest weight category to get into the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already busy, so Arthur used the European quota for the heavy weight category.
Arthur, weighing 100 kilograms, fought against a jute player of 140 kilograms and who has already won several major tournaments.
In the heavy weight category in general there is very little random moment.
If all kinds of turnarounds occur in light weight categories, then the heavy ones - very rarely.
Whether Nikiforenko would be better to fight one degree in the lightest weight category in the future, Baskins responded in a positive way.
I think yes, Arthur would be better at fighting in a category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the right weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to stop President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that there was no "time" for the withdrawal of the vote that had taken place this year, with which Čavismo will be in power until 2019 - people in the streets of Caracas continued as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Phelps got two more medals," said Rafael Deians, a 36-year-old officeman who rested on Wednesday in Altamira Square.
Date of birth: (a) Approximately 1963, (b) 1966.
However, now that the opposition needs to exert greater pressure than ever before in order to achieve a referendum this year, people are no longer showing such energy throughout the country.
"I want a referendum, but I'm not going to take part in the protests for security reasons," said Deans.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are less motivated.
Tibisejs Lusena, Chairman of the Election Board, commented that the government is delaying the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support: in the signature collection phase, people arrived in unprecedented numbers.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number on myths is significantly smaller.
"Some people are focusing on food line formation, while others are afraid after 2014 arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator representing the opposition.
After Lusen announced that until the next step in the referendum process - even more signatures will have to be collected across the country - those who are against the socialist government will have to wait until October; those who claim that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelan people by making them believe that the vote is practically impossible this year.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were to take place in 2017, Maduro could be suspended from office but would be allowed to name the next president.
If he is suspended today, he is obliged to announce general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, inviting the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for the constitutional rights of Venezuelans.
"The rest of the steps to implement the Presidential referendum must be taken in a clear, concrete and immediate manner, thus contributing to a swift and effective resolution of the country's current political, economic and social difficulties," it was written.
Louis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 that changes are not expected as soon as possible.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said in FNL.
He said that Lucen and the government were breaking the law, but they would end up reaching their goal if people did not speak out loudly.
The opposition called for a broad manifesto in September. First of all, in Caracas to ask to speed up the process so that withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilised this day in the capital.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanka, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot be expected for such a long time.
"They should respond to the Lusen Statement faster and stronger, as it practically kills the referendum," said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make it faster, while others want more time to organise the group.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity will be low in the second campaign to collect signatures," said Salamanka.
The referendum process, to be activated, needs to be supported by twenty percent of national voters, representing almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government concludes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said FNL.
The director of LNSC A. Puķeti shall be temporarily suspended from office.
At the extraordinary meeting of the Lielvarde District Council held on 12 August, the majority of the members supported the suspension of Ainars Puķis, Director of Lielvarde District Sports Centre (LNSC) from the performance of his duties for as long as the verification of service is carried out.
In the near future, it is planned to clarify the circumstances written by a visitor of the gym in his application to the municipality.
In particular, during the visit to the gym the LNSC client suffered a head injury.
Lielvārde Municipality Sports Centre is being blamed.
Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and possible recourse of the client to court, a commission was set up by Order of Vice-President of Lielvardė District Council Vita Volonte.
Its task is to carry out a service test at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August this year.
On the next Tuesday, it is planned to re-introduce an extraordinary meeting of the Council to decide on further action.
It should be noted that during a particular accident, A. Puķitis was on vacation.
The Director of the Sports Centre from Friday until the end of his trial shall be the Deputy Director of the Training at Oksana Grimaluska-Nazarova.
For the Olympic seniors, sport is a celebration.
Today the sports festival of the Ogres Pensioners Association took place at the Sports Center stadium in Ogres County.
The seniors were welcomed by Sanita Tauriņa, the organizer of the Sport Development Centre of the Ogres District Sports Centre, who had prepared a special programme for participants of the Sport Festival.
This time individual results will not be assessed, but participants of sports events will be divided into four teams.
"The investment made by each participant will be the result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball high speed, Eiffel tower construction together with a memory game, florball decency staff, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start all four disciplines of the festival program, the participants had to perform the warm-up tasks - "Unity circle", "Rīņķis dancis", "Spleen", as well as three horse horse horse horse riding, to complete the frisbium and badminton elements.
All tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festival carried out them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer skiing, which took place in the costumes prepared by the organizers, was a special joy.
The competition was closely followed by volunteers of the Sports Centre of Ogres district, who led the tasks, recorded the results and did not interfere with the advice.
There was also Ogres symbol for Čekurs, who inspired the participants of the Sport Festival.
Ogres seniors proved to be quite active, attractive and in good sports form.
Peteris Zeps, a representative of the Green team, put the ball in the basketball basket eight times within one minute, but his teammate Jānis Staujas, a member of the team, left behind only one effective shot.
The pensioners are active in Ogre.
The buses are always full of buses and about 300 people arrive at the parties.
"Two times a week we meet at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novous, table tennis, use exercise equipment," says Jānis Staujas, Chairman of Ogres Pensioners Association.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation from the Sports Centre of the Ogres District, but the biggest benefit is the movement in the fresh air, good mood and time spent together.
No.19 West Bromwich Albion 2016/2017
Guardian journalists forecast position 14 (Note: it is not only Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalists' council as a whole)
Last season, item 14
Probability to win the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked like a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again be a fight for satisfaction or stiffness, depending on how "the glass is empty" is even more pragmatic under the leadership of Tony Pulis.
But then Jeremy Piss sold 88% of his club's shares to Guochuan To and Pulis, in archety safe hands, made immediately a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first made manager.
The situation has undoubtedly changed Balack Country - and not only the Hawthornes, but also a few miles to the northwest of Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners, without having to waste their time, gave up the services of Kenya Jacquet.
However, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, the businessman has also expressed his desire not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the club's habits or start an unsustainable fun," he said, taking over the duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we remain in the Prime Minister and then go further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I believe it is the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulis; the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realise that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the huge work recently invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
In order to go beyond the 14th place of the last season, more work will certainly have to be done.
Only Aston Villa, at the bottom of the table, hit less than the gate, and it is worth recalling that during Christmas, Albion had on average less than one blow at the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst of the Division.
They couldn't get the gate to 13 out of 38 games, and beat more than one gate to only nine games.
From their 10 victories none of the games managed to get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a dozen of 34 gates in total came from standard positions.
It is no wonder that Hawthorne was dissatisfied in the team, probably the most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 is not distinguished by Villa at the end of January, when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams had better security records - although no club has managed to list four centre security guards.
These guards are often underestimated, especially Johnny Evans, who wants to get to Arsenal in view of the recent crisis in the hands of the players.
Northern Ireland's international team experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of money on selling.
Ben Foster's reliable and well-completed in the middle line.
Daren Flecher, much like Evans, has shown to a large extent that he is still capable of playing at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs is undervalued.
It is disturbing to all sides that the long and glittering story of the future of Sayo Berahino is still unclear.
When Piss was in the owner's rank, the bets from Stock and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain at peace and Mark Hujez is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth taking action by all the parties involved.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has already mentioned, many times, if he is drawn here to the other side, it has been evident for a long time that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents on the change before allowing a former member of the U-21 team in England to go, but their 15 million-pound move with Diafra Saho broke out a few days before the takeover, claiming that he passed a medical examination and agreed on everything, but had a back injury, which would mean that he would have to miss the beginning of the season.
This puts great pressure on the Venetian, Salomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful for a while last season, but he has to improve his nine gate performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Aničebi and Stefan Césegnon also looks amazing.
The Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous with his slow new players moving up and three female - Jonathan Leco, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts' appearance in the last season with an outstanding 1-1 with Liverpool, will hardly become the norm.
He will return to those who have been tried and tested, but it is worth keeping Leko in sight.
The 17-year-old attacker took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in the Premiere, which is also highly appreciated in the English youth football system.
Matt Phillips, with the 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who took part in the first competition on the weekend.
It wouldn't be dared if the end were rather urgent.
"All," Puliss said last month in Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen rear players, middle players and front players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
Getting them turns out to be much more difficult than expected, mainly because of uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven highly winning games before the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
In the meantime, pressures on Pulis will become less or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue operation after the authorised pension relief change
The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without the involvement of the pension protection fund (PPF) by increasing the company’s prospects for a rescue operation.
The British steel pension scheme commits GBP 15 billion and estimates a deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating a serious obstacle to a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the future of Britain's business, which employs 11 000 people, after negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on the restructuring of the British steel pension scheme and the government's financial support.
Alan Johnson, the authorised president of pensions, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were to be modified.
Although this is well funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit of GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnson said that the trustees admit that it "is not real" to the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than joining the FPF, and he added that workers should accept less favourable conditions.
The sources of Tata Steel warns that they could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steel industry since the negotiations on the business future of its Britain started in March, and it has been used as a shortcut in the negotiations with the British Government.
Kušik Chaterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "sustainable".
Speaking at the culinary Tata Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on restructuring pension schemes were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc.," said Catherine, reports Times of India.
It is believed that pensions have some impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The willingness of the pension authorities to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include shifting the way annual inflation-based benefit growth is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnson added: "The fully-fledged and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the ability of the scheme to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period of time and with a low risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent decline in the securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes.
CBS commentator mixes Michael Phelps and Rien Lochti all the length of the game
The commentator of the Canadian broadcaster's CBC Olympic Games on Thursday evening has provoked anger by mixing Michael Pelps with his competitor Ryan Lochti.
Elliots Fridman both loved the entire 200-metre individual swim in which Phelps won, winning his 22. Olympic gold medal.
When Phelps crossed the line, Fridman held him up as Lochti, Phelps, and an ancient competitor at the top of the world’s swimmers.
Fredman said, "He's gonna end up doing it!"
Ryan Lochte will beat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps might not even go to the honorary pedestal.
But the Phelps won, but the Lohte finished the fourth.
Immediately after Phelps was at the gold, the CBS broadcast quietly.
In a miraculous way, he immediately admitted his error.
I'm sorry, I mixed the tracks.
Phelps with gold," he said.
A Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was widely appreciated after a mistake, again admitted his error within the next hours after the event and apologized viewers on the Twitter.
I'm sorry.
I was surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Phelps exceeded 2 168-year-old record as the winner of the biggest Olympic victory ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonid of Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympic Games than anyone else.
The Russian hackers have attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
The hackers have made public the lists of General Philip Bridlov and data on the work of one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers, who may have been able to attack the U.S. Democratic Party e-mails and publish their lists some time ago, could also be responsible for the new series of attacks, reports agent Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber-attacks attacked the correspondence of the former NATO European Force Commander Philippe Bridlov and the "Open Society" Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers published information on the DCLeaks.com link.
There were written by Bridlov and data on the activities of the "Open Society" Institute.
Hackers have been reported to have access to fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers who attacked the U.S. Democratic Party computers and are led by the Russian authorities.
The U.S. intelligence service already a year ago warned Congress's high officials about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
News agency Reuters says that it has information that specs told a number of politicians that cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or their controlled organizations.
However, congressmen have not been able to pass on this information to the victims of cyber attacks because it has been secret.
The scandal about attacks on the Party’s computers started after about 20,000 e-mails were published on the Internet, written by the party representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party candidate Hillary Clinton announced that the flight was organised by Russian secretaries.
The Russian President's press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorists.

Parking in the most happy place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
Disneyland has presented information on its long-planned parking structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern side of the park.
The project, located east of the theme park 5 Freeway, includes a parking structure of 6,800 seats and a transport hub where buses, coaches, taxis and other vehicles can miss the park's visitors.
The pedestrian bridge connects the rest park over the port's buoys with the structure of the parking lot and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned expansion project of the 14 acres of the Star War Land, is part of a USD 1 billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for 30 years of exemption from the object tax.
The construction of the project, which syncs with the East Gate, will start next year.
The parking structure will be established above the Publa parking area of the Disney hero, which has about 1,300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property acquired by the theme park in 2014.
The project is expected to be launched in 2018.
"The East Gate is part of our important investments in the town of Anaheim, which will provide additional parking places for visitors and help to reduce congestion near the recreation park, while we continue to extend the Disneyland recreation park," said Disney representative Suzi Brauna.

In Liepaja, two thirds of its population will have to agree to insulation of the house.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and they are specifically talking about the technical condition of the building, if it is possible to get support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy to not use it.
One of the most important changes is that any apartment building can be co-financed by the EU from this year on condition that the facade of the building needs to be warmed up.
In the past, it was allowed to use only serial apartment houses.
The biggest concern for house managers is the organization of meetings of the owners of apartments.
A major problem, where at the moment this process is delayed by the need for 67% of apartment owners' consent.
"The previous programme required 51%," says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager of SIA "Liepājas namu valdu operator" (LNA).
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because most general meetings do not have such a number of apartment owners," says Gints Ločmelis, project manager of the company "Nami paslauriss APSE".
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "A house service APSE" and LNA, which serve about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not rule out the possibility that, at the beginning of the work, it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works, but with each project they have implemented they should improve their attitude.
I also had to get bank credit, I needed 76% of the home population.
"Speaking, explaining what will be - however, I got the signatures," indicates the most energy-efficient buildings in Latvia, the oldest Vita Iesalniece.
She agrees with Jānis, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, you can't have half figured out, and the other half plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it's important that everyone agrees with the whole event," John says.
Such a change in rules was proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experience in the last planning period.
Most commercial banks needed two thirds of the owners of the apartments.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the Department of European Union Funds of the Ministry of Economics, mentions an opportunity to present to citizens the existing examples and various benefits of renovation, such as energy saving.
When Aaron was young, he was long angry with the world about the death of his mother.
The potential suicide bomber arrest operation in Canada was worthy of press release.
Everything started when the Canadian police received a video intercepted by the US Federal Investigation Office.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video of the so-called "mock-up" recorded by an unknown person who was clearly at the stage of the final attack.
"And he was going to work it with a self-made bomb," said Deputy Chief of Canadian Police Mike Kaban.
In the video in black mask, an English - and - Arabic man threatened the Canadians and promised to avenge all they had done to the Muslims.
In about three hours, using facial and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have managed to recognize this man.
It was a 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for praising terrorist and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
By judgment, Driver was prohibited from doing so and also from engaging in any radical organization.
However, until then, the authorities did not consider that Driver would pose any physical danger to the surrounding people.
When the police arrived in the town of Stratroa in the province of Ontario, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At the time, order guards tried to arrest him, but when he was sitting on the rear seat, Driver had started the bomb.
To prevent the detonation of another explosive, the police shot a young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's got.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
At an interview with Canadian television, Wayne Driver, a father of a neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islam as a teenager.
It initially helped him cope with drugs and alcohol.
Yet, Aaron was a problematic teenager who was long angry at the world about his mother’s death, but his father added.
Only when I saw that video today, I realized how far he had gone.
I had no idea that he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he could speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been quite different.
Radēvičs will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes.
The ex-Olympic and Lt-Street Ineta Radēvičs at the LTV Olympic study said that the performance of the seven-fighter Laura Ikuniece-Admidiņa on Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athletes had a trauma.
In the high jump, Laura made a reflection with the right leg, not as usual with the left.
Radēvičs pointed out that it is comparable - just as a person who is used to writing with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikuniece-Admidiņš in terms of injury is not bad.
Radēvičs discovered that she had not yet contacted Ikunieti-Admidiņš, but that she actively followed her start and felt sympathetic.
Ineta learned about Laura's trauma recently and expressed her support for the athletes, indicating that the athletes did not start to make their cushions, but showed character and spirit of the fighter.
When talking about other sports, Radēvičs believes that the Olympic rules are very high, so to accuse one of the Latvian athletes that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She remembered that herself, while driving to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, was called a tourist, and that creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," Radēvičs discovered his experience in sport.
She told me that it was always important that there was a person in the tribunals who would give the energy of compassion.
Radēvičs himself will be a tourist this year - she will already go to Rio de Janeiro next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that she will definitely go to the athletics competitions.
Ineta Radēviča won the European Championship in 2010.
During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she took the 13th place in a long-haul and 20th position in a three-solar attack, but in the Olympic Games in 2008, the athletes did not start because they were waiting for their son.
In London, as has already been mentioned, Radeviča had 4th place in a long distance trip.
The film "Quantum Code" with physicist Kashcheev's main role will be shown in the Murrays.
The film states that alongside the division of electrons in the lab Kashčejev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic minded man and father looking for a connection with Visvaren.
The character of the film itself in the Latvian Television Programme "Morning Panorama" pointed out that taking the film was an interesting experience for him.
I learned about how film was made, how it was filmed, how it was recorded.
"And actually fantastic work," said the physicist.
He admitted that he had produced the film in two years.
The biggest disagreements with the directors have been about the title of the film.
I am critical of this name.
No quantum code.
"There is no secret that you could find out when you see the film and it's all clear," said the associate professor of LU.
Kashcheyev admitted that he likes that the film will experience the premiere precisely during the Muryan Open-Air cinema evening.
They are organised by friends from the Foundation Easy, and these cinemas will take place every night until 9 September.
Four people died in bomb explosions in tourist attractions in Thailand
After the people of Thailand voted in favour of the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, on Thursday and Friday in five southern provinces of Thailand - the popular tourist destinations - there was a series of bombs that killed four and injured many people.
The first two explosions dragged into the seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, the next Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that one Thai woman died in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of them being foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions were dragged in the southern cities of Phuket, Tran and Suratthan.
Two bombs exploded in the Phuket suburb of Patonga and two more in the Phanna province - in the tourism region north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been killed in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen, the Thai Royal Police Officer, declared that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered to be local sabotage acts.
"It is too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are, in fact, local sabotage, and we are trying to find those responsible."
On 12 August 2016, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene following a small power bomb explosion in Huahin.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb explosions in Thailand’s important tourist areas.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and no special group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosion took place in the same week that the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - have rejected the referendum supported by the military, and in the south-eastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population is Muslims, since 2004 more than 6500 people have died in unrest.
The bombs took place on the birthday of Queen Siricita of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
Huahin is located in the royal palace Klai Kangwon or "a castle far from anxiety", where the Thai royal family often lives.
King Bumbolo Aduljadius was the longest reigning monarch in the world.

Porgis and Bess - something we've deserved a long time ago!
There are countless operas that have never sounded in Latvia.
There are very rare sounds.
It seems strange, however, if since the 1970s George Görschvin's opus Porgius and Bess have not been staged or played, unless they include a chrestomatic solo number such as Summertime's periodic humiliation on the stage (including the title sound at the Inese Galante Summer Festival), individual student projects, guest shows, and so on.
It has its own reasons – since Latvia has been a country of the civilized Western world, it is bound by the rules of Gēršvins family heirs and copyright licences, which are in force until 2030 for Porgy and Bess.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wished that all fourteen soloists should be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts of the USA around this opera are little known and the composer's desire to do so would be difficult.
The concert by the compromise was performed with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters on 6 August at the Cesis Art Festival on 10th anniversary, recalling Gēršvin's charming musical record, featuring the classical music traditions of Europe with American jazz rhythms, gossips, fashion dances at the beginning of the 20th century and still hits, depicting the avalanche of Cetphishrow's crippling Porgy and the love story of the lightweight Taurene Bess in a musical quality that would deserve documentation for the annals of the history of music.
Firstly, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Poga.
Despite the complex spatial layout of the concert in open-air conditions in the park of Cesis castle, the orchestra was on the next stage next to the stage, on which soloists were working and the choir was singing (and great dance!) While, the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, contrast-rich and accurate in both stinging, metal blow instruments and piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the great soloist team.
Haristmatic dramatic baritone Lester Linch (Porgy) is a European and American-loved singer whose repertoire includes both baritone and bassbaritone parties, especially Verdi operas.
Porgy has healed many times, several times Kraun - he felt like a fish in this opera and also inspired stage partners to create an emotional atmosphere of solidarity among poor people in the fishing village.
Letony Moore's second concert in Porgy and Bess (the first was held in 2012, no less than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retle) revealed itself as a vitally plastic combination of different vocal styles with a dramatically toned theme and fantastic piano in the upper register.
Not for nothing, she is one of today’s brightest Aida.
The attractive Thai-origin tenor, Germein Smith, who Andris Poga once watched in Boston, has a role as a firm in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his synchronous dancing and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare cleanups whose voice seems to be still hidden in the open vocal possibilities as 15 years ago when the opera's voice was accidentally found, hanging it to smile at peers.
Unbelievablely, even in the 24th row and relative darkness, the expressive sign language of Jermein Smith makes it possible to see in his hands the dust bag of happiness, even if it's not there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistopholis tempter, who in vain puts faith in the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The cargo’s role was reproduced by the tembrally generous Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team at Cesis was Sirina, represented by Sonora Vaice, the luxury top register, the skillful balancing between spoken and sang text, correspondingly changing the voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatic performance both in Sirina's pity My Man is Gone Now, and in the stylized pre-heard's amplification by Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilsone sounded well in the role of Clara, but the iconic Summertime sounded for a little bit of a loud and nervous, while gaining its true character in the rapture.
Colorite and beautifully expressed the parties entrusted to Mihail Čulpayev, Rihards Mačanovskis, Andris Lapiņš (especially the Krabju seller on the castle ruins in response to Irma Pastare's delicious strawberry seller in the soprano testure).
Stupendous characters in the images of Ilona Bagel, Rihard Miller, Emil Kivlenieks, as well as in the roles spoken, where Ivo Martinson’s explorer and the director and actor Juris Žagars, who was unexpectedly presented to the audience in the image of the white lawyer Arčdale.
In the spatial concept of the concert, created by Viesturs Kairichs, the choir operated on the steps, the soloists - mainly in the proscēni, rarely coming up or going on the stairs.
In satisfactory dynamic performance, a little comical situation was made in the hands of the Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has quite a prosaic explanation.
First of all, some soloists sang several episode roles (which sometimes made it difficult to track their stage identity).
Secondly, in Porgy and Bess there are many dialogues, texting phrases, replicas, which are easier to track with handkerchiefs.
The Titration Machine helped the audience to study the details of the operation.
The weather did not bother the first part of the concert long enough.
However, it did not prevent most of the listeners from staying until the end to swindle artists.
Nine in the evening, however, is a rather late start for a full-length opera, especially if a longer home trip from Cesis is expected, however, opera Porgius and Bess have returned to the Latvian music scene and will probably become one of this summer's brightest musical adventures.
In Liepaja too, where it sounded last night, and under very other acoustic conditions.
In Riga at the playground, a man feared children with axe.
Yesterday, August 11, around 8 a.m., the State Police received a message from a single grandmother of a terrified child who was worried about the fact that there was a man on Lomonosova street in a children's square who feared children with axe.
The law enforcement officers responded immediately to the call and arrived at the place where they met this man with an ax, who at the time of the event was under very high alcohol pressure - 3.07 promenades.
It was found that the man who was born in 1962 had feared the children in advance so that they did not noise.
This time, however, an aggressive man used an axe to hit the children’s playground equipment to frighten his children.
The man was arrested.
In connection with the events, criminal proceedings have been initiated for gross interference with public order, which is manifested by obvious disrespect for society or shamelessness, ignoring the common standards of conduct and disrupting people's peace.
Such crime shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of not more than two years, or by temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by a fine and subject to probationary supervision for a period of not more than three years.
Federation presidents in the Olympic Games usually use guest accreditation.
The presidents of sports federations usually arrive on the Olympic venue for a few days and use the accreditation of guests for whom names may be changed, therefore they have several owners during the competition, the agency was told by Marita Vilciņa, representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, a great deal of dawn arose from statements by Germans Jakubovsky, the Olympic swimmer, who discovered that he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro by the head of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Sir, while the trainer should stay at home.
Later, it became known that Mr. Brazil had arrived with the coach's accreditation, for which the president himself was surprised, because "there is no way in there right now".
According to Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations lived in the London Olympics - Sir, as well as Guntis Zalutis, the head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS).
In the Olympic village there are athletes as well as official persons, including e.g. coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
So, probably also in London, Sir had the coach's accreditation.
"The other presidents of the federations come as guests, and they have accreditations that can be changed - they arrive for a few days and then someone else uses it", said Vilciņa, explaining that therefore the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro came to Rio already at the end of July and Brazil will leave on August 13, so he is likely to be there the longest of the presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, Latvian athletes started swimming only one day - August 10th.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports in Rio de Janeiro, and the agency's LETA calculations show that the presidents of six or seven federations will take part in the four-year most important competitions.
President of Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be on Saturday's visit to Brazil next week's BMX competition, President of Latvian Windsurfing Federation Ansis Dāle plans to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16, when the start of Katie Birzule will be over, but the President of the Latvian Fight Federation Dzintars Urbančiks will be on August 16.
The President of the Latvian Shooting Federation, Kārlis Krēsliņš, has also planned to arrive next week, when the start of the shooter Dainis Upelnieks will also be finished.
The President of the Latvian Judo Federation Raimonds Rublovskis did not at least during the Latvian athletes' competition in Rio de Janeiro, even though his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation currently has no president, but the Latvian weighing society is still in conflict and its athletes are presented by the Latvian Olympic Committee for international competitions.
Meanwhile, the President of the Volleyball Federation of Latvia Atis Jaunnitis and the Head of the Tennis Union of Latvia Juris Savickis decided not to come to Rio de Janeiro.
Vasiļjevs appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiliev is very often visiting Latvia during the last few years.
More recently, he evaluated the contestants at the "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016" finals and acknowledged that Latvian beauty is proud of natural breasts and lips, which are not improved with silicone and botulin injections.
In a conversation with "Wakara Zins", Alexander Vassiliev told that for years he has been the president of the jury at the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That's why he has been very interested in the evaluation of "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016".
Asking about the differences between Latvian beauty competition standards and similar competitions in Russia, Vassiliev stressed that Latvians and waterfalls have very different figures: "Russian beauty competition participants have more breasts than Latvian contestants."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and encrypted, as well as they can be proud of their natural beauty, not the miracles performed by plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition with their natural beauty.
Due to his professional activities in Latvia Vasiļjev has large plans.
Currently, the exhibition "Praised Nature" of the fashion historian's collection is open at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, Livonian Order Castle, there is an exhibition of Vassiliev's "Casses Dresses 1860-2010".
Vassiliev loved Ventspils so much that for a couple of days he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city and went on a walk along the sea.
I love it very much in Latvia.
Especially now, when there is a terrorist threat across Europe, there is a real corner of Paradise here.
"It is a pure pleasure to spend time and relax in Latvia", said fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23, Alexander Vassiliev will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Please help!
Please donate for our son, brother, grandson.
As Rinald’s family, we are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God for the opportunity to save Rinald, but unfortunately, at present there is no possibility to fully bear the cost of medicine by themselves.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11-year-old tumor who was diagnosed with brain tumor at the end of July.
This year he finished grade 4 at the Milzkalne Primary School with greatness, a powerful athletes and a very talented artist.
It seems that everything went to him.
Healthy, happy, persistent, hardy and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will remain in our family’s memory for life.
The last few weeks were suffering from nausea, headache, and doctors were late for the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed like that.
Because who could have imagined that such "innocent" symptoms at fault were something much more serious that was inconceivable to mind.
On July 26, we got a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumor.
The fluid in the brain is rapidly stored, but all doctors in Latvia can help is to perform a bypass surgery to remove the excess fluid, because the tumor is practically unavailable for direct surgery.
Nor can it be determined whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
Further national paid plan: start radiation and watch what is happening.
Looks like a nightmare like this: we're going to experiment here, we're going to look at the results.
Happily, Rinalda’s research results were presented to the doctor in Spain.
He is Vice-President of the World Neuro-surgical Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgists.
He engaged in an operation operation, and it turned out to be urgent.
The tumor exerts enormous pressure on the brain and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, as early as 8 August, Rinald and Mom Evia were in Spain and operated on 9 August.
A very complex operation lasting more than 6 hours was performed.
The operation took place at "Santa Elena" clinic.
We managed to remove most of the tumor, reduce pressure, obtain analysis samples.
Rinald is already standing up from his bed and, like a good teenager, he demands his fries at dinner.
Now we have to wait for the results of oncological analyses.
Thanks to Dr. Araez and the clinic's management, who understood the situation and operated urgently, without receiving full payment for treatment before surgery.
They believed that the remaining amount would be paid, calling for a first contribution of only EUR 10 000 in order to operate and save Rinald's life.
The parents managed to raise EUR 6 000 by selling equipment, while the rest of the necessary travel expenses, accommodation, and the first hospital contribution were able to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 more is needed to pay for the first stage of treatment in Spain and pay back the money that we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us return this, Rinald's health so important, surgery.
Every euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation that has already been carried out and to be able to successfully continue Rinalda's treatment.
The signs of anxiety in Ukraine ask: What do Vladimir Putin think?
It has been concluded that these claims are true.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but little to be able to hinder Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or misinterpretation for political purposes, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Former so-called ‘Prime Minister’ of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
The attempted attack in Crimea is still a matter of concern, although there are quite few grounds for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor such a scenario.
Whatever happened, the images found by open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the attack was expected.
It shows how heavy arms convoys, including shore-based missile systems, are moving across the peninsula.
Obstructively known escalation of Russian escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had already been planning rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a great coincidence that it just happened in one of the most stressful times since annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known at the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, no matter how realistic it may be, for some greater purpose.
Analysts point to worrying parallels with Russia's behaviour just before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military manoeuvres, a cover was provided to the volunteers of the resistance forces in Crimea to take on a peninsula that was still under Ukrainian control at the time, only to discover that they were in fact special Russian entities that started the military occupation.
In August, when the separatists supported by Russia failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed his forces along the border, warning that they might be needed to "defence" Russian ethnic civilians who are being attacked in Ukraine.
He organised a convoy of assistance to a region that, according to NATO information, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr. Putin plan to do in Crimea?
Some made comments as to whether only Moscow was planning another military intervention.
The fights in eastern Ukraine have got worse, as was the case before the invasion in August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point of fear of military action, not of actual action, which will make Putin brief in relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mr Mark Galeoti, professor of the University of Nujork, who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of little importance as a point of starting military action against Eastern Ukraine bordering the Russian land, not Crimea, and that the rest of the country was better protected.
"There is a very small chance if the Russians really plan some large-scale offshore," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can see a classic Russian strategy to create a pressure press."
The international peace talks about Ukraine, which once was a mechanism with which Putin has imposed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him as a result of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly seen by people as failing and irrelevant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict could get out again, Putin gives the negotiations a new meaning: to get him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to start from the position of power," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled for the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could make everything much more, much worse."
Achieve an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the tensions in Crimea, it was not important to continue the negotiations, making other parties persuade him to return to the negotiating table and to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to emerge as a world power, although its economic volumes are smaller than those of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having a veto right with regard to the sovereignty of Ukraine, keeping the country under Russian control to some extent.
This may also be in favour of Putin's long-spoken hope of a large-scale agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on Ukraine and Syria, under favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin has made reference to this objective since the deterioration of the country's economic situation in 2014, several times, mainly due to the decline in the country's export value of oil and gas.
Since his invasion in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition for the fight against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider it necessary to ensure such an agreement before the end of the term of office of President Obama in January.
Russian officials generally believe that the next President will be Hillary Clinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, although he is obviously friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be "seeking solutions, not conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the window to make sure that things are done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a large-scale agreement fails, Putin seems to be satisfied with the maintenance of Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what it will be.
In the previous version of this article, it was wrong to point out the year of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
This took place in 2014 and not in 2013.
When the Congress is at a dead end, the White House directs the means to fight the Zika virus
On Thursday, the Obama administration said that it would shift USD 81 million away from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the development of vaccines against the Zika virus by taking emergency measures, as Congress did not approve new funding to combat the virus.
Silvija Metjus Barvela, Secretary for Health and Humanitarian Services, indicated to the participants of the Congress that without the assigned funds, the National Health Institute and the Biomedical Institute for in-depth research and development will remain free of money in the fight against skin transmitted disease until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be necessary to stop the vaccine at an important moment, as the number of cases of country-acquired Zika’s disease increases in May.
Last week, 7 350 cases of the Zika virus were reported in the United States, mostly in Puertorico (reported by Disease Control and Prevention Centres).
Mrs Barwell said that 15 infants were born to birth birth defects related to the Zika virus.
The virus can cause brain developmental abnormalities and other serious birth defects in infected mothers.
The spread of the disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has raised the political rates for the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton stopped the Tuesday campaign in Winwood, Miami, where there was an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus and put pressure on Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have had contradictory thoughts for most of the year on Zika virus issues.
In February, Obama called for USD 1.9 billion in emergency funding.
The Republics suspended it by requesting a more detailed account of what the money would be used for.
For months now, the legislators have been arguing about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democrats blocked the examination of the measure proposed by the Republicans, which would allocate $1,1 billion to the fight against the Zika virus, but would include provisions prohibiting the allocation of funds for family planning for the provision of contraception in connection with a virus that could be transmitted to sexual activity.
Because of this deadlock, the White House in April was forced to channel USD 589 million, which was designed to fight the Ebola virus, the fight against the Zika virus. Around two thirds of the funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barwell said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be fully spent by the end of August.
"The inability to decide on emergency funding for the fight against the Zika virus has led the administration to choose between postponing important vaccine development work and taking part in other valuable national programmes in order to avoid this delay temporarily," Barvela wrote.
Democracy has taken on board this statement to condemn the Republicans from giving additional money to combat the Zika virus.
At the news conference representative Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited representative Paul D.Raien, the speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress about the transfer of this event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and now we are addressing the National Institute of Health," said Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr Ryan's advisors say that the transfer of funds is a long-standing step that has been delayed by Obama's administration to bring maximum political benefits from the problem of the Zika virus.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced that it had launched clinical trials against the Zika virus in 80 people, and looks forward to launching the second phase of the "Zika virus epidemic in countries" in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, the investigation will stop without immediate additional funding.
Barvela said that she would direct $34 million in the fight against the Zika virus from the National Health Service to seek treatment for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical in-depth research and development body supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including USD 19 million from a programme providing heating oil subsidies to low-income families and USD 4 million from substance dependence programmes such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvela said, extra money will only be enough for the next month, when the agencies will have to 'restraint their activities' in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent $60 million on helping States protect pregnant women, $25 million on strengthening their preparedness for and plans to fight the Zika virus, and $16 million on developing data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with the Zika virus.
Thailand's leader links attacks on tourist attractions with constitutional changes
On Friday, the head of the Thai junta called on the people of the country to be patient until the investigators find out who stands behind the series of fatal bomb explosions that took place in Thailand this week.
General Prajuts Chan-oč, the Head of the junta and Prime Minister, said that criminals were 'bad people' protesting against the new Constitution, which was confirmed by the voters in a referendum held on Sunday.
"We still have bad people, and they were working before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bombs in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in popular places, were killed and injured by dozens.
The authorities claim that incinerators attacks in other countries are linked.
Analysts claim that the aim of bomb explosions was not to kill many people but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhina.
"No matter what the motives, the explosions and the burning attacks overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fasuks, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks give rise to discrediting consequences for public authorities, terrorise society and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thai rescue workers takes care of the bombs in the explosion of the wounded Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or to the protracted Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as "local sabotage" rather than terrorism.
The time and location of the attack have a strong political symbolism.
The bombs took place on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate Queen Siricita’s birthday, which is considered as Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions were destroyed in the royal residence in Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give more powers to the military, even if the government is under civilian control again.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, an expert in South-East Asia at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington DC, pointed out the military suspicion that the attacks were being carried out by dissatisfied people.
The explosives were "precisely coordinated, but obviously aimed at creating fear and excitement, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular Erevan temple in Bangkok.
The Thai officials associated the explosions with Uyghur fighters, who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uyghurs to China.
General Prejuts, who has been leading the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was actively suspended, said that this week's explosion "reduces the hearts of Thais".
Why now, when the country is better when the economy is better and the tourism sector is better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
Gold reaction: how Simones Manuela's historical moment looked
When I started the fight tonight, I tried to remove from my shoulders the black weight of the community, which is something that I just took with me in that position.
However, I hope that all of this will be gone.
I am more than happy with the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we are more, and this is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term black swimmer makes it look like I should not be able to win a gold medal or I should not be able to beat the records.
This is not the case, because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sport and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the defense of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego will get off the shopping centre in Bogota, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World".
His death was the beginning of the contradictions that occurred this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend L.G.B.T. rights were seen in the broader political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reijesa, lodged a complaint with the court against the school officials, blaming them for excluding her only son when it was found that he and his classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court issued a favourable judgment calling for schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of gay rights in Colombia. Some time ago, this year, the movement celebrated the decision to legalise same-sex marriages.
However, this week, they faced an obstacle in their struggle for equality, because Jean Perody, the Minister of Education, who has been openly gay, got a scandal about the application of this rule to the scandal.
The scandal began when sexually discovered content from the pornography magazine began to circulate in social media, spreading to people the talk that it is part of a manual published by the Ministry of Education.
Perodia is an active reflection of this.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on matters related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them pay attention to the rule, it did not attempt to impose the standard rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools for resolving conflicts," said Mrs Perdodia during her interview on Thursday.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks are taking place between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, the FARC, the Partisan Group.
The political coalition of the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church have very quickly mobilized themselves against the government of the President Juan Manuel Santos for promoting the same-sex union and gender change.
In order to make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, which calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks for 42-year-old Perodia, the Colombian political rising star.
They showed up-and-out posters in the myths, and some have also threatened to target violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Alvares-Korrea Glena, former ministers of trade.
The peradium kept the full week of excitement in an amazing state of peace, trying to correct the error and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Partly, what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the consciousness that there are children who will only discover," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and a very lonely time.
She also pointed out the relationship between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be a turning point in the country as a result of the earthquake, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is it a calm country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one that has equal opportunities for all?" she asked the question.
Although she has not been pleased to be the goal of insults and accusations this week, she is pleased that in today's Colombia, gay students can take an example from her and think that they too can try to become ministers one day.
"It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs Perodia.
We cannot expect a new suicide in order to begin to change something.
Keep the vote cyber-drinking - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers away from electoral urns" (Message, August 4)
The Minister for Internal Security, Jah Johnson, says that Obama's administration is thinking about additional security in the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The cyber threat in various manifestations and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections require the federal government to pay additional attention to ensuring our electoral system and perhaps to regard it as part of an essential infrastructure for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions to help with the elections and offer the assistance, advice and guidance of the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The writer, the Democrat from Mississippi, is a member of a high-ranking national security committee.
Boy injured in carousel in Pennsylvania, this week's third case in theme parks
On Thursday, after falling from the carousel, a boy got injuries and was taken to Pittsburgh Hospital. The emergency services and park officials say that this week this is already the third accident in the U.S. theme parks where children have suffered.
The child, whose name is undiscovered, was only taken to a child hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles [80 km] west of Idlewaild and Soukson’s amusement park in Lijonjere, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the Westmurland area’s emergency services.
A three-year-old boy who went with his brother while he was being helped on the ground was consciously informed by the park’s representative Jeff Krušor in an e-mail.
The cross said that the "Rollo Coaster" attraction would be closed for the duration of the event investigation.
Kids must have at least 3 feet (91 cm) long to travel to the carousel and those who are less than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.
According to information published on its website, it was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture stated that it had been tested in August.
The hospital’s representative refused to comment on the health condition of the boy.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Canada.
On Monday, three girls, aged 6, 10, and 16, fell from a height of more than 30 feet (9 meters), and overturned a panoramic wheel basket during the fair in Grīnville, Tennessee, reports the local media.
Prime Minister Abe of Japan will not visit the temple on World War II, which honors the memory of those who died in war: Yi
The news agency, Yi, reports that the Japanese Prime Minister, Sindzo Abe, on the second anniversary of Japan's defeat in the Second World War will not visit the controversial shrine of Tokyo, which honours the memory of those who have died in the war.
On Thursday, Yi reported that Abe was still planning to send Yasukun to the temple a ritual gift in honor of the anniversary.
The temple also honors the memory of 14 Japanese commanders who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea regard it as a symbol of Japan’s wartime militaryism.
As of December 2013, Abbi has not visited the temple when he announced that he had visited it to show respect for those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese defence minister, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the temple, explaining that it is a question of conscience.
Inada - close to Abe's ally and supporter of amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution - has visited Yasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that the Minister of Reconstruction of the areas affected by the Japanese disaster, Masahiro Imamura, visited the temple on Thursday and said that he prayed for Japan’s peace and prosperity.
Relations between China and Japan, two major economies in Asia, have become more tense following the increasing presence of China's coastguard and other national vessels near the controversial islands in the South China Sea, which is known as the ancient Caucasus in Japan and Diaouja in China.
Two suspects in planning the terrorist attacks of Rio Olympic Games are detained: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State in an attack on planning during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to the operation on Thursday, the police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic national fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police reports that three more persons were interrogated and subsequently released.
Both of those arrested on Thursday are Brazilians, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in the history of Brazil with the known militias, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country more relevant, especially because the countries that are fighting the Islamic state are taking part in the games.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has conducted air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilian bombings and bombings.
The new suspected French priest is officially accused of murder
Last month, as part of an investigation of the murder of a French priest, the man arrested on Monday was officially accused, and on Friday Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
The suspected 21 years of age are being investigated for terrorist cooperation, and a source of information was mentioned when he planned to attack people.
The man was telephonely in contact with Adel Kermic and Abdeus Malie Pettgian, who stopped church services in Sentetier in Diocesena, West France, on July 26, and cut a reed to the 85 - year - old Roman Catholic pastor, Father Jacques Amel.
Both police shot.
The suspect had arrived from his home near Toulouse to the Sentetijeen du Ruve and spent the night there in the days before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man who had not previously been criminalized admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the next day because he had no good relationship with Kermitch and Petitgian, said the source of information.
The investigators are trying to find out whether Kermitch and Petitjan had French members and whether they were associated with an Islamic country that has taken responsibility for the attack.
Petitjan's cousin was under pre-trial arrest last month.
Doruss de Vriess goes for medical examination before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club Gatekeeper Doruss de Vriess has arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed at the hospital in Roshol before medical examination after Hoops agreed on the conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
The manager of the Parkhead club Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard to have competition for the current first room for Kreig Gordon.
However, Roger trusts the 35-year-old de Vries because he worked together with the Dutch woman at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which led by Rogers in 2011 won the right to switch to the Prime Minister.
He changed the form of Wales that summer to join Vilnius, and since 2013 he has been a City Ground.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the Dunfermline season, after the transition in 2006.
His stay in Esstendz ended with disappointment, however, when Pars experienced a double agony, being "sent out into exile" from the highest level, before the loss in the Celtic Scottish Cup.
According to the contract, the guard had still a year in the Forest, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
The supermarket giant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step towards helping the chain of shops to advance from potentially oversized problems: in America, it claims to be an online shopping era for too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces its store's portfolio, often closing several duches in an underprofit store immediately after annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer announcement that it will close 15 percent of its 728 outlets, the chains of shops seem to have taken a much more aggressive approach than many similar retailers in terms of reducing the number of their shops, adapting to the very changing shopping environment.
Walkers and buyers go by Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant declares that he plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try something to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the growth of e-commerce.
More difficult times have come for the supermarket category as buyers increasingly choose lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M to buy clothing.
These factors, as a result of short-term difficulties such as the ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonally inadequate weather conditions that Macy's has placed in a fragile situation that has lasted more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter had fallen by 2,6 percent, a rather weak indicator, which nevertheless was an improvement in view of the very poor 6,1 percentage points decrease in the annual percentage point observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenues amounted to USD 5.87 billion (USD 7.64 billion) and 3,9 percent less than in that period last year.
Macy's said that it will cost around USD 1 billion in annual turnover.
And closing such a large number of shops at the same time could be considered to be recognition of the retailer's defeat.
However, the company’s share value dropped by 17 percent on Thursday, indicating that investors perceive this move as a pro-active event telling about Macy’s stronger future.
In a way, the fact that Macy's is reducing the number of shops should not be a surprise.
The retailer’s CEO, Terry Lundgreen, has said in the past that there are simply too many shops in the chain.
The top-level leaders said for some time that they have adopted a new strategy, where special emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable stores, trying to achieve more sales in already profitable outlets.
Jeff Jenette, Macy's director, who has been appointed to Lundgreen as of 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company plans to close are those where sales and profitability are slipping down.
"We are aware that we do not yet get an adequate return on investment in these outlets and that there is often no level of buyer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," said Janete.
The company announced that it would come up with a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that there is still a decision on closing shops and that it is therefore not yet clear exactly how many workers will be made redundant.
The retailer will not completely leave the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing shops located in less active locations.
This move will most likely not like shopping center managers who count on large tenants like Macy's to attract and hold other smaller shops in their shopping centers.
Does your water bottle contain dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles can be "a lot worse than licking your dog's toy", taking into account how many bacteria you will have to face.
Website Treemill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 four different types of water bottles - with screw cap, with flip-off cap, with cap, and with straw.
Each bottle was taken by the athletes for a week without washing.
Your bottle of refilled water can be as dirty as the dog’s toy.
"Considering on the basis of our 12 tested water bottles, we found that re-usable beverages may have an alarmingly large number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (KV/kv.cm)," says the Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest levels of microbes, more than 900 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq.cm).
The bottles had microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with pressed corks were the worst with 162 000 CFU/ sq.cm, while the containers with screw corks had only slightly less than 160 000 CFU/ sq.cm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's dish", is indicated on the website.
A better picture can be seen for straw bottles, where only part of the bacteria in other bottles were found - only 25 CFU/vc.cm.
This may be because water is poured down to the bottom of the straw, not sticking to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
In bottles with straw, the microbes are described as "mostly harmless."
"On the basis of the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, because of both the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," mentioned in the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean places will have fewer microbes.
The website recommends readers to wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must become modern or be forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last surveys prove true also in the elections, in January America will inactivate its first president, a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Maye discussed Britain's withdrawal from European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been raised so that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity thanks to education, ambition and hard work.
And today, young girls can focus on a number of existing models of role, working in the highest field of leadership.
So, is the real long and heavy struggle for equality between women finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women should be consecrated in diacons in the Catholic Church.
The English Church consecrated Libya Leina as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Judaism movement has been assigned to women's rabbins since the beginning of the 1970s and the conservative movement since the beginning of the 1980s, the concept of women's rabbi still has a very severe resistance in orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbi Council published a rather harsh message in its third attempt to halt the growing wave of support for the appointment of Orthodox women in the rabbi series that the concept of woman-rabbi is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as candidates for the office of President of Democrats, the group of American leading Orthodox rabbi, who oppose the coordination of women, began a series of 'debates' on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacral?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, is seeking stability in what it considers to be a long - term traditional value.
This is reflected in the ability to withstand pressure to adapt to the changing society.
Those who are against the coordination of women do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
However, maintaining the tradition of taking over in this way is its own price.
And the price of such one-sided thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition itself by subtracting from the traditional community the oxygen it needs to maintain its vitality.
In the book "High Guns", in the military history of the First World War, Barbara Tačmena emphasizes how dangerous it is to give priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the tragedy of red bees."
Until the beginning of World War I, when war passed from war to war in short distances to the heavier artillery broadcast from a distance away, it became profitable to hide soldiers for as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with boring grey and brown.
However, French soldiers still wear the same red hats and pants that made them easy to use.
The proposal by Adolf Messimi, the French Minister of War, that the armies under his command could do the same, was perceived with ridicule and resistance.
The red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionals were not prepared to abandon it.
In Parliament's speech, former Minister for War Affairs, Eigan, spoke on behalf of France.
"Discard from the red panties?" he cried out.
Never!
"It's an unspeakable and idiotic supplement to the most visible of all colors," wrote the Messiah later, "there should have been evil consequences."
Leaders of faith who are fighting for women's involvement in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking an important question: "What changes are needed in order for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of the talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
To insist that men continue to wear trousers when it comes to religion may be traditional, but this may not be worth it, as the destruction of red bees shows.

The children of Paradise municipality learned new skills in the camp.
From August 1 to 6, the Rojupe Children's and Youth's Initiative Centre held a camp "Varaviksne Bridges", during which participants showed creative expression, sports, as well as acquired new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the closing day, when children with great enthusiasm painted glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, youth specialist at Rojupe Centre for Children and Youth Initiatives, said that this was one of the activities that the participants liked most.
A visit to Einars Kalniņš' carpenter "Mazbrīņi" was also a great joy.
The most popular laser engraving for children was that it was possible to see how the image on the computer was gradually applied to the plate.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be taught in school if he wants to work in carpentery, namely, mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need to work more with the brain than with the muscles in this profession.
There are individual orders in a small workshop and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better, when the camp started, participants took part in various games, as well as together formed the pendants of the camp.
On Wednesday, a walk along the sea from Roja to Zocene took place, and natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used to make cards.
Sports games were also held, which are particularly important for participants.
We went to apartment buildings where we have a sports and recreation area, played football and network bombs.
Children like sports activity, we have many boys who play football, basketball, and each time they demand something sports.
The girls like the quieter things.
On the next day, with the help of a self-hardening mass, we decorated jars, which can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose to speak with themselves, and one evening was devoted to performances.
There were also table games played, each of them could show their knowledge during the photo orientation, where they had to find objects and take photographs.
The task was to get together differently in every picture.
We also painted mandalas - some like more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that will please everyone - sport is closer to the other, creative classes to the other.
"Now it seems that everyone is enthusiastic about painting glass", explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas were issued about creativity, sports, as well as assistance – several children helped in economic works.
The name of the camp "Varaviksne Bridges" has been created because children from three associations participate in it - Rojupe and Melnsils Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multifunctional centre "Strops" of Roja Municipality.
These are unifying bridges.
If the roosters come up with something faster, we borrow ideas; if the other way round, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year, 30 members - children, who were active during the year, were involved in the camp.
"We had predicted 30, and it came," says Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010 when the social service in Roja County decided that families of large children and children of poor families needed to organise camps in the summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Paradise has improved, and the camp is now intended for local residents who come and work in youth centers.
The aim is to spend your free time in a meaningful and comprehensive way.
In the past, two camps took place, each involving 20 children, and now only one camp is organised due to the overall decrease in the number of children in the country.
Similar activities are taking place over the rest of the year.
The children drew, painted glass, Einārs Kalniņš came to the villages, who taught the burning of wood, the making of machines from wood, and saw various shapes with a saw.
There is also a new technique - encaustic, it is coloring with hot wax crystal.
Under the direction of teacher Ilze Šelkova, the classes were made from polymer material, we formed columns and various dishes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, autumn we collect leaves.
We're trying to use what we're around.
The youth centre works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, and from 14.00 to 20.00 in summer.
"The youth centre is visited by 15 children per day on average," says M. Folkmane.
She stressed that Roy County Council was very supportive, which understood that it was necessary to allocate funds to children, because they formed our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only get a season ticket if they sign a behavioural agreement" and agree not to criticise the club in social media.
Although we recognise that everyone has the right to his or her personal opinion, publishing confusing comments on such websites does not work for the benefit of them.
The fan working in the field of administration was then told that he would have to get a ticket personally from the former senior police officer Klif Eger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police force.
The letter goes on to say: "I must inform you that the granting of a seasonal ticket will be renewed to you on condition that you sign the "Harmonised Conduct Contract" (ABC), which will stipulate that you will continue to refrain from publishing derogatory or embarrassing comments about people representing a club or a club in all kinds of social media websites, or any other conduct that might be considered antisocial."
When talking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket was paid, which was not received, and two days later a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "deleted", making others as well laughable."
Cycling holidays on the shores of division
What do you mean by the word "pregnancy"?
I was driving here with all my strength," said Colina, the former U.S. Navy Commander, who has just driven a 25-mile cycle along the central part of a rough Croatian island, without leaving anything there, except a spiesy expression of sweat and lush sailors cast out in hostile mountains.
Some bicyclists sing anthems or a number of kindergarten poems to make it easier to get on the mountain.
Colin’s friend Petty recommends “The Little Engine That Cover. ”
Others do not live up to their numbers, or they simply suffer from silence, thinking about what it requires to get to a trance-like condition that hardy cyclists are talking about.
Colin’s lama is poisonous rather than diverse.
Going a few yards ahead for her is as if Hu Grant were going after the movie "Cathra wedding and one funeral" at the beginning.
Her and my mission is a week long "luxury" yacht and a cycling trip along the northern coast of Croatia and the islands, organised by Freedom Treks.
While cycling in summer heat on a steep hilly place like Croatia perhaps does not match everyone's understanding of luxury, it is said that Northern Dalmatisation is easier to leave than Southern Dalmatation, our fifth wheel is soft, and when we filled in reservation forms, freely and convincingly all those months ago, there was a box that we did not mark, which could have been provided by an e-bicycle charged to us.
The luxury part of the transaction is our floating house for a week, the very new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bikes into a pile at our guides Ivan and Ivana, and at the stern of the ship jump into blue water without coming into contact with sea-cows, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone bands called the beach by the Croatians.
In June, the water temperature at sea is perfect, and everyone agrees: Cool enough to cool, but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing rubs and some kayaks if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the blankets.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioning, where Helena, the ship's massager - I'm not kidding - will already have our beds, our minibar supplies and have left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that biking is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to jump out on our beds or on the top deck with cushions, along with bartender Antonio, who is always ready to make one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, not a exalted superjahta, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It is turning to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Collin and Petia are part of a meetup.com group of friends from Washington, D.C. (Colombia area): sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s barren and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands had been so successful that they decided to try something even more richer for adventures, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is sailing and cycling on holidays in Provence, and every afternoon air is tightened by the pingpong rally of competing Facebook publications.
The holiday adventure element may be exaggerated because our schedule is nothing if no specific mode is set.
"Brokastis and dinner are eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started the road from the beautiful old port of Trogira, near Split.
One sign of the ship’s call indicates that the cupboard is open, while the other calls for quietness at the end of the meal and carefully listen to the information.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that may have been lost everywhere, but not in British contingent.
Whatever the difference - fun has already assumed speed, jokes jumping out of abundance, while Ivana releases daily excursion cards, but we all pretend that we are frightened by swings, contours and profiles with rises and falls, even though anything else would be a surprise on the Croatian cycle, which begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Complete flatness is not recommended.
Ivan hosts an information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, the Germans, the Americans and the British, who easily sit at tables where English is spoken at two and German at one.
We're all friends on the road.
Cycling contributes to friendship, and the only competition is inside, i.e. with itself.
I do not remember when the group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxing.
Soon we're on Ivan's wave.
A small rise is a slope, which should not be confused with inequality, which is a good thing.
Matadatas are serpentins and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
The instructions for cycling are always the same: "Drive one by one, stop the distance, and it's not a race.
See you on the shoreside in nine.
Okay, five couples, I forgot you were on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
From Trogira we will go north on a two-day cruise through the Kornati Archipelago, where we will take off the Dugi Otok - Croatian "long island" - and after a little sleep we will go on a walk along the Telaschcica Nature Park to admire its steep rocks and salt lake, where seawater flows into the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it with its strength become younger.
If we do that, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn south again, moving from the continent to the nearby islands apparently by accident.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads along the outside of the country with wide sea views and a diverse plant country: olive cone, vineyards, sharp plant glasses, Mediterranean smells and countless butterflies on flight.
As we go ahead, there's always a break, but when Ivan calls us to stop, there's always a big shadow, and the little piles are like a prize for those who come faster.
Sports and public activists go a lot on cycling weekends, and they know the standards of conduct by sending warnings in a row and leaving open space so that motorists can take the rollover manoeuvres much more safely.
"You almost got hit," one cyclist says to the other after the truck driver decided to perform a rollover manoeuvre in an opaque bend and quickly braked.
Happily, the brakes were running.
The Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short section of driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the right back to encourage and "stack up", as Ivan says.
If you have to cross the main road, we all come together, get off the bikes and safety after the transitions with our bikes on the other side as we are instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan understands that he doesn't talk to a group of children?" asks a Swiss cyclists when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoon can be dedicated to a happy rest.
The city’s visit to Zadar unveils the Roman Forum and the Sea Organs, playing music that sounds like the role of an incarcerated maritime monster, through stone-integrated pipes in promenade and open to the water.
The famous sunset of Zadara falls perfectly between the main dish and the bottle, and after the dark has entered, we return to the sea organs and watch the wave-driven lamp games in the glass trotula, which is in fact the dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way early in the morning to the bustling Biograd resort, organ song is no longer just a joke.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the lake estuary to see its waterfalls; then a tour of the afternoon in Sibenica, where we see the Cathedral of thought, the work of the Dalmatia Renaissance, as well as a chair-time walk on the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, make this day interesting.
Lourda is going to take the pilgrims in the shadow of the attack
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gather at Lourda Our Lady's temple.
The French security forces are in high alert state, since thousands of Catholics gather at the Lourdes temple on an annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several acts of terrorism.
Each August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains for the Ascension Festival to mark the reception of Mary the virgin in heaven.
This year's pilgrimage takes place at a time when the Catholics have been shocked by the murder of an older French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who invading the church in the north of France during the Mass and cut his throat.
The murder of Jacques Amel took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- the investigators claim that he was radicalized by the Jihadist on-line video materials,-- got hit by a truck at the celebration of Bastile Day in Nice, Riviera, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks over 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists fell sharply, and the authorities were concerned that this year’s number of pilgrims could fall rapidly.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say that there has even been an influx of visitors' applications at the last moment.
The arrival of some 25 000 believers is expected, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation from some 200 members of the Eastern branch of Christianity - Orthodox.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not allow intimidation.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian said to AFP, describing prayer as the "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life continues," said Matier Guinean - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, or our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about security in France, a number of large-scale events have been abolished since the attack in Nice, including a huge stock market in the northern town of Lille and the European Road Cycling Championship, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone will call in one call to cancel applications," said Fabien Ležesne last weekend, a priest responsible for the official conduct of pilgrimage.
"On the contrary, it seems that attacks have mobilised believers," he said and announced the influx of recent applications.
Kristiāns Gels, the head of the trade association of local hotel workers, confirmed "increased interest" in pilgrimage after the attacks.
About the temple, where the virgin Mary appeared to the poor shepherd Bernadet Subir in 1858, there were extremely strict safety measures.
Approximately 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the site, including bomb neutralisation experts and explosive detection experts in dogs.
As the temples swung through the security barriers, bags were tested at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled on a pilgrimage from northeast England to Lourde at the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"By Thursday morning, armed guards were present in the temples, and then they could enter only one through the gates (with metal barriers) and the bags were searched," she said.
"This all frightened my three children, who are accustomed to Lourda, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why it happened," she said.
It did not spoil my impressions, but it saddened me that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these events.
The course of the opening process on Friday has also been shortened - instead of starting up in Lourde and moving on to the temple, it will begin and end at the temple.
Other measures include the closure of the air space for flights over Lourda, the closure of streets near the traffic shrine and the replacement of waste bins to transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister for the Interior, Bernārs Kazenev, will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lourde every year, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic pilgrimage.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in the cave where Bernadette saw Mary, believing in the therapeutic properties of water.
In Thierry Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual", taking into account "the threat that roots seem to be found in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
François, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that, in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothes was "a little depressing."
However, if it calms everyone down, it is good.
The Zaragoza shopping centre is shot by two injured people
Two people were seriously injured after a man discovered a fire at the shopping centre of Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the people's full Aragonia shopping centre in Zaragoza.
Initial reports show that a shooter might have shot a woman who could be his former partner.
After the shooting, an armed criminal fled and is currently being searched by the police.
Last night, 12 drunkards and four aggressive drivers were caught.
Yesterday, 12 drunkards and four aggressive drivers were caught on Latvian roads, informed the State Police.
Four of the stopped drinkers were in Zemgale, three in the Riga region, two in Kurzeme and Latgale, and one in Vidzeme.
All four aggressive drivers have been stopped in the Riga region.
In turn 218 administrative violation protocols have been drawn up for exceeding the authorised speed.

46 protocols were made in Zemgale, 36 protocols in Vidzeme, 26 protocols in Latgale and 22 protocols in Kurzeme.
The opening of the waterfowl hunting season is coming.
Every second Saturday of August, the waterfowl hunting season is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 on August 13, therefore the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with security regulations.
While waterfowl hunts take place not only on hunting grounds but also in public water bodies, while weather conditions do not give rise to heat as a result of other years, it is permissible for restorators to use these bodies together with hunters.
Both hunters, holidaymakers and water bodies are encouraged to be particularly careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not threatening themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, the State Police will also carry out enhanced hunting control in cooperation with the State Forest Service this year.
During the control, law enforcement officers will focus on compliance of arms and ammunition movement with the norms of the law, as well as will monitor that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and intoxicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms in waterbird hunting is prohibited with a total capacity of more than three cartridges, including by referring to amendments to the Law on the Movement of Arms and Special Means, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with spirit-powered firearms or large-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport and during a short stop period of up to two hours when these weapons are carried to or from hunting have the right to keep a weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but must be placed as safely as possible in a place where the funnel or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons are not visible from the outside of the vehicle and are fitted with an alarm device, thereby ensuring that they do not accidentally enter into the hands of unauthorised persons.
The police call to take care of their safety and that of their peers during the hunting season and, if you consider offences or a threat to security, we invite you to report immediately by calling 110.
In the event of any danger, the law enforcement authorities shall be prepared to respond to the information provided by the public.
The coasts of New Caledonia are hit by a 7,2 magnified earthquake
On Friday, the 7.2-magnith earthquake shocked the coast of New Caledonia, told seismologists that there was no tsunami threat.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of nine kilometres 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia Illatere at 1.26 after Greenich (at 4.26 post-Latvian time), reported by the U.S. Geology Research Centre.
The Pacific tsunami alert centre indicated that there are currently no warnings or recommendations concerning possible tsunami threats for the region.
"The earthquakes in this region are not unusual as well as recent activities are not unusual," said chief seismologist of Geoscience Australia, Phil Kamins.
It could potentially be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt that it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Uguns Ring" - the Pacific tectonic activity area, where earthquakes and volcanoes eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open their checkpoints at the border between both countries, which was closed a year ago at Venezuela's initiative, and on Thursday the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nicolas Maduro, were told.
Originally, border points will only be open to pedestrians.
From Saturday, five border points will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 20 p.m.
It will be possible to open the border for transport after separate international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, as indicated by the Presidents.
In August of the last year, Maduro ordered the closure of the border in response to an attack by Colombian fighters against the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
This July Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice because of the sharp economic crisis - the Venecells in poverty tried to break through the border to buy first-needed goods in border stores.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time our time for one of Latvia's prides, sympathetic Madaras Palmeikas.
Madara Palameika was born on June 18, 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian lightline, which has started to be a thread-throwing competition.
Her coach is Father Gint Palameik.
The Latvian recordist was sniffing.
He took part in the 2012 Summer Olympics, participated several times in the World and European Championships (the 4th place in 2014 European Championship), and won 3rd place in the 2015 Diamond League overall.
Facebook declares a fight against advertising lockers.
Facebook, the most used social network in the world, has sent a warning shot, meaning that blocking advertising banners with special tools is unacceptable and users will also have to watch advertising.
The popularity of special advertising lockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is direct advertising are declining.
Facebook has now made it clear that he understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
However, they will be provided with tools to choose the type of material they are showing themselves, reported by BBC.
"As we provide more and more control for people, we will also start to show advertising to those who use advertising blocking software," said Andrew Bosvort, Vice President of Facebook's advertising business.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see advertising that doesn't apply to them or interfere with content enjoying," says Bosvort.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices are usually not working, which leads to the largest visit to Facebook, but the reduction in banner exposure is also measured in billions of euros in terms of money.
According to BBC, advertising blockers are used by some 200 million people.
It has already been reported that, in the previous quarter of the business year, Facebook revenue from advertising amounted to USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It has to be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news flows.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove from the news streams or at least limit it to "scarring" headlines, behind which "empty" messages actually lie.
At night in Brīvības Street, asphalt works will be carried out; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
Tonight in the section of Brīvības Street from Berzaunes Street to Gustava Zemgale Street, asphalt application works will be performed, therefore drivers have to take into account limited traffic at this section of the street.
As the agency LETA learned about Riga City Council, traffic restrictions will begin this stage from 21 a.m. this evening and asphalt works will last until 12 a.m. on 12 August 7.
The traffic in the direction to Juglu will be directed along the tram tracks.
Drivers must take into account the limited traffic at this stage and the extra time spent on the road.
The municipality calls for understanding of the restrictions imposed and compliance with the traffic organisation’s procedures.
The renewal of the cover started on the main streets of the capital city - Brīvības iela from Riņa boulevard to Lāčplēša iela and from the Air Bridge to Juglas iela, Lāčplēša iela from the Salu bridge to Avotu iela, Juglas iela from Kžāle to Maliens iela and Lielvardes iela from Dzelzavas iela to 84.vidusskola.
Construction works will last until the beginning of the new school year and are organised continuously, also during night hours, when asphalt is mostly applied.
Medvedev's deputy in Riga met several ZZS ministers secretly.
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, Arkadij Dvorkovics, met three Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS) ministers secretly last week when he visited Riga in a fish processing plant.
Informal meeting took place at the fish processing plant "Kija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola took part in the meeting, the Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and the Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, the internet portal "sikies.lv".
The fact that such a meeting has taken place has been approved by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting she was talking about lifting sanctions for fish processors, as well as about the Inčukalns gas storage.
A meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, has taken place without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The event was organized by the Russian Ambassador Aleksandrs Vesņakovs.
Suspected of misappropriation of more than €130 000 by the accounting officer.
The State Police (VP) Economic Crime Agency (ENAP) this month informed the BNS representative, Gita Gžibovska, about 130,000 misappropriation from a Riga commercial company, who had been detained by an accountant who has been working for 20 years.
Current information shows that the suspected woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has together caused more than €130,000 losses to the company.
Given that the company’s officials had not closely followed the cash flow and trusted their staff, they only learned about the ongoing machinations after several years.
VP ENAP police officers detained the suspected woman born in 1963 this month and conducted a search in the company.
Criminal proceedings for misappropriation, if committed to a large extent, have been initiated in connection with the events.
The law on such crimes provides for deprivation of liberty for a period of up to ten years, either by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure which is not linked to deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia, antibodies to the Zika virus have been detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people have developed antibodies to the Zika virus, which means that they may have been exposed to the infection, reports the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year the Zika virus tests were carried out on 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
In Finland and Sweden, the first cases of Zika have been reported in Estonia.
Data from the Estonian Health Administration indicate that no acute Zika virus infection in the country has been reported and that people do not need to have a Zika virus test but have to seek advice from their family doctor in case of flu-like symptoms.
We have found IgG (immunoglobulin G class) antibodies that show that the subject is at some point infected with Zick or similar virus.
"It doesn't mean that the patient is infected with the Zika virus," explained Pauls Nabers, Head of the Department of infectious diseases in Synlab.
The zika virus is transmitted by "Aedes."
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of high-quality car purchases, in an interview to the agency BNS said the vice-president of the Auto Association Ingus Rūtiņš.
Taught, or there are obvious problems with dumped prices in the car sector procurement, Rūtiņš replied in a positive way.
Of course.
Car purchases are different from service purchases where prices are easier to manipulate.
As a result, a certain amount must in any case be paid by the car as it has to be bought from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the advertiser is incompetent and does not know how to create quality procurement, which, often without being aware of it, is the result of "revenue".
"Does the very conscious procurement be built to get something concrete, and there are all kinds of miracles that can be seen there," the vice-president of the Auto Association said.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the winner of procurement, but some of the public still have a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria have to be established in both cases and when they have been taken into account and assessed, the decision is still made on the basis of the lowest price.
Technical criteria for qualitative procurement should be very precise and market-compliant.
Points, on the other hand, do not need to assess anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
The points do not need to assess fuel consumption, emissions, services and similar things.
It is the expected life cycle of a car, a run, etc. that can be taken together, too.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is interested the customer himself?" explained Rūtiņš.
In turn, the project manager of the Auto Association Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for both cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one example.
We have also been consulted on the spare parts of procurement samples, which were difficult to name in a different way than in a detailed absurd.
"The problem is that the contractor very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and demands are simply copied from somewhere", said Rubulis.
Rūtiņš, in turn, added that the smaller the structure that announces the procurement, the bigger the problems.
"I guess this is precisely because of the lack of human resources and expertise," said the vice-president of the Association.
Latvian volleyballists are not up to the fight for medals.
Latvian beach volleyball duet Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš left the Rio Olympics tournament on Thursday, sticking to (1-2) hosts Evandrs Gonsalveš Oliveir and Pedro Solbergs Salgadas.

"Die Antwoord" accused "Death Unit" of stealing style.
South African group "Die Antwoord" accused the director of the film "Sicide Sqaud" on Thursday of the use of the unique appearance of the group without permission, calling the respected director a "small-haunted" .
The group's leading singer, Jolandi, turned to the director of the film studio Warner Bros, in his mobile app Instagram, saying, "It's right, David Ajer, you're stealing our style."
As she claims, the film stars Karas Delavinja and Jared Leto said that Air was yours on the "Die Antwoord" filming field.
"But you didn't require permission to cheat us," the singer pointed out.
A 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja had a text message in this matter to Aier, but he "did not answer anything, like a little scared of a bitch."
Jolandi insists that Ajer caught up his scenes from the introca of the 2011 "Umshini Wam" short film, which shows the duo of the southern African hipup.
She has also published a video that seems to prove that Aier Joker and Harley Quinn's images have been taken from the appearance of both singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration of the Joker image is the imitator of rock musician David Bowie.
Jolandi's claim is presented in conclusion by rebutting to the harsh assessment of critics made by the film after the premiere.
Jolandi and Ninja, in their true words, Henri du Tuata and Watkins Tudor Jones, gained fame with three recordings of the repa studio, promoting African Zef's counterculture.

Turkey seeks the missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats, who did not return with the staff withdrawn after an attempt at the coup of 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavušogls said on Friday that 208 Turkish ministerial staff were withdrawn from the jobs worldwide for the period of the coup attempt investigation into Ankara, and 32 have disappeared "without permission".
Some 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from office in Turkey, with the government considering them loyal to US-based official Fetulla Gulen, who it is accused of developing a government action plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most wanted people in Turkey.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice later this month will arrive on a visit to Turkey to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a NATO member state.
The US objected to the strong arms tactics of the Turkish President, Regžep Tajjipa Erdogan, after the coup, and Turkey responded to this in an effort to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, that the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials fled to New York in Bangladesh, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryet, quoting military sources, reported that the Turkish military attaché in Jordan was missing.
Wall Street Journal, citing an U.S. official who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in the NATO Command Centre in Virginia had requested asylum in the U.S.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," said the broadcaster NTV during an interview with Kavosoglu.
Since yesterday, time has come to an end for those who were originally withdrawn.
We will take legal action against those who have not returned.
The organizers of the Olympic Games are trying to clear the green dive pool
The Olympic divers, for which training was scheduled on Friday, came to a closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean up the green water before the first individual competitions in Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the middle of a synchronised diving race.
The organizers claimed that even after the larger nearby pool for water polo and synchronised swimming was safe, the water race also became green.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes arrived for morning warming, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 after local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women's 3 meter race.
The color of the water looked closer to its usual color, but still with green color.
Abby Johnson, an American dive who competes for a tramp, told her that she only came to the warmup to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp (refine the bog) should be in fashion.
The British divers Tom Daley, who won the bronze in the synchronous diving of the platform, also commented on the status of the pool.
Hopefully, this means that in the last few days we've never gone in like a very bad thing!
Mario Andrad, the main speaker of the local committee of organisers, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions, giving the green light to the pre-selections of 3 meters.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of the efforts to clean the pool.
"We repeat many times what we have said all the time - water does not in any way threaten the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water once again, and that was fully in line with the parameters.
Simon Langford, the main speaker of the Marija Pole Water Sport Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world's leading organisation, the FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue colour as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrad said that the deterioration of the pool had surprised the organisers unprepared.
"Chemical is not an accurate science," he said.
Some things you can see last longer.
In the last few days, getting a rainwater color in the normal state made it even more difficult.
"The rains don't work," Andrad said.
He added that in the morning athletes had access to dry training, but admitted that it "was not perfect."
He explained that the change in the colour of the pool was due to an increase in alkalin levels, just as aquarium water can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something about green, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water, because athletes train in it," said Andrad.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent water becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports visitors Jay Cohen and Steve Wade in Rio de Janeiro participated in this action.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication, will hold a forum
However, Shanghai and Taipei will host the annual city forum from August 22 to 23 in Taipei, announced on Friday the municipality of Shanghai despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
High-level municipal official Sha Hailin Shanghai Mayor Janga Xionga will lead a delegation on behalf of the forum by notifying the Government of Shanghai of its official microblog account with Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been organised in rotational order of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as healthcare, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, with a view to "developing the exchange of experience and cooperation on various aspects" between both cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has not acknowledged the agreement reached in 1992 which strengthened the principle of one China since the new leader, Tsai Ing-ven, took office in May, which has led to a suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguangs, spokesman of the State Council of the Taiwanese Affairs Bureau on land, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side stops at the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experience between cities on both sides," said MA, stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and exchange of experience between cities should be interpreted correctly.
The President of Uganda meets with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the President of Uganda, Jover Museveni, thanked China for its continued support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is an ancient friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the African continent's release from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Tanzania-Zambian railway in the 1970s as proof of Chinese generous support, even when China itself was not particularly prosperous.
Museveni said that China has pursued multilateral cooperation with Uganda through both infrastructure and business investments and cultural exchanges, and added that this type of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply provided financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in different ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and in the construction of an industrial park.
He also calls on Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Wang She praised Uganda's efforts in the fields of industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal cooperation partner for Uganda.
Wang stated that China is ready to do its utmost to help implement Uganda's economic and social development and added that China's cooperation with Uganda is genuine and without any political considerations, as it is based on a high level of political credibility and a proven friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial park and support the development of energy and agricultural sectors in this East African people.
