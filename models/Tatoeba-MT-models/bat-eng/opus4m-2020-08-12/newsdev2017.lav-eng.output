New questions on the California water project
Critics and the state legislator say that they want to know in more detail who is paying for the USD 16 billion project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a representative of the leading California Water Supply Authority, that the Brown Administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Authority may run counter to the state’s long-standing claims that the different local water supply authorities, not California itself, would pay for Brown’s vision of digging two equal 35-mile tunnels to run the water south of the River Sacramento, mainly for Central and Southern California.
The initial construction costs of USD 248 million for tunnels, which, although still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, have already begun to be the subject of a federal audit.
On Wednesday, state legislators also ordered a state audit on tunnel construction costs.
On Thursday, State Spyker Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Water Supply Authority in Los Angeles, the money from the general budget of the State will not be used to complete the current programming phase of the twin tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly representative Susan Ega, one of the state legislators standing behind the audit this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with toes," said David Wolf, legal director of Howard Jerry's Taxpayer Association.
In my opinion, it coincides with yesterday's audit (requests): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply authorities and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide a safer water supply for the Californians.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Gulf, to the detriment of Northern California and to further threaten local species.
Metropolis and other water supply authorities, which are supposed to receive water from tunnels, still have to make a commitment to pay for it because of insecurity as to whether the huge investment will actually provide sufficient water to repay it.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project first obtained the approval of the monitoring authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority on the tunnel project states that "the State has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be provided from the state or federal budget."
After all that local water authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water administration, the state is expected to use public money to complete their planning," said Bob Muir, a speaker at the Los Angeles water administration.
Then he directed questions to Vogel, a state spy.
Vogela said that the state plans to allocate money to complete tunnel planning from the fee for the existing half a century-old water network, the State Water Project.
However, opponents of tunnel construction point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which, according to them, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction until the water supply institutions that will benefit from it will assume payment obligations for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these obligations," said Patricija Schiferle, environmental consultant and long-standing opponent of planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was found suddenly.
Addressing the Business Group in the context of the Chinese Cyber Security Act
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cyber security rules, warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to Prime Minister Li Kecjan of China has been signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concerns that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that it could make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders are planning silent commemoration events to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion in which 173 people died, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, the anniversary of such a disaster would be a moment that the people remember and commemorate.
Not in China, however.
Although the city of Taijina retains a memorial service for the memory of some dead fire-fighters, in other places such commemorative activities are excluded.
The media under the control of the Communist Party are told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors and family members of the dead are warned not to talk to the foreign press.
However, 23 - year - old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
"On this anniversary, society should somehow know what happened," he says.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator at a military fire brigade just a mile away from the explosion epicentre.
"The call was received that night at 22.53, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could come to the scene within 10 minutes.
Teams from other parts of the city also rushed to clear the large fire chemical warehouse.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, well above the permitted levels and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when it was permitted that the batch of nitrocellulose - chemicals used in nail varnishes - was dried up and then the summer greeting was set to fire.
Then it spread into a huge area of 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
In the explosions windows and fire depots, Zhang Mengfan was waiting for news from the radio panel from the scene, and the roof broke.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firemen of his unit who were sent to the place of explosion that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered severe burns and other injuries.
The biggest of the two major explosions was likened to an earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than USD 1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In total 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firemen.
Eight human remains have not been found.
The investigation authorities of the official government clearly blame corruption, political relations and formal collusion, which led to circumvention of the rules and disregard of security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built near the house.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the company’s management have been involved in any disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress made - thousands of houses and compensations for citizens - these sensitive issues remain relevant.
The tragedy has revealed gaps in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent monitoring is a fact.
That evening’s courage and sense of duty are unquestionable, but without a firefighter as a hero, there is not a very satisfying scene.
It has a firefighter as a victim who has been sent without prior knowledge in the fight against a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works at the fire service, but will attend the memorial church service in Tianjin.
He will send out a message in his heart about his dead fellow believers.
Most of all, I would like to tell them: I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I'll do your sonship.
The cold spring could affect the Scottish rubbing season
The Scottish ruble shooting season will start later, as the number of birds has decreased this year due to cold weather.
In several properties, shooting has been postponed because many of the young rubies have not survived during the cold spring.
Commemorating the beginning of the season, the Scottish Gaming Operators Association (SGA) reports that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festivals.
However, the OneKind Animal Protection Charity Fund calls for an end to the murder of 'brutal birds'.
Harry Houston, director of the organization, said: "The work that is invested in providing a large number of shooting game birds is huge and undoubtedly involves some rather controversial activities."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary work enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
However, landowners insist that they commit themselves to maintaining the number of birds and that the shooting of rubles is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA Chairman Alex Hog said that the industry provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the outermost regions and that it has been a "rich work patch" in insecure times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland is not so well-rooted in the "hunting" culture, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the country economically."
Hog said, during the shooting, the number of jobs exceeds the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the fringe festival, the tattooing festival and the Old Year's evening celebrations together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is quite worrying at the moment, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game operators and their families want to see the industry flourish.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubble.
Many game organizers admit that the shooting of rubles is not generally popular, but the SGA states that the industry "has taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice".
The day of opening of the rubbing season is traditionally known as the Holy Twelve.
However, there is still much discussion about this sport and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to persecution by some nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years, in the mountains of Monadliath, southeast of Invernes, eight ringed golden eagles disappeared.
According to the Nature Conservation Charity Fund, they have been illegally killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
The Scottish Environment Minister, Rosanna Kaningham, said that these reports are "very worrying and sad."
Mrs Caningham instructed the officials to analyse evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters in order to determine whether there was a trend towards criminal activity.
A group of Scottish ravens blamed the RSPB for trying to stir up their senses of fire before the start of the rubble season, and said that there was no clear evidence that the birds had even died in the mountains of Monadlit.
Rio Olympics 2016: Brionie Peige wins silver in tramp jumping
British representative Paige wins silver for trampling
Brionie Paige has become the first British woman to join the medal at the Olympics in a trampling game, winning the silver in Rio.
Paige (25) lacked 0.425 points to gold because Canada's representative, Rosanna McLenan, won the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56.465.
World champion, Chinese representative Lee Dana was at the bronze, while the second British finalist Catherine Driscol finished at the sixth.
I can't believe I won the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said Emotional Paige.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the trainings and hard work had paid off.
I'm so happy that I was able to finish with Kett, and one representative would be historical, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic Silver Championship, Peidja's highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
It was included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to reach the end.
Reaction to a medal.
Nathan Bailey, a British team representative, was the only representative in men's competition for trampling on Saturday, in ecstasy.
Hannah Velana, who takes part in the Olympic Games for the second time, quickly began to praise Peige’s achievement.
Paige has acquired a bachelor in biology with excellence at Sheffield University.
Rio 2016: Fiji's fans celebrate the gold medal in rugby-7
A 12-year-old boy to see the game, drown half a mile of sugar cane fields to the nearest TV
Fiji begins an unprecedented celebration after the first Olympic gold medal in its history
Banks closed, shops closed and celebrations took over Suvas streets, dancing, singing and enjoying
Fiji won a gold medal at Deodore stadium rugby-7 finals with 43-7 destroying Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country stopped their routines in order to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in its history
Many of the fans were dressed in Fiji’s colors and rugby shirts, carrying the national flag and encouraging the team.
When the end of the game was seen in the whistle, the excited celebrationrs went on the streets, exulting and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the people's full streets of Suva and joined the celebrations with Fiji's flags, don't turn to the slight congestion they created," reports Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue during the weekend and next week.
Prime Minister of Ireland: Finn Sharps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McKenef hit two first half-time punishments for a guest team in Finn Park.
Derry City has risen to the second one in the Premier League, winning a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight with Finn Sharps.
Aaron McNef brought the "confect stripe" under the direction of successfully implementing two first half-time punishments, which were awarded for violations against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boy entered the gate at the beginning of the second half of the day, and Schubert beat the opponent in the fourth quarter before Keith Ward's late play, closing the enemy's ruin in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the crucial game on Monday evening in Brendiwell.
It was Derry's first victory over his north-west competitors in this season, and they were disrupted on the side of the HARPS.
McNef saved the game's opening strike 17 minutes after Kürran Cole's walk to Schubert, even though the violation turned out to be outside the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second hit by former "King stripe" semi-guard Barry Molo, making Schubert fall to the ground and making McNef a result 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boy put the exact point after Dean Jarvis's game with his foot inside the eighth minute after the game resumed.
Derry City goalkeeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet evening, but he managed to protect the gate perfectly, overcoming David Scallie in the best opening of the game.
Schubert took the ball past Colla before he broke out 83 minutes, and this was soon followed by a wise wrestling over Richard Brass, the protector of the Sharps Center.
It was Derry's biggest victory in the race series and a great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after mass trials at the Invernes College University of Higher and Island (UHI)
The entire 20 student course could have failed in the UHI Highest Media Course of the Invernes College.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - olds who hoped to use the study record to join the university.
The Invernes College claims that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates the case.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the 2016 highest media evaluation available throughout the country is "noticing as intended".
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by Invernes College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who had their studies online, but often had to go to Invernes College from their places of residence, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after the publication of his daughter in social media that she had not received any evaluation of her work, at least 10 more announced that she had not received any evaluation of her course work.
He said on the BBC News Scotland direct that about five more people who attended the Invernes College last year, and who managed to communicate, said that the same happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at Glasgow University, but she will be able to accept another university's offer thanks to the qualifications acquired at school.
However, her father said that there were others who attended a media course organized by the college, who failed and who were now "forgotten" and insecure about whether their course work would be reviewed and rated so that they could join universities.
Invernes College UHI is part of the University of Highland and Island.
Diāna Rovlinsone, head and executive director of Invernes College UHI, said: "The results of our exams and the success of students are very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review received by Her Majesty Education Inspectorate (HMIE) this year, as well as improved achievement levels in both further education and higher education compared to last year.
As every year, we carry out a full review of published results, comparing them with the forecasts of each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out and the evaluation body recently reported "significant improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "assessments were in line with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
SQA Press Secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been carried out as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in A-C performance compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers placed in prison for Samjurai sword "blood alcohol" in Kilmarnoka
Jason Braden was attacked with a samurai sword, a knife and nunchaks
Two brothers in prison for killing a man with a samurai sword after the drug-related theft in Airshire, which turned into "blood alcohol".
The victim Jason Braden (38) was repeatedly stabbed at his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
In Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to murder.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less serious charges of murder without prior intent.
When both men were sentenced to prison, Judge Bill Danlop told their brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlops added: "You are planning illegal entry with at least one knife and nunchaks."
Jason Braden may have been a drug addict, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After the arrest of both men in prison, a criminal police officer, who led the investigation, said: “Jon and James Clark’s violent and terrible actions have resulted in the death of Jason Braden. ”
At 38 years of age, there is a heartbreaking situation that the family is going through under such terrible circumstances.
The court heard earlier that the Kilmarnoka brothers had decided to seize Mr. Braden’s gold bracelet, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, went to his house, masked their faces with scarves, and armed with a knife and an Eastern battle with nunchaks.
The sword used for murder is believed to have belonged to the dead.
The neighbors said they saw Clarkus attack Braden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard him screaming.
Public Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the court hearing: "The attack on this man was perilous, chaotic."
Then the murder site was described as "blood alcohol".
In addition to injuries from knife stitches, Braden suffered a severe injury with a tunny object during his attack.
Three days later, he died at the Kilmarnoka Croshaus Hospital.
Both brothers didn't confess the murder.
In providing evidence, James Clark, who had already been tried 38 times before, including the attempted murder, said, "I didn't want it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who had been tried 23 times before, said that he was just involved in helping a brother who he said had been attacked by Braden."
A man has been sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his baby’s son
David Sincler admitted his guilt at the murder of a child in his home in East Cilbraid in 2012.
A man who shaked and killed his baby children in an outburst because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sincler searched four-month-old Joshua when he "lost control for a moment" at their home in East Cilbred, South Lancashire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was determined only after a judicial medical examination.
Sincler (34) was initially accused of murder but was found guilty of murder without prior intent.
In the High Court of Glasgow, when sentenced to prison, Judge Lord Breiseidl said to Sinkler: "You attacked your baby's son by shaking him, creating injuries from which he died."
When you searched him, you should have known it, but you didn't reveal it.
You should know what you are doing only after thorough medical examination.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels betrayed and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as "catatrophic" to everyone and added, "Nothing will return Joshua."
The court had previously found that, on the day when the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Curty, had gone with Joshua to swim and shop in the East Breed.
At 17.30 Cursty Sinklere went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who sounded "shocked."
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like she does, come home now."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to a hospital in Hermara, where he died.
The cause of Joshua’s death was not clear at first, but he was examined by a team of medical experts who found the consequences of injuries in the eyes and brain shortly before death, and such injuries were not possible by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a child neurosurgeon at John Redcliff's hospital in Oxford, said: "This has happened because the child has been shaken and has thus suffered injuries, as well as been touched with more strength than in everyday life."
The defence representative, Jan Duwigid, told the court that Sincler was "extremely sorry" for what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloy Tatone undermines the positions of Julia Jephimova
British representative Tatone slips out of her hands at a sea of 200 m
The British representative Chloy Taton criticises the participation of the controversial swimmer Julia Jefimova in the Rio Games after the Russian representative overtakes her 200 m of bathing.
Jefimova, who was allowed to play after a complaint concerning the prohibition of participation due to doping, won silver, leaving Taton in fourth place.
"I would have liked them to be pure games," said a 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I didn't know who was.
I'm not satisfied with that, but it is.
Jephimova, who won second place, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to take part in competitions, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Caneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in the 2016 matches in Rio, overcoming Jephimov, who was at the silver medal.
China's representative, Jeanlinga Shoe, was at bronze, just six hundredths of seconds ahead of the fourth single Taton.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renshova, finished at six.
"Keeping in fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you're in front of," added Taton.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, meeting in the final is a great experience that I will take with myself for the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly wanting a medal, so I hope I'll get closer to it next time.
The Tatone is just 0.01 seconds behind the British record of women in the 200 m swimming final.
"Everyone has a second chance," Jephimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping's past, defended her right to start in Rio.
In 2013, she was banned from 16 months after her body found traces of anabolic steroids.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be denied participation in Rio because they have been sanctioned in advance.
CAS reviewed my complaint, and I won.
If someone likes it and someone else has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Every person must be given a second chance.
When you go and give you a penalty check, no one puts you in prison.
Ben Plāds wins a place for 50 free-style swimming
In the past, he set up a British record to win a place in a 50-metre free-style swimming final.
Union champion Praud (21) sailed the distance in 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth fastest to qualify for the Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rough
The Indian sports minister, Vija Goel Rio, has been a rather prominent figure in the Olympics, often seen in the tribunals, encouraging Indian athletes and receiving selfies after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have apparently provoked the organisers of the Olympic Games because of their uncontrollable behaviour, repeatedly trying to break up to the competition zones without proper accreditation and in response, being tested, reports the press Trust of India news agency.
Wyy Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behavior did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted areas of the gymnastics competition and arena, where the waking and tecvando take place.
"We have received several reports that your Sport Minister has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited persons," says Sarah Peterson, continental manager of Rio 2016's Committee of Organisers.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people together with the minister became aggressive and rude and sometimes broke by our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any other cases of such behaviour, the accreditation of your sports minister will be revoked and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be revoked," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this thing "an elephant blew from the fly", and Goel himself said that he did not do anything wrong by writing it down as "misunderstood".
On Twitter, he wrote: "As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, these Olympic Games are quite grim to India, and there is no medal yet.
The lost fans in social media pointed out that Michael Pellps has won as many medals as India in its history - 26.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he stayed fourth.
Wind run money and opportunity," the author and column author of the Sardine Twist article, Shoba De.
However, there are still some bright hopes, because there will still be competition in boxing, golfing, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast, Dip Karmakara, will compete in the jump finals on Sunday, showing his terrible double speed "Death Jump", Produnov's jump, which has been tried by only a few other gymnastics.
In a country of 1.25 billion people, India’s low number of medals won has always been a source of indignation.
Analysts say that there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for the Olympics - Carmacar's first gymnastics tool was made from the spare parts of an old sculptor.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its statute in 2012, as it elected the leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been brought.
In Sochi, three participants in the Indian Winter Olympic Games were even denied the right to represent their country, to carry a flag or to wear anything with national symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people get injuries, the JetBlue plane that is shaken by terrorism on the Boston-Sacramento route is forced to land in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the turbulent period, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 at local time.
The airline says that the wounded have been taken to the hospital for checks.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the wounded, that a backup plane has arrived in Rapidsitija to transport the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug control agency (DEA) misses the chance for medical marijuana
The answer is unfortunately: unlikely.
This is a lost opportunity, which can further hinder treatment provision for countless people.
To date, there is only one federally approved source of medical marijuana for scientific purposes at the University of Mississippi.
In seemingly more positive news today, the DEA has also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the amounts and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis in favour of the study, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available if access to it is still difficult, it has little meaning.
Imagine a product that is very much in demand but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to the demand for goods, someone makes a hard to understand decision to produce it more, but to get it never shuts the door.
This product is marijuana and its presence on list 1 is this locked door.
Such an unpleasant situation is medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a listed substance on List 1 (respectively, it is defined as "not currently authorised for medical use and there is a high potential for use for unforeseen purposes"), there are significant obstacles to the removal of doors.
Potential researchers usually turn to DEA first because it allows them to launch scientific research.
Even if the substances on List 1 are authorised, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up high-level safety systems which may be costly.
There is also a more subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic institution to carry out research on substances included in Schedule 1 first.
Even if some representatives of the faculty want to carry out this study, university management may not want problems or some potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Suu Sisley was released after an effort to advance medical marijuana trials.
After all, Sisly had to seek private funding for her project, and it was only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, that her project became the first medical marijuana trial approved by DEA to prevent post-traumatic stress for the Veterans.
Then, after years of fighting the bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute for Drug Addiction has been at the last lock.
At the moment, it is the largest federal public funding for the study of marijuana and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical medicine is released into free circulation for research, the Institute will still have to approve all its funded research.
The problem, however, is the name of abuse.
The representative of the San Francisco University Dr. Donald Eibram, interviewed for his documentary "Marijuana", says that the Institute's main task is to study substances in the context of their potential addictions, not as medicines.
Eybram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it causes.
Note: In a rapid (and, admittedly, non-scientific) search at the U.S. National Medical Library, 1,434 works on medical marijuana were found in the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies concerned damage caused by marijuana, such as "A bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Prancreatitis caused by marijuana" and "Use of marijuana and lung cancer risk".
This disproportionality creates a completely distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view is.
While DEA takes on list 1 status without considering the medical effect, the US Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains the cannabinoid patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to establish marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with high dependence potential, even though the chief administrative judge of DEA, Frensis Yang, objected to it.
In medical terms, marijuana is safer than many foods that are widely consumed.
For example, bypassing 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so much marijuana that death occurs.
Marijuana is one of the safest therapeutic agents known to mankind in its natural form.
By rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used in medical treatment under appropriate supervision.
Once again, it was proposed by the judge of the DEA itself.
But almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of this or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Perhaps we do not always have the energy to express it loudly, or we are so mute or stunned that no one seems to have noticed it.
As far as hypocrisy in the context of federal medical marijuana policy is concerned, there must be endurance in presenting facts.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by medical marijuana, and the lives of many others depend on it.
It is worth talking at a higher level about the fact that the plant can provide so much benefit and still remain behind closed doors.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Tramps "Blondais Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots are known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say that Trump dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and I'm looking like a blonde Berlusconi," said CNN, founder of the electronic music punk association The Bloody Beetroots.
The candidate for the office of President of the Republic and the Italian media magnet that has become a politician, both known for their exaggerated personalities, their ability to attract press attention and the transformed story in the media.
In the composition of "Bloody Beetroots", Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, from legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electropop singer Gret Swab Beche in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love".
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincides with the time of the punk, and the figures "1977" are set by the musician on his breasts.
"The English language is not my mother tongue, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black charge with which he is known.
I am trying to explore and have tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch Videocracy, a documentary that explores the Berlusconi monopoly on Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trump had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and bend everything... his own," he said.
I think the Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors in prison for over £500 million in drug law
Two Turkish men were sentenced to over GBP 500 million for smuggling cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea, each for at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of a trial in the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from Aberdeen's coasts on the MV Hamal deck, three tons of Class A drugs were found.
Detention in 2015 is the largest single-step seized cocaine cargo ever seized at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sachin and Emin Ozman were sentenced to prison for their role in a large-scale drug transaction.
One of the largest in British history is the drug cargo found on board.
The drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped hide on a tugboat registered in Tanzania, sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet's frigate "HMS Somerset" and the "HMC Valant" border force.
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, and Ozman (51) is sentenced to 20 years in Glasgow Supreme Court.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven told men that the quantity of drugs was "not only significant but ambitious", and drug trafficking has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said, "You were involved in the most commercially ambitious operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the captain of the ship Sahin was not "at the top of the drug tree", but he played a key role in the crime, while the second captain, Ozman, played a role "to some extent less".
The inspectors boarded Hamal, following encouraging information from the French customs office DNSED, and when it boarded in Aberdeen, they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment where 128 packages of 3,2 tonnes of cocaine were found, with an estimated value on the black market of GBP 512 million.
MV Hamal was tested last year by the Royal Navy.
Three tons of cocaine were on board.
Examination of the ship revealed that its ballast tanks contain tonnes of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this area was opened under the closet in one of the crew's premises and the gap was blocked.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board between 20 February and 23 April last year, and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two unpunished men who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school continue to claim that they are not guilty, but nevertheless make a sworn sentence.
There is no evidence of any accusations against four more men.
Sachin's lawyer Jonathan Crowe said that the married father of two children is a "glorified mule".
He said, "Anybody involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who can drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sachin is certainly not at the top of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board meant that it had to be removed by a crane
The police went through the entire ship for days before the drugs were broken down into these boxes
Sahina asked questions about his master's work to Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krov said that he was "shocked" about missing the events of an important daughter (9) and son (13) and "just wanting to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since they were arrested in April 2015, as families are still fighting to obtain a visa endorsement.
Ozman's lawyer Di Murce said that he "despitely" wants to see his family, but knows that in the transparent future it will "not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: "There are no borders for international drug trafficking, and we, whose task is to destroy it, work more closely together to make us one step ahead.
"Scotland's success in the prosecution of criminals is indeed global, and in this case we have caused considerable economic damage to the representatives of organised crime."
The drugs were placed in all gaps on the ship, including under the floor.
Inspectors of these smuggling packages found hidden in the ship’s washing room
Mr Harvey added: 'Hamal' was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities, and by rapid cooperation with the Prosecutor General of Tanzania, where the ship was registered, who also allowed boarding.
"Our investigation then went from Guiana, which provided access to relevant data on shipments to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information about the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the USA to put together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the extensive intelligence that Hamal is carrying large quantities of drugs, the British authorities could not climb international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government - something that they had never granted before.
Suju Peiten, Head of the Office of the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CPS), International Court and the fight against organised crime, said: "As soon and precisely as possible, the CPS criminal justice adviser managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to climb on board within 24 hours of receiving intelligence.
Under international maritime law, British officials do not have the right to climb international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State unless that State grants special legal permission to do so.
Without the immediate action of our criminal justice adviser, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never bring these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn embodies the lost "East Express" train
Photographer Brian Romeijn of Rotterdam has taken pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
Figures show the inside of the train raging, broken seats, dust windows and a narrow driver's cab
It has already been named Eastern Express wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian National Railway Company
The urban explorer has taken these remarkable photographs, which show the lost remnants of a passenger train that once was one of the best ways to travel.
Its flower days have long passed, and the train wagon and the locomotives have been left to blow up in the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular destination for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these horrific photographs showing the inside of the train, the broken seats, the windows covered with dust and the compressed driver’s cab
The train wagon and the locomotives have been left to blow up in the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular sightseeing of photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name between 1883 and 2009.
The locomotives were used by the Belgian national railway company some 50 years ago.
After 126 years, the last train running under the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous history.
The Eastern Express was famous for the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as the French word "Express d'Orient".
It became the Eastern Express in 1891 and had regular routes throughout Europe until 1930.
It should not be confused with private "Venice Simplen-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury wagons left.
In this photograph, the narrow driver’s cab, where the equipment in the rust, is still equipped with measuring instruments and open wires.
Romeijn said that the driver's cab is "in a way claustrophobic, and the locomotives' noise is probably unbearable."
The abandoned locomotives and wagons have become a popular sightseeing object for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeindge MailOnlineTravel said: "I really could feel how it was used in its flower times."
Well-off gentlemen in high hats join in ladies' beautiful dresses on their way.

Lankashir's father is expelled from children's school for a T-shirt with llamas word
The father of two children has been expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day on a T-shirt with offensive inscription.
K. Macbett (36) from the town of Lankashir says that he "randomly" wearing a shirt with the inscription "Lying and Dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his seed and put on the T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that he was prohibited from entering the school territory.
The single father, who has served for four years as the head of the Park Primary School in Kolne, Child, was unable to come after the children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and the police.
The children from the children say that he has not been admitted to school after having arrived on the children's sports day in an offending T-shirt.
Mr. Childly charges the school director, Sarah Migley, for over-reaction.
He says that he has been unduly punished for the fact that before you go watch your two children's race, wrong hastily wearing a T-shirt.
A father who no longer works as head of school said, "It was a mistake and neglect on my part."
I don't think about sports day, and I rushed when I put it on.
At the end of the event we had a father race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologize and cut it to the other side, and the case ended.
However, the 36-year-old man said that he had received a letter from the head of schools that evening inviting him to a meeting with the director the following day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the school director called me and told me that I was not allowed to enter the school territory," Mr. Childly added.
I learned that after the day of sports, some parents had been alarmed about it on Facebook and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable person would say that it is exaggeration.
Mr Macbeta, who is the editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he thought he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this led to a call from school and social services.
On T-shirt was Creig Charles' image Lister from the BBC cult comedy "Red Throat" with one of his iconic expressions "Lying and Dr.am."
He commented: "I told them I wasn't there because I'm not allowed to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I was not after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer come to the school premises and that the ban would remain in force until further statements.
He also said that he had been warned that he could be fined GBP 500 if caught in breach of this rule.
Sarah Mijley, director of the Park Primary School, said that the case had now been brought to an end.
Sarah Mijley, director of the Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Macbeta has resigned and is no longer our head of school."
This case is now over, and I hope to return to the regular school life in September."
Joe Kooney, a city adviser to the child, said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We must all bear in mind that taking on such positions as counselor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately, this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
The counsellor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have imposed a ban on him and that an elephant would have been blown out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wear of this T-shirt was stupid, and he also apologized for it."
The Lanashire police confirmed that they were called from school, but they did not come.
Recently, the premises of the former factory VEF located on the Brīvības Street have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the industry has already started to call this territory the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Berzaune, is also developing.
The project development and construction of the 2nd stage of the LU Academic Centre in Torņkalns will cost 21 million euros.
The procurement announced by the University of Latvia on the development, construction and author supervision of the 2nd stage technical project of the Academic Centre in Torņakalns, Riga, is confirmed by a statement on the website of the Procurement Monitoring Bureau.
Procurement is organised in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The agreement will be concluded with the full company LNK Industries Group, which is committed to performing these works for 21 186 560 euro.
As explained by LU, the University continues the design, author supervision and construction of the next round of the Academic complex - the building of the Science Centre, according to the project of Skiču and the specified construction year, when starting planning and implementation of the projects of the European Union Foundation for the 2014-2021 planning period.
The building of the Science Centre is similar to the one designed and built in the 1st stage and to the activities carried out in it, which are similar in terms of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The competition was accompanied by the 6th style sketch project developed by SIA, which provided all possible suppliers with information about the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalns, including a list of objects planned by the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia, indicating the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of commissioning of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015 the sixth style of SIA carried out meta-adjustments to the territory of the building complex of the previously developed University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņakalns, which resulted in clarification of the location of the Academic Centre buildings and their interconnection, as well as transport organisation throwing them into the territory and its surroundings.
A tender is launched for grass cutting in the lanes of road compartments.
The SJSC Latvian road maintenance has announced a procurement for mechanised grass cutting in the lanes of the road partitions in the regions of Latvia and in Pierīga, informs LAU.
The object of the procurement is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rezekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga road districts.
Applicants may submit a tender for one or more lots.
The mowing of grass in the lanes of road compartments is necessary to improve the transparency of the roads and the surrounding areas for drivers, to facilitate the farewell of the road, and to limit the incision of the grass and the formation of a bundle.
The most ambitious lawn-cutting works for farmers are planned for the total of 28 roads in the Talsi road area of 637 kilometres of hiking, for 20 roads in the Valmiera road area of 432 kilometres of hiking, and for 17 roads in Alūksne of 384 kilometres of hiking.
It has already been reported that in June the company completed the grass cutting work on the main and most important regional asphalted roads of the country, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads the SJSC Latvian road maintenance planned to entrust some of the cutting work to farmers.
"It is an opportunity for us to use the funds allocated for road maintenance more effectively, while at the same time enabling farmers to fully load the machinery and earn," says Vladimirs Kononovs, Chairman of the Board of the SJSC Latvian Road Maintenance Agency.
The time limit for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Ombudsman: Demagogy on a compulsory health insurance model with additional financial burdens does not pass any criticism to citizens.
Any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high payment burden on citizens, does not withstand any criticism, is considered by the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Jansons met today with Health Minister Anda Chakš to discuss the health situation.
After the meeting Jansons told journalists that the industry financing model proposed by the Minister of Health is sustainable and would develop the healthcare system, making it more accessible to patients.
He pointed out, however, that additional funding for healthcare should be mentioned here, as it is currently insufficient.
Jansons also stressed that any demagoguery on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high payment burden on citizens, does not withstand any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is called upon.
Jansons said that the Netherlands devotes 11% of gross domestic product to health, while Latvia - only 3%.
So the government and the parliament must be sufficiently responsible to understand that this freezing point must rise, said the Ombudsman and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should have access to a doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out that with an additional EUR 35 million planned next year it will be possible to do only the most acute cases regarding oncological patients and the remuneration of maternity specialists.
As a result, the VM has drawn up a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million in healthcare to reduce the number of teams and investigations.
"The question of priorities, whether it has funds or not," said Chakša.
This amount does not, however, include an increase in salary for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that medical practitioners are not delighted that all three options of the model of healthcare financing are being promoted by the VM for government consideration, including those providing for additional payment to patients, Čakša said that by moving all three models, the government is given the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that it is possible to clearly show that Latvia is not prepared to impose additional burdens on the population by moving all three models.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the variant of the model of financing of health care, which does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, however, requires some of the social tax to be shifted to health, says the summary of the conceptual report "On changing the model of financing of the Latvian health care system".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best option for the model of health financing would be chosen as a result of the discussions by the end of September.
Local watermelons are ready.
The watermelon this year, says Rolands Dambis, the owner of Arjus in Grobiņa Municipality Medzes.
Watermelons are already available on the Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have started production, but the later tubers are well removed, reports the regional newspaper Course Time.
"This year watermelons grow better than last year", says the grower of big berries in Rucava district Artis Kuusis.
In terms of weather, this is also a much more favorable summer than in the past, when it was cold and windy.
Guest performances of Liepaja Theatre begin in Riga.
On 12 and 13 August, Liepaja Theatre will visit Daile Theatre in Riga, offering performances nominated for the "Playman Night" award, as well as a bright intrigue – the single performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herberts Laukštīne, and the portal "Delfi" is informed by the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, the audience will be shown the human drama "Ion Man" by the director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is a story about a real historical person - John Merrick - who lived in London of the Victorian age and in his own cropland, because of the deformed body of the inherited disease was called the Solomon Man.
The title role of the institution is represented by actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the nomination "Actor of the Year" for the role of Merika.
As his performance has been described by critic Normunds Akotts, Meriks is a "missing heart" role where the image born cannot be repeated.
On 13 August, the exhibition "Portrait" will be offered to the audience.
The performance received six nominations of "Gamemans Night", including "The Big Show of the Year".
The director has created the production as a unique gallery of portraits, giving equal importance to every image of the plays, so each of them has both a center and a background.
The performance consists of several mini performances, which end in a single whole.
It is an observation about human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and a cold calculation, strikingly revealing how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf who, because of his greed and his own good, breaks down the surrounding sheep, sometimes one of the other.
On both these dates, a monoplay "Man who avoids the elevator" by Galina Poliščuka will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja Theatre Herberts Laukštein.
It's not sad, but it's a humorous story about how a elevator becomes the only friend of someone.
Despite the style of the cemetery, which dominates the visual image of the performances, the dominant intonation of the production is, however, bright and even optimistic.
"Man who avoids the elevator" is not about the decision of loneliness and age, but about the fact that life is worth loving.
Even if it seems that there is nothing about it", critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the performance.
Tickets to all productions can be purchased at the "Biļešu paradīze" box offices and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: my work is not a series, but a real life.
Olga Zelika, the owner and investigator of Riga Detective Agency, is welcome to me halfway through.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression on the person.
Dressed in white panties and white jacket - a very elegant woman who overturns all my ideas about what a woman detective should be.
She's waiting for me with a champagne, which I'm kindly refusing.
I told her that I was addressing her because I thought it was interesting that a woman was doing something so unusual.
It has always been men's work.
Olga has higher legal education - Master's degree.
He used to work in the criminal police.
He realized that he wanted something of his own and founded his own company.
That's enough knowledge.
"I really didn't want to go back to Poland," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated cases, we collected information.
We're working with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of Riga Detective Agency."
She calls for the anniversary celebrations: "There will be no drinking."
All are promising people.
When asked about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that working in a team is sometimes dangerous.
It is such a business when, if someone does not work professionally, one can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.
Of course, the sphere is not easy.
Many try to throw us in because we are engaged in a marriage fraud.
That's what people think!
Many come and require, or can place listening equipment, attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's the collection of information," Olga tells.
If there's a law crime, I have to warn you about it.
We put on green tea and laugh at least to have a cup to hold on to and cause negotiations.
I've had a client whose husband was constantly hit.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a manic.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the worst thing," Olga says.
The psycho is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a animal.
It can end up bad.
Don't give God with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People are becoming victims at some point.
"Many women try to leave their families and then come back again," she says.
I refused the last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," reveals Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
"His husband beat his son and made her disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct, and first of all, she must protect her children.
When it all happened, she came to me with a request to get rid of that man.
There are people who are possessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that Mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We could not find a body, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't do anything without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a healthy psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or there is a divorce in the family and information needs to be collected.
The question is who is the guilty party.
The last thing I've had is when the friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting, because sometime the men are snooping, now the women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women throw their friends for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and over-trusted," Olga believes.
There have been times when couples go abroad to marry for a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a man like Jesus Christ.
Long hair, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned like a completely different person.
"I pulled him out," Olga remembers.
It's like hell, it was terrible.
Asked what is the most unusual thing you have to face, Olga says: "Everything is special, but it's the most bad thing that uses trust."
When a friend throws a friend.
Borrow and don't give back money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel detective, another to be," Olga tells.
The situations in which we deal with mistrust are quite crazy, because women are often not ready to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation, for a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who taste money use rich married men.
One man who followed his wife said that she could not be loved because all the wives had cheated on her.
"He was married three times," Olga remembers.
So I guess there's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on him.
Olga tells of a woman who left a man with all her children and asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
In general, I constantly beat him, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to the spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How does this happen?
"In parallel to detective work, there is protection of personal data," Olga tells.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other does not allow anything.
For our personal interests, we are allowed to take such photos and videos, but no public view.
If a court presents a material that is incompatible with the law, then there may be major problems.
In order to become a detective, education and experience are not enough, it is also necessary to be mentally sound and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, the police do it.
I say to my clients - disconnect from the series, here is real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, I had to use dogs too, they were very helpful.
"The drug department can't do without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in connection with the murder investigation, but I do not like to take such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more customers of men, because women tend to ridicule about men.
It was different once.
Now women have fun, but men sit at home with their children.
"Of course, it's the people who suffer the most," Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start real life.
We all know that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that's unpleasant.
That must not be the case.
You must not be afraid to lose what hinders life!
You can't become a small-histor, and what happens to us is what we allow ourselves to do.
Yes, my first thing was directly related to my husband's distrust when she was not prepared to accept the fact that her husband cheated on her.
She called all the time and asked her what to do.
"I'm now asking all clients if they're ready to accept the situation when they find out that a man really cheats on him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire detectives, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but real life.
I'm also a specialist.
It is a heart thing and associated with Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why have I started doing this?
It is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to calm down.
Reiki not only calms, but restores energy, light.
"People leave my office positively and satisfiedly," Olga says.
She has signs on her wall at the office, and Olga says that they write, not with the help of the brush, but with the fingers.
I didn't just get in until then, the book I needed literally fell into my hands.
I felt it like a sign.
However, it is very personal.
Find out more about it here.
Olga's singing too.
It's her hobbies.
We are all driven by creativity.
I played guitar from 11 years of age.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smile, but I have to rest to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol's sinking.
The police use it a lot because the work is stressful.
"This causes aggression, and the moves can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sport and I need it.
I spent 15 years in tennis.
I also liked riding horses.
I'm out of nature, write articles, I'd like to write a book.
Detective work has a fine boundary when work enters your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be allowed into life," she says.
Asked how you can combine work with private life, Olga says, "My beloved is in Italy."
We have a very strong feeling.
It must be the truest love in my life.
I've got enough to think about him, and I'm feeling better.
The detectives usually do not trust, but he has accepted my work.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I'm not even in this business.
I've been directed by Reiki.
When I was a child, I saw more than anyone else.
Thanks to the needs, the intuition opens.
There are many detectives, but there are few real workers.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is hard to disconnect.
You also need rest.
"Other than you can't get back," Olga admits.
The most difficult case I've worked with is the story of Constance.
I've been working on that thing for a year.
The man literally laughed at that woman.
I did so that the child and his mom left for England, far away from danger.
There were no other options.
We must not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to be happy about every day that we have.
We have to thank God.
Three good things have to be said every day to someone else.
You have to do a good job or make a day for yourself.
We shouldn't be raising men like that.
It's a big mistake.
We must understand that we have a man, not a child, next to us, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not okay, you have to turn around and get out.
You can go to church, it's been a great help to me.
Don't be a fanatic, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change unless it changes, you have to leave and you have to change your life.
Under no circumstances should you put yourself and your children at risk.
Don't sit down and wait for something.
People are created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we need and are not in vain in this world.
You can never sit on the ground!
How to better prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the next school year that families are able to capture in the memory immediately.
To make the photos look happy and beautiful, it is worth thinking about how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
The advice "Ihappymama" is given by many children's mom Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to take pictures in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
The study makes it more difficult for children to get involved and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in one color gamma.
For example, Alexandra says that she chooses clothing for all six members of her family so that no more than three colors and as little as possible inscriptions on the clothing.
Don't forget about a good mood.
Have fun, have fun, have fun, have fun, play, but never banish or psycho if children are not at once as obedient as they would like.
And here's the advice from the professional photographer's box!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some they will be beautiful, children and an ideal family picture, for others - "life is what it is", i.e., the desire to see true, true emotions in pictures, or how to say the photographer himself in love - "vulnerable backs", "open eyes", "unlocked noses".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that it's just a couple hours from your life, and the less you're gonna be stuck in, the better.
You're yourself, there's no strong mom who works, cooks, brings up and so on, and not the dad who's always talking on the phone.
And not the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to embrace one another, smile at your own people, and have fun.
And then the photographer's task will be just to capture the true moments of emotions that prevail among you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show what has happened, to listen to his advice in choosing clothes, to better shots.
Fold and clean up all the clothes you need in advance so that you don't have to do it on the day of the photo session.
Plan the route and think about how long you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially if photography takes place in a studio and time is limited).
If you have small children, then choose for the photo session the time that corresponds to the day-to-day period of the birth, so that it doesn't happen when your baby normally sleeps the day.
And, of course, don't forget to take food, cookies, water and the favorite toy with your children (use the candy and sweets only in extreme situations).
Prepare your dad that he may need to wear his socks, but it is not usually written in such tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, says Marina.
Do not drink much water before the photo shoot and lie down well before it is taken.
And it would also be advisable to have some entertainment together after the photo session.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, have fun with skateboards - which the family likes more.
In this way you will at the same time get great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: Lifting a minimum wage - a miracle stick or brake for the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public debate is almost the status of a sacred cow: either to support raising or to mention some unspeakable, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (as soon as we avoided the technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, will bring Latvia's wages closer to the Western European level and will fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than good because raising it reduces companies' competitiveness and employment, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
At the first moment, it seems that despite several minimum wage increases during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising the usual few dozens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture can be found if we compare it with the average wage in the country (%) – the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the share of the minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (in Latvia - 17%, in Lithuania - 11%, in Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar increase in the minimum wage is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the Bank of Latvia survey, each fifth Latvian company replied that increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of products.
This means, firstly, that the rise in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness both on the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports were encouraged).
Due to weaker competitiveness and stagnant production volumes, it was important for almost every fifteen Latvian companies to lay off employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
Moreover, almost one in eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if each fifth company noted an important improvement in productivity when assessing the 2014 minimum wage, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the fourth increase in the minimum wage could in turn outweigh the potential for productivity gains).
Another important result is that, due to the rise in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees earning more than minimum wages.
Thus, the effect of the minimum wage was significant even for companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States has exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in the minimum wage, which is not justified by the increase in labour productivity (even though the overall level of the euro is rather low), will have a negative impact on companies' competitiveness and employment.
When assessing the validity of raising the minimum wage, it is not enough to analyse the economic averages alone.
It is also necessary to assess whether raising the minimum wage is "responsible" in the sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
Results of the Bank of Latvia survey show that the largest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher in the industrial and service sectors (16% and 19% respectively) than in the commercial sectors (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further increase may be detrimental rather by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs show that the massive increase in minimum wage implemented in 2014-2015 (by 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there are no regions in Estonia and Lithuania that would be so far behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Tauragė region, but there was also a minimum wage of 54% of the average wage in 2015 (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage in 2016, this figure could reach 58%.
In the public debate, there is a lack of economic justification for raising the minimum wage from time to time up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here), and this cannot be achieved either in the short or the long term.
Firstly, there is no EU country with such a high figure from or even close to the average wage.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in a number of economic sectors (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering, and veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in Latgale private sector.
The raising of the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently proposed by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4%, but minimum wages at least twice as fast, this clearly has negative consequences for companies' competitiveness and employment.
Such negative effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example in Latgale.
The fact that we cannot afford a significant increase in the minimum wage at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used to support low-wage earners.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with a minimum exempt from personal income tax (as far as budget options are concerned).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education acquired, as well as poor health status (often due to the cost of medical treatment and long queues) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey 521 responses from Latvian company were received regarding the response to the increase in the minimum wage in January 2014.
The survey was conducted within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a workforce of at least 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.
On the last day, 11 fires were registered in Latvia, and operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD) shows.
The largest fires in Latvia were located in Ogre municipality of Ogrogals, where a single-storey non-managed residential house was lit in the area of 80 square meters and in the area of 30 square meters in Jēkabpils Street, where an open flame was burned.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls where waste, tires, two cars, building walls and ceilings, sheds, home roofs, and unsupervised lit food.
The service also took part in 21 rescue work during the night.
No fatalities, victims or rescues shall be reported.
A total of 38 calls were answered by the VUG during the past 24 hours, of which six were misleading.

The Russian Vice Prime Minister meets the ZZS ministers secretly in Riga.
The Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev Arkadijs Dvorkovics met with three ZZS politicians at the fish processing plant "Kaja" last week - Finance Minister Dana Reiznieki-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, and the portal "sikies.lv".
According to the portal, none of the parties have informed about such a meeting, but the fact about the meeting has been confirmed by Reizniece-Ozola, the responsibility for organising the secret conversations should be transferred to Dūklava.
The Minister explained that the organizer was Ambassador of Russia Alexander Veshniakov.
The Minister of Finance has discovered that negotiations have been on the possibility of abolishing sanctions for fish processors, as well as whether Russia will continue to "pump" gas in Inčukalns gas storage.
Dvorkovics explained that this is not a government issue, but an energy company issue.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Foreign Ministry has not been involved in the conversation.
Dūklāvs has justified this, that he has not seen such a need, because "the Minister of Foreign Affairs is on vacation," writes the portal.

The legendary editor Huffington leaves The Huffington Post.
Arianna Haffington, co-founder and chief editor of the powerful US media holding The Huffington Post, announced his departure from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicer Prize, offers both serious political and economic journalism and entertainment coverage of Internet sensations, is considered as a source of media development at a time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
Media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time in circumstances where there was no Twitter yet, but the feisbuck gained popularity only among students in state colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of George Bush, a representative of the Republican Party, Haffington, the U.S. President, he did not conceal that media journalists were representing liberal values, and that world view would also produce news material.
Now Haffington on Twitter discovers that after leaving, she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a "Thrive Global" startup to address employees' health and congestion issues.
It is not yet known who could take her place under The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal gave up anonymous comments, emphasising to Haffington that freedom of expression is given to people who stand up for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
She also decided to publish news about US presidential candidate Donald Trump in the entertainment news section in summer 2015.
However, at the end of 2015, pointing out that trampa's rhetoric is dangerous for US society, the details of the odiotic candidate were published again in the policy section.
It was reported that in 2011 the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news website The Huffington Post, which was visited by almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction was worth $ 315 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant Verizon purchased AOL for US$4.4 billion.
In 2016, Verizon also bought Yahoo's online business parts.
With these transactions, The Huffington Post, once a powerful and independent medium, became a small particle from a giant corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, their total unique number of visits every month is estimated at 81 million.

The police rescue the baby from overheating in the car; the parents are threatened with judicial action.
In Riga, the municipal police rescued the baby from a hot car yesterday, while the child's parents threatened the police with judicial works about the lost glass of the car, LETA informed Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, an agitated man ran to the patrol, who told us that he noticed a car in a parking lot at Spice shopping center, where a baby was present for half an hour without adults.
On arrival, a car named by an eyewitness was found and was parked in the sun.
The front passenger seat contained the infant seat.
On the child was shined directly by the sun.
The infant shouted loudly, breathing intensely, and his face was reddened and flushed.
In view of the fact that the vehicle owner was not present on site, it is immediately decided to pull out the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the entire seat is taken out of the hot vehicle, and a medical doctor is called.
The child breathed shallow, the skin was red and hot, so until medical officers arrived, orderkeepers put a cool compress on the forehead.
Doctors and parents of the child came to the scene almost at the same time.
When the baby’s father saw the broken window on his vehicle, he remained aggressive and did not let the doctor come.
Discussions with parents have been carried out and it has been explained that a child under the age of seven is prohibited from being left alone.
In addition, the child was left in life - threatening conditions.
After discussions, the victims were examined and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the child’s parents strongly refused to give any explanations about what had happened and threatened with judicial work on the car’s disintegrating glass.
During the discussions with the parents, there was no evidence that they were under the influence of alcohol or could otherwise harm the child.
The case materials were sent to the Children's Offence Prevention Department, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
The RPP reminds us that even if the outside is not very hot, the sun - left car heats very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, this may be a threat to their lives.
The members of the LPF could request the withdrawal of Mr.
The members of the Latvian Bathing Federation (LPF) could in the near future request the removal of its current head, Kaspars Ponis, from the office of the President of the Federation, LETA was told by the former Vice-President of the Federation Jānis Dzenis.
He said that, in view of the criticism expressed in recent days about Mr. and his activities in the Federation, several members of the LPF have signed a letter asking for the LPF general meeting, which is the highest institution in the Federation, and that it is entitled to decide on any issue raised by the LPF general meeting.
The members of the Federation are dissatisfied with Mr. Command's style, and his trip to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, to which, in turn, it was not possible to go to the Latvian record in the Olympics by the swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Jakubovskis, was evaluated as unethical and unworthy action of the President.
Dzenis pointed out that members of the LPF, as well as the Secretary General of the Federation Aivars Platonov, have done a lot of work on the development of the federation and sports, but Mr.
A person who worked for a long time in the Federation explained that there was a visible attempt in the Federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Therefore, the members of the federation could also request that the statutes governing the operation of the LPF be amended, which would exclude this possibility in the future.
Dzenis explained that the dissatisfaction with Mr.'s work in the federation had existed for a long time, but events of the last days had served as members of the "last castle" federation to decide that action should be taken.
Former Vice-President of the Federation said that the work of the Council for Trainers and Judges was greatly reduced during the years of Mr.
He explained that, in order to ensure a faster process and decision-making in the Federation, members of the LPF had decided at a general meeting to authorise the Board, composed of Sir and two Vice-Presidents, to lead the Federation.
However, Mr. Dzenny admitted that he failed the members of the federation.
The members of the Federation trusted the Lord, believing that this would enable the Federation to make decisions more quickly.
"He let the confidence of his members down, because he practically took power in his hands, making an unethical step," said Dzenis.
"Such attitude cannot come from a person who should serve as an example for other sports representatives," Dzenis admitted.
In Dzin's opinion, Mr. President has tried to fulfil his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as President of the LPF.
The long-term Secretary-General of the LPF, Vladimir Maslovskis, told the agency LETA that a letter could be submitted to the federation next week, so that the LPF general meeting would have to meet within a month.
In his opinion, the general meeting should "talk all the painful issues" and decide on the next steps.
Mr President, it was not yet known on Friday that the members of the LPF were planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his resignation.
So I don’t know anything about having such a meeting, so I don’t have any comments.
As regards the fact that the members are dissatisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the already mentioned coach Jakubowski, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case Yakubovskis lost the position of senior coach of the team because his actions were not in line with LPF's interests," Mr.
He also stressed that he had not yet received the accusations at the LPF Members’ General Meetings, which reported on the progress made.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," the President of LPF said.
He also explained that he had not gone to Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics, but to work.
For more people in Latvia it is not clear and they do not understand what functions the presidents of federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these positions, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sports federation has enough funding, because only 10% of the national LPF receives the necessary funding.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the International Federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"I have also entered into negotiations and worked to see one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," Mr.
According to the data of the portal "Firmas.lv", in 2015 LPF revenues totalled 249 444 euros, which is less than 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up of targeted grants received last year, the amount of which increased by around €10 000 compared to 2014.
In the form of members, membership and other annual contributions, LPF also received about 43% of revenue, or 109 442 euros.
In the form of donations and donations, the Federation received a further 35 532 euros last year.
Last year, the Federation's spending increased by about 70 000 euros compared to 2014, with a total of 263 876 euros spent in 2015.
The biggest expenditure was not related to cash payments to persons, material expenses or salaries - EUR 215 733 was reported as "other expenditure".
Cash payments to persons have been spent EUR 20 549, while salaries have been paid EUR 14 684.
If the Federation had concluded 2014 with a positive balance, then in 2015 the LPF concluded with a negative balance.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science has requested clarification from the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about the participation of the President of the LPF in the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, which, in turn, has not been visited by the Latvian swimmer Ribakova coach Jakubovskis.
Latvian nationals have not been hit by the explosions that took place in Thailand, as shown by the entry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the social site Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that according to the information held by the Honorary Consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian nationals had not been victims of the explosions.
LETA has already announced that the JAS invites travellers to keep track of information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the location, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
The Latvian UMA invites to avoid gathering places, to be particularly careful and attentive when staying in public places, and to follow instructions from local authorities.
Travellers located in Thai resorts or planning to go there, the Ministry invites you to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will take place according to the plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to keep track of information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the fragile security situation in the country, the JAS is not recommended to travel to the Thai and Cambodian border, as well as to the provinces of the Thai and Malaysian border - Patan, Yala, Narathiva and Sonkhla.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department's daily on-call call +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad buy a life and health insurance policy, including repatriation in case of sickness or death, and register in the Consular Register before travelling.
However, they will not leave Argentina's football selection.
The superstar of football Lionel Messi, however, decided to return to Argentina after a short period of reflection, and the player himself announced on Friday.
In July, Argentina’s selection for the second year in a row failed in the Copa America finals, re-appreciating Chile’s superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after his loss, the Messiah announced that he would end his career in the government, but then he was reported to be back in the sample.
"I seriously considered leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and selection is too great," said the 29-year-old Messiah.
The Spanish Grand Barcelona attacker on the Messi government lines has won 55 gates in 112 games, which is the best indicator ever.
Together with the adult selection, Messi has not been a great success, even though Argentina became the world's vice-champion as early as 2014.
The fair is called the world's best footballer five times.
For Chinese Dzins and Iron double victory in the Rio 20 km walking distance.
On Friday, Chinese soloists Van Dzen and Cai Dzelin won a double victory in Rio de Janeiro in the 20 km walk of the Olympic Games.
The Olympic champion was crowned by Dzen, who took the distance within an hour in 19 minutes and four seconds, overtaking the Iron in the finish for 12 seconds.
The bronze was won by the Australian soloist Dain Burd-Smit, who lost 23 seconds to Dzen.
The householder’s favorite Kai Bonfim corrected Brazil’s record, but he missed five seconds to climb to the honorary pedestal.
He won a bronze award in London four years ago.
He's also at the same distance two silver medals in world championships.
Judo's coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not the right weight.
Oleg Baskin, a Latvian youth coach, admitted in good faith that Arthur Nikiforenko Rio at the Olympics had almost no chance of overcoming the much-heavy Azerbaijani athletes Ušangi Kukauri.
Practically, there was no chance, only minimal if he had been caught by a method or a parter.
We had already anticipated that this would be the case.
When he was ready, he was right to fight, but the adversary was stronger.
The opponent had been well - known, since Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arthur is artificially accused of the heaviest weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already busy, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthur, weighing 100 pounds [100 kg], struggled against a juteist who has already won several serious tournaments.
In the heavy weight category, there are very few random moments.
If all kinds of turns occur in light weight categories, then the heavy ones are very rare.
To the question of whether Nikiforenko would be better to fight one degree in the lighter weight category in the future, Baskin replied in a positive way.
I think it would be better for Arthur to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
This is his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two out of three Venezuelans want to leave President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that "there is no time" for the withdrawal of the vote, which will take place this year, with Chavismo in power until 2019, - people on the streets of Caracas continued their usual daily activities as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Pellps got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested on Wednesday at Altamira Square.
In early 2014, Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicentre of sharp disturbances protesting against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever to achieve a referendum this year, people are no longer showing such energy across the country.
"I want a referendum, but I will not take part in the protests for security reasons," Deian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are less motivated.
Tibisej Lusen, Chairman of the Election Board, comments on the claim that the government is delaying the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for the protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijes, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, apart from all the barriers that the government has built to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go to the streets and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support: people came to an unprecedented number of signatures during the collection phase.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of arrivals on the myths is noticeably lower.
"Some people are focusing on creating food rows, while others are afraid after the arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator representing the opposition.
After Lusen stated that, by the next step in the referendum process - even more signatures for the whole country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the Socialist Government are saying that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelans, making them believe that voting this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next President.
If he is to be suspended today, he is obliged to announce universal suffrage.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon statement calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that Venezuelan constitutional rights were respected.
"The remaining steps to implement the presidential referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it stated.
Louis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 that changes are not expected as soon as possible.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government violate the law, but as a result they will achieve their goal if people do not protest loudly.
In September, the opposition called for a broad demonstration, first in Caracas, in order to demand that the process be speeded up so that the withdrawal can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilise the capital this day.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot be expected for such a long time.
"They should respond to the Lusen statement faster and stronger because it practically kills the referendum," said expert FNL.
The Congressman, Eredia, admitted that some opposition parties want to make the demonstration more rapid, while others want more time to organise the group.
The opposition must be cautious at the moment.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second campaign for collecting signatures will be low," Salamanka said.
The referendum process must receive support from twenty per cent of national voters, who are almost 4 million people, in order to be activated.
Salamanka and other analysts believe that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government concludes the road to elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said to FNL.
The Director of the LNSC A.Pukīte shall be temporarily suspended from office.
During the extraordinary meeting of Lielvarde Municipality Council on 12 August, the majority of Members supported the suspension of Ainars Puķis, Director of Lielvarde District Sports Centre (LNSC) from the performance of duties for a period of time while the service inspection is being carried out.
In the near future, it is planned to find out the circumstances that a visitor of a gym has written about in his application to the municipality.
In particular, during the visit to the gym, the LNSC client suffered a head injury.
The fault is Lielvārde Municipality Sports Centre.
Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and possible recourse of the client to the court, a commission was established by order of Lielvārde Deputy Chairman of the Regional Council Vita Volonte.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sports Centre and give an opinion by 16 August this year.
The next Tuesday is scheduled to re-introduce the extraordinary council meeting to decide on the next steps.
It should be noted that during a particular accident A.Pukītis was on vacation.
The Director of the Sports Centre shall be the Deputy Director of the Training Work Oksana Grimāļuka-Nazarova from Friday to the end of his trial.
For Ogres seniors, sport is a celebration.
Today, the Sport Festival of the Ogre Pensioners' Society took place at the Sports Center stadium of Ogre Municipality.
Sanita Tauriņa, who had prepared a special programme for the participants of the Sport Festival, was welcomed to the Seniors at the stadium.
This time individual results will not be assessed, but participants of the sports festival will be divided into four teams.
"The investment made by each participant will be as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
The participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball high speed, Eiffel tower construction together with a memory game, florball skiing, summer skiing.
In order to start successfully in all four disciplines of the festival program, participants had to perform the warm-up tasks - "Universal Circle", "Rinkis dancis", "Spleen", as well as three horse riding steps, to perform the frisbium and badminton elements.
All tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festival performed them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer skiing, which took place in the clothing prepared by the organizers, was a special admiration.
The competition was closely followed by volunteers from the Sports Centre of Ogre Municipality who led the tasks, recorded results and did not interfere with the advice.
There was also Ogre symbol Czekurs, who inspired the participants of the Sport Festival.
Ogres seniors proved to be active enough, attractive and in good sports form.
Peteris Zeps, a representative of the Green Team, dropped the ball into the basketball basket eight times within one minute, but Janis Staudzs, a member of his team, left only one successful drop behind.
In Ogre, pensioners are active.
The excursions are always full of buses and around 300 people arrive at the parties.
"Two times a week we meet at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novus, table tennis, use exercise equipment," says Jānis Staudzs, Chairman of Ogres Pensioners' Society.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received Thanksgiving from the Ogre Sports Centre for participation, but the greatest benefit is the movement in fresh air, good mood and shared time.
2016/2017 Prime Minister's Office No.19 West Bromovich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Note: this is not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalist's board as a whole)
Last season, position 14
Prospects to win in league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked like a new season event, such as the old Bromovich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again be a fight for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how empty is the glass under the more pragmatic management of Tony Pulis.
But then Jeremy Piss sold 88% of his club's shares to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in archetype-safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first dismissed manager.
The situation has undoubtedly changed in Balack Country - and not only the Hawthorns, but also a few miles northwest of Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, without having to waste time, gave up Kenyan Jacquet's services.
However, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, and the entrepreneur has also expressed his desire not to change the club’s culture.
"I don't want to change the club's morals or start unsustainable fun," he said when taking over duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we stay in the Prime Minister and then be further; I would like to see the club at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
This is what Pulis has achieved, and the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly divided fan base to hope for a quick break in the table up in order to realise that this is an extremely difficult task, given the considerable work recently invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
More work will be needed to go beyond the 14th place of last season.
Only Aston Villa, at the bottom of the table, hit fewer gates, and it is worth reminding us that during Christmas, Albion on average did less than one blow through the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst score of division.
They couldn’t get the gate 13 out of 38 games, and they only hit more than one gate in nine.
Of their 10 victories in any game failed to gain more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a dozen of 34 gates in total were obtained from standard positions.
It is no wonder that there was discontent in the Hawthorn team, perhaps most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 unarranged Villa at the end of January, when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six of the best teams had better security records - although no club has managed to list four centre semi-defences.
These guards are often underestimated, especially Johnny Evans, whom Arsenal wants to reach, given their recent crisis in the hands of injured players.
The international team of Northern Ireland experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time selling.
Ben Foster's gate is reliable and they're well-completed in the middle line.
Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still capable of playing at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob is undervalued.
It is disturbing to all sides that the long and curved story of Saido Berahino's future is still unclear.
At the owner's level, bets from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain calm and Mark Hugh is ready to wait.
It is worth taking action from all the parties concerned when they are close to liquidation after the last season.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, shaking him here on one side, here on the other side, it has long been apparent that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents on the change before allowing a former English U-21 member to go, but their 15 million-pound move with Diafra Saho collapsed a few days before taking over, claiming that he passed a medical examination and agreed on everything, but that he had a back injury, which would mean he had to miss the start of the season.
This puts great pressure on the Venetian Solomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful for a moment last season, but he has to improve his nine gate performance, especially if Ricky Lambert will continue to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anichebi and Stephen Sesegnon also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous for his slow young players moving up and three of them - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts's appearance in the last game of the previous season with the draw 1-1 by Liverpool, will hardly become the norm.
He will return to those who have already been tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping his eye on it.
The 17-year-old attacker took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999, who is also highly appreciated in the English youth football system.
Matt Phillips, with 5.5 million contracts with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who took part in the first race weekend.
It would not be encouraging if the end were to be rather hasty.
"All," Paul said last month to Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen rear players, middle players and front players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
It turns out to be much more difficult to get them than expected, mainly because of uncertainty about the take-over process.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
In the meantime, pressure on Pulis will become less or unbearable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised pension changes
After Tata Steel UK, pension agents said that the scheme could be restructured without involvement of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company’s chances of concluding a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a liability of GBP 15 billion and an estimated deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious obstacles to a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the future of a British business employing 11 000 people following negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the UK business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the authorised chairman of the pension scheme, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments with a deficit reduced to GBP 300 million for individual measures.
Johnston said that the trustees acknowledge that it is "not realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a more binding option than to join the PPF, he added, where employees should accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel companies since the negotiations on the future of its British business started in March, and it has been used as a brief moment in the negotiations with the British Government.
Cushik Chatterier, Tata Steel Europe Executive Director, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more sustainable.
Speaking at the Cular Tata Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chatterier said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes progressed, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders such as the Wales Government, etc.," said Chatterier, reports the Times of India.
There is a belief that pensions have some impact on the business of goods like steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The willingness of pension trustees to cooperate in negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes in the scheme include shifting the way annual inflation-based benefit increases are measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnston added: "The full-time employee and his advisors have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay the modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low risk profile outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the financing position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent fall in the securities market in the same way as other British pension schemes.
CBS commentator mixes Michael Pelps and Ryan Lochti all the race lengths
The Canadian broadcaster CBC’s commentator on the Olympics caused anger on Thursday evening, mixing Michael Pellps with his competitor Ryan Lochti.
Eliot Friedman mixed both of them for the entire 200 m of individual swim, in which Pelps won, winning his 22. Olympic gold medal.
When Pleps crossed the line, he was held by Friedman as Lochti, a fellow countryman of Pleps, and an ancient competitor at the top of the world’s swimmer’s top.
Freeman said, "He'll end up doing it!"
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Pells in this race!
Pelps could not even get to the honorable pedestal.
However, Pelps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
Immediately after Pellps was at the gold, the CBS broadcast became quiet.
Frīdsman miraculously immediately admitted his mistake.
I'm sorry, I mixed the tracks.
Pelps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was appreciated on a large scale after a mistake, acknowledged his mistake again in the next hours after the event and apologized to the viewers on Twitter.
I'm all sorry.
I was surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Pelpss overcame 2 168 years old record as the winner of the largest number of Olympic victories ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonid of Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympics than anyone else.
Russian hackers have attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
The hackers made public the lists of General Philip Bradlow and the data on the work of one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who, some time ago, might have attacked and published the e-mails of the US Democratic Party may also be responsible for the new series of attacks, reports agent Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber attackers have attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Philip Brīdlov and the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers published the resulting information on DCLeaks.com.
There are written by Bradlovas and data on the activities of the Open Society Institute.
Hackers have been reported to have access to fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that this is about the same hackers who attacked the U.S. Democratic Party computers and are led by the Russian special service.
The U.S. intelligence service warned the Congress's high officials about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party a year ago.
The Reuters news agency reports that it has information that special services told a number of politicians that cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or organisations controlled by them.
But the conventionmen have not been able to pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it was secret.
The scandal about attacks on the Democratic Party's computers began after about 20 000 e-mails were published on the Internet, written by the party's representatives during the pre-election campaign of the US President.
The candidate for the party, Hilaria Clinton, announced that this letter was organized by Russian special services.
The Russian President's press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorists.

Parking in the most happy place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
Disneyland has presented information on its long-planned parking structure, which consists of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge in the eastern part of the park.
The project, located east of the amusement park 5 Freeway, includes a 6 800 parking structure and a transport hub where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can miss out on the park visitors.
The pedestrian bridge over the port boulevard connects the recreation park with the structure of the parking lot and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned expansion project of the 14 acre area of the Land of Star Wars, is part of the USD 1 billion promised investment in Anaheim City in exchange for 30 years of exemption from the object tax.
The construction of the project, which synchronises with the Eastern Gate, will start next year.
The structure of the parking lot will be established above the Publa, the hero of Disney, with about 1 300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property acquired by the amusement park in 2014.
The project is expected to be launched in 2018.
"The Eastern Gate is part of our significant investment in the town of Anaheim, which will provide additional parking places for visitors and help reduce congestion in the vicinity of the recreation park, as we continue to expand the Disneyland Recreation Park," said Disney's representative Suzie Brauna.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the shoreline will be closed; it must be taken into account.

In Liepaja, two thirds of its population will have to agree to the insulation of the house.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specifically talked about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that from this year onwards, any apartment building will be eligible for EU co-financing, only if it is necessary to warm up the facade of the building.
In the past, it could only be used in serial apartment houses.
The main concerns of house managers are the organization of meetings of apartment owners.
A major problem, where the process is currently delayed, is that 67% of apartment owners need consent.
"The previous programme required 51%," says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager of LNA Ltd.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in most general meetings such number of apartment owners does not arrive", says Gints Ločmelis, project manager of the company "Home Service APSE".
The biggest house managers in Liepaja - "Home Service APSE" and LNA, who serve around 900 buildings, are planning to renovate at least 50 apartment houses by 2020 in the new planning period.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works at the beginning of the work, but with each implemented project the attitude of the citizens should improve.
I also had to get a bank credit, 76% of the population.
"Conversing, explaining what will happen - I still received the signatures," says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest building in Latvia.
John agrees with her, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, you can't have half figured out, and the other half plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it's important that everyone agrees with the whole event," John points out.
Such a change of rules has been proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been the experience in the last programming period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the owners of the apartments would be required.
As one of the recommendations for house managers Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union funds department of the Ministry of Economics, mentions the opportunity to introduce to citizens existing examples and various benefits of renovation of buildings, such as energy saving.
As a young man, Aaron was long angry with the world about the death of his mother.
A potential suicide bomber detention operation in Canada was worthy of press films.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video intercepted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video of the so-called "mortgage" recorded by an unknown person who was clearly at the final stage of the attack.
"And he was going to work it with a self-made explosive," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada Mike Kaban.
In a video in black mask, a man in English and Arabic threatened the Canadians and promised to avenge what they had done to Muslims.
In about three hours, Canadian police managed to identify this man by means of facial and voice recognition computer programs.
That was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the Probation Service for praising the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment, Driver was prohibited from doing so in the future and from engaging in any radical organization.
However, until then, the authorities did not believe that Driver could pose any physical danger to others.
When the police arrived at his home in Stratroi, the province of Ontario, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the security guards tried to arrest him, but while sitting on the back seat, Driver had activated the bomb.
In order to prevent the detonation of another explosive, the police have shot at the young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's got.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
In an interview with Canadian television, Wayne Driver, the father of a neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islam as a teenager.
It had initially helped him cope with drugs and alcohol.
But Aaron was a problemsome teenager who was long angry with the world about the death of his mother, and his father added.
Only when I saw that video in the news today did I realize how far he had gone.
I didn't know he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he could speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments could have been much different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian athletes.
In Ineta Radēvičs' Olympic studio, the former Olympic woman and the LTV student said that the performance of the seven-fighter Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa on Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad, considering that the athletes had an injury.
In the high jump, Laura made a breakthrough with his right leg, not as usual with his left.
Radēviča pointed out that it is comparable - like a person who is used to writing with the right hand, suddenly would be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, Ikniece-Admidiņa's result is not bad because of the injury.
Radēviča discovered that she had not yet contacted Ikaunieka-Admidiņa, but actively followed her start-ups and felt with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's injury recently and expressed her support for the athletes, pointing out that the athletes did not start to make pillows for themselves, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
When talking about other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic laws are very high, therefore one of the Latvian athletes is accused that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She remembered that she herself, while travelling to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, was called a tourist, and this causes negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her beginnings, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not my results", Radēviča revealed her experience in sport.
She told me that it was always important that there was a person in the tribunals who would give the energy of the accompaniment.
Radēvičs herself will be a tourist this year - she will already go to Rio de Janeiro next week to support Latvian athletes.
She says you're sure you're gonna go to the showroom competition.
In 2010 Ineta Radēviča won the European champion title.
In 2004 she took the 13th place in the Olympic Games in Athens at a long distance and in the 20th position in a three-step jump, but in the Olympic Games in 2008, the athletes did not start because they were waiting for their son.
In London, as has already been mentioned, Radēvičs had 4th place in a long jump.
The film "Quantum Code" with the physicist Kashcheyev's main role will be shown in Murjani.
According to the film, along with the division of electrons in the laboratory Kashcheyev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civicly minded man and father looking for a connection with Visgaleno.
The film's hero himself indicated in the Latvian Television programme "Erita Panorama" that the film was an interesting experience for him.
I learned about how to make cinema, how to film it, how to record sound.
"And actually fantastic work," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film had been produced in two years.
The biggest differences with the director have been about the title of the film.
I'm absolutely against this name.
No quantum code.
"There is no secret that you can find out when you see a film and it's all clear," said the associate professor of LU.
Kashcheyev admitted that he likes the film's premieres on Murjan's open-air cinema evening.
They are organized by friends from the Foundation's Easy, and these cinemas will take place every evening until September 9.
In Thailand, four people died in bomb explosions at tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, on Thursday and Friday five provinces of southern Thailand - the popular tourist destinations - had a series of bombs that killed four people and injured many people.
The first two explosions sinked at the seaside resort in Huahina on Thursday evening, the next Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police reported that one Thai woman had died in the first explosion and that 20 people had been injured, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions were sinked in the southern cities of Phuquet, Tran and Surathon.
Two bombs exploded in Patonga, a suburb of Phuketet, and two more in Phanna, a tourist region north of Phuketet.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bomb bombs have broken down in Thailand.
On Friday, the Thai Royal Police Officer Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen announced that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered to be local sabotage acts.
"It's too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"However, we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any form of terrorism; in fact, it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find the perpetrators."
On 12 August 2016, the investigators collected evidence from the scene of the crime following the bombing of small-capacity bombs in Huahin.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb explosions in important tourism areas in Thailand. Competent authorities are trying to identify the motive and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and no special group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosions took place the same week when the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - rejected the referendum supported by the military, and in the south-eastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population are Muslims, more than 6 500 people have died in riots since 2004.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Siricita of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
Huahin is located in Klai Kangwon Royal Palace, or "the castle far from anxiety", where the royal family of Thailand often resides.
King Bumbolo Adulyadei was the longest - ruling monarch in the world.

Porgis and Bess - what we have long deserved!
There are countless operas that have never sounded in Latvia.
There's something very rare.
However, it seems strange if since the 1970s Georges Geršvins Opus Porgius and Bess have not been staged or played, unless they count the chrestomatic solo number such as the periodic swiveling of Summertime on the stage (including as a title sound at the summer festival organised by Inese Galante), individual student projects, guest performances and the like.
It has its own reasons: since Latvia has been a country of the civilized Western world, it is bound by the rules of the family heirs of Gēršvins and copyright licences, which are valid for Porgy and Besso until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black when creating a full production.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts around this opera in the USA are little known in terms of race and it would be difficult for the composer to fulfil his desire.
The concert by compromise was performed with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters on August 6 with the help of the 10th anniversary of the Cesis Art Festival, reiterating Gēršvin's magical sound recording, which presents European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gossiples, fashion dances and memories of the beginning of the 20th century.
First of all, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Poga.
Despite the complex spatial arrangement of the concert performance in the open-air park of Cesis Castle, the orchestra was on the stage next to the stage, on which the soloists performed and sang (and great dance!) choir While the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, contrast-rich and accurate both in strings, metal blow instruments and piano party (Martins Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the great soloist team.
Harismatic dramatic baritone Lester Linch (Porgy) is a European and American-loved singer whose repertoire includes both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially in Verdi operas.
Porgija has sang his role many times, and Krauna has also sang his role in this opera – he felt like a fish in the water and inspired the stage partners to create an emotional atmosphere of solidarity among the poor people of the fishing village during the concert.
In its second concert of Porgia and Bessa (the first one took place in 2012 no more than with Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retle), Letonia Moore revealed itself as a vital combination of various vocal styles with a dramaticly toned timbre and fantastic piano in the top register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of the brightest of modern - day Aida.
The attractive Thai tenor, Germein Smith, who Andris Poga once looked at at in Boston, is the image of the narcodilian Sportinlaiff, a firm's role on four continents.
In it he demonstrates his synchronous dance and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smith is one of the rare wilds whose voice seems to be hiding still undiscovered vocal possibilities than 15 years ago, when the opera's voice was accidentally found in caricing it in order to mock peers.
Unbelievablely, even from line 24 and relative darkness, the expressive sign language of Germein Smith lets you see in his hands a dust bag of happiness even if it's not there.
How can the poor Bess not follow such a mephistophile tempter who is in vain to believe the illusion of a wonderful life in New York City?
The role of the cargo was represented by the tembrally generous Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team at Cesis was Sirina, represented by Sonora Vaice, a luxurious top register, a skillful balancing between the spoken and sang text, correspondingly changing the voice position, the performance of vocal acrobatics and dramatism both in Sirina's pity My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized forefather's amplified prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson sounded well in Klara's role, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning expressed a little bit of a loud and nervous song, gaining its true character in the rapture.
The colorites and magnificent presentations were made by Mihail Čuļpayev, Rihards Macanovskis, and the parties entrusted to Andris Lapiņš (especially the Krabs seller in response to Irma Pastare's sounding strawberry seller in Soprano tesitūra).
Bright characters in the images of Ilona Bagele, Rihard Miller, Emils Kivlenieks, as well as the roles played by Ivo Martinsons, the investigator and the unexpectedly presented director of the Cesis Festival and actor Juris Zagars to the audience.
In the spatial concept of the concert performance by Viesturs Kairišs, the choir worked on steps, soloists – mainly in the proscenary, rarely once when they entered or went on the stairs.
In a sufficiently dynamic way, a little comical situation was made by sheet folders in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has quite a prosthetic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes made it difficult to track their stage identity).
Secondly, in Porgia and Bess, there are many dialogues, a phrase placed in the conversation, a replica that is easier to trace in front of the notes.
The audience studied the details of the opera action in Cesis was very helpful in the titrating machine.
The weather did not clarify, and the first part of the concert was for quite a long time.
However, it did not prevent most of the audiences from staying to the end in order to vex the artists.
Nine in the evening, however, is a rather late start time for a full-length opera, especially if a longer homeway from Cesis is expected, however, opera Porgijs and Bessa have returned worthyly to Latvian music and are likely to become one of the brightest musical adventures of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it was spoken yesterday evening, as well as under quite other acoustic conditions.
In Riga, the man was afraid of children with an axe.
On August 11, around 8:00 p.m., the State Police received a message from a single grandmother of a frightened child who was concerned about the fact that there was a man on Lomonosova Street, in a children's court, who was afraid of children with an axe.
Law enforcement officers immediately responded to the call and arrived at the venue of the event, where they also met this man with an axe, who at the time of the event was under the very strong alcohol - 3.07 promols.
It was found that a man who was born in 1962 had previously frightened children so that they did not noise.
This time, however, an aggressive man used an axe to scare children’s household equipment to scare them.
The man was arrested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated in connection with a serious disturbance of public order, which is manifested by obvious disrespect for society or shamelessness, ignoring the general norms of conduct and undermining human peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years, or by temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by a fine and by the supervision of probation for a period of up to three years.
Federation presidents usually use guest accreditation in the Olympic Games.
The presidents of sports federations usually arrive at the Olympic venue for a few days and use guest accreditations, which can be changed, so they have several owners during the competition, and the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa told the agency LETA.
On Wednesday, an extensive hustle appeared after the statements of the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Jakubovsky, who discovered that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro Olympics to visit the Head of the Latvian Bathing Federation (LPF) Kaspars Mr.
Later, it became known that Mr. Brasília had arrived with a coach accreditation, about which the President himself was surprised because "now there is no way in".
As explained by Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations lived in London Olympic Games - Sir, as well as Guntis Zalītis, the Head of the Latvian Athletics Union (LVS).
The Olympic village is home to athletes, as well as official persons, including e.g. coaches, doctors, the administration of the delegation.
So, probably in London, Mr. Master was also accredited as a trainer.
"The other presidents of the federations come as guests, and their accreditations are interchangeable - they come for a few days and then someone else uses it", said Vilciņa, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro arrived at the end of July and Brazil will leave on 13 August, so he is likely to be the longest of the Presidents of all national federations.
Significantly, Latvian athletes started swimming only one day - 10 August.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports in Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and LETA estimates show that the presidents of six or seven federations will take part in the four-year competition.
The hall will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be on the BMX competition planned next week, and the President of the Windsurfing Federation of Latvia Ansis Dāle will fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16, when both Ketija Birzule and Dzintars Urbančiks, the President of the Latvian Fighting Federation, have finished their start.
The President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš also planned to arrive next week, when the shooter Dainis Upelnieks will have finished his start.
The President of the Latvian Judo Federation Raimonds Rublovskis was not present in Rio de Janeiro, although his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation does not currently have a president, but the Latvian Weightlifting Society continues to have a conflict and its athletes are announced by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to come to Rio de Janeiro.
Vassiliev appreciates natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiliev is very often visiting Latvia during the last years.
More recently, he evaluated the contestants at the "Miss and Misters Latvia 2016" final and admitted that, unlike Russian figurers, Latvian carpenters can be proud of their natural breasts and lips, which have not been improved with silicone and botulinum injections.
In his conversation with "Western News", Alexander Vassiliev told us that for many years he has been the President of the jury at the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That's why he was very interested in the evaluation of "Miss and Misters Latvia 2016" participants.
When asked how Latvian beauty competition standards differ from similar competitions in Russia, Vassiliev stressed that Latvians and Russians have very different figures: "The Russian beauty competition participants have bigger breasts than Latvians."
However, Latvian young women are beautifully dressed and encrypted, as well as can be proud of their natural beauty, not the miracle works performed by plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition on their natural beauty.
Vassiliev has big plans for his professional activities in Latvia.
Currently, the fashion historian's collection exhibition "Creatured Nature" is on display at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, Livonian Order Castle, there is an exhibition of Vassiliev's "Woodwear 1860-2010".
Vassiliev loved Ventspils so much that he also enjoyed the hospitality of the city for a couple of days and went on a walk along the sea.
I like it very much in Latvia.
Especially now that there is a terrorist threat across Europe, there is a real corner of paradise.
"It is a pure pleasure to spend time and relax in Latvia", said the fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23 Alexander Vassiliev will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Please help me!
Please donate for our son, brother, grandson.
As a family of Rinald, we are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God for the opportunity to save Rinald, but unfortunately, at the moment there is no way to fully bear the medical costs of our own.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11 - year - old Tubular who was diagnosed with brain cancer at the end of July.
This year he finished 4th grade at the Milzkalne Primary School with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
I think everything gave up to him.
A healthy, happy, persistent, hardworking and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will remain in our family’s memory for life.
The last few weeks were suffering from nausea and headache, but doctors have put it on the stomach virus.
And at first it seemed like that.
For who could imagine that such "innocent" symptoms were to blame there is something more serious that cannot be seen in mind.
We got a diagnosis on July 26, Rinald has a brain tumor.
There is a rapid accumulation of fluid in the brain, but all doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a bypass operation to release excess fluid, because for direct surgery, the tumor is practically not available.
Nor can it be determined whether the tumour is benign or malignant.
Further State-paid plan: start radiation and watch what happens.
Looks like a nightmare like this -- we're going to experiment here, we're going to check out the results.
Fortunately, Rinald's findings were presented to a doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World Neurosurgical Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgical surgeons.
He took on an operation, and it turned out that he had to operate immediately.
The tumor puts enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, already on August 8, Rinald and his mother, Evy, were in Spain, and on August 9 they were operated.
A very complex operation lasting more than 6 hours was performed.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumor, reduce pressure, obtain analysis samples.
Rinald is now getting out of bed and asking for frie potatoes as a good teenager.
Now we just have to wait for the results of the oncological analysis.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the clinic's management, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full payment for treatment before surgery.
With confidence that the remaining amount will be paid, they only claimed a first contribution of EUR 10 000 in order to operate and save Rinald's life.
The parents managed to provide €6 000 by selling the equipment, while the rest of the necessary amount for travel expenses, accommodation, the first contribution of the hospital was borrowed from relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 is still needed to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and to pay back the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us return this, Rinalda's health so important, surgery.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation that has already taken place and to enable Rinalda’s treatment to continue successfully.
The signs of anxiety in Ukraine raise the question: What does Vladimir Putin think?
It has been concluded that these claims are true.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some of the signs of a Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to hinder Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting or misinterpreting events for political purposes, especially in the context of Ukraine's ongoing conflict.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Former so-called ‘Minister of Justice’ of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
The attempted attack in Crimea is still a topical issue, although there are very few grounds for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor such a scenario.
Whatever happened, the images found by the analysts of the open source show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the expected attack took place.
They show how heavy weapons convoys, including missile systems designed to protect the coast, are moving on the peninsula.
Obstructively Known Russian Escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had planned rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a very coincidence that it just happened in one of the most stressful times since annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known during the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, no matter how realistic it may be, for what greater purpose.
The analysts point to worrying parallels with Russia's behaviour just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
Former so-called ‘Prime Minister’ of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists failed in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed to "defence" the ethnic Russian civilian population in Ukraine, who is being attacked by him.
He organized a relief convoy to a region that, according to NATO, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr. Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some mentioned whether only Moscow is planning another military intervention.
The fights in eastern Ukraine have intensified, as was the case before the invasion in August 2014.
But this seemingly parallel could be the point of introducing fear of military activities rather than of actual activities - this will give Putin a brief moment both in relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Former so-called ‘Prime Minister’ of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
"There is a very small opportunity if Russians really plan some large-scale offshore," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy to create pressure."
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which were once a mechanism by which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly considered to be unsuccessful and irrelevant.
By promising that there is a danger that the conflict might come up again, Putin gives a new meaning to the negotiations: getting him off the edge of the abyss.
"It's a standard Putin tactics - he wants to try to start from a position of strength," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could make everything much more, much worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the tension in Crimea, it was not important to continue the negotiations, making the other parties convince him to return to the negotiating table and to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen itself as a world power, even though its economies are smaller than those of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having a right of veto on the sovereignty of Ukraine, keeping the country under Russian control to a certain extent.
This may also be in favour of Putin's long-standing hopes of a large-scale agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on Ukraine and Syria, under conditions favourable to Moscow, naturally, including the ending of Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin has spoken about this objective since the deterioration of the country's economic situation in 2014, on several occasions, mainly due to the decline in the value of the country's oil and gas exports.
Since the invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition in the fight against extremists.
However, Russian leaders can consider it necessary for them to secure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term of office expires.
The Russian official basically believes that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, although he is obviously friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be "seeking solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window of opportunities to make sure that something is done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a large-scale agreement cannot be reached, Putin seems to be satisfied with Russia's weak neighbour, mentioning what will be the next.
In the earlier version of this article, the year in which Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine was wrongly pointed out.
This was the case in 2014 and not in 2013.
At the end of the convention, the White House diverts resources to fight the Zika virus
The Obama Administration said on Thursday that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poor and health care programmes to pay for the development of a vaccine against the Zika virus, taking emergency measures, because Congress did not approve new financing to combat the virus.
In a letter to the members of the Congress, Silvija Metjus Barvels, the Secretary for Health and Humanitarian Services, pointed out that without the diverted resources, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Institute for In-depth Research and Development will remain free of money for the fight against skin-borne disease until the end of the month.
It would therefore be necessary to stop the development of the vaccine at an important moment, with the increase in the number of cases of Zika disease in the country in Miami.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zika virus occurred in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
Mrs. Barvela said that 15 babies were born with birth defects related to the Zika virus.
The virus can cause abnormalities in brain development and other serious defects in the babies born to infected mothers.
The spread of the disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has raised the political rates of federal government response.
Hillary Clinton stopped his campaign on Tuesday in Winwood, in the area of Miami, where there was an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus and put pressure on Congress to return from its five-week break in order to confirm the exceptional financing of the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Congress Republicans have been in contradictions for most of the year on Zika virus issues.
In February Obama asked for USD 1.9 billion in emergency financing.
The Republicans stopped it by asking for a more detailed account of what the money was going to be used for.
The co-legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the Democrats blocked the examination of the measure proposed by the Republicans, which would allocate $1.1 billion to the fight against the Zika virus, but would include conditions prohibiting the granting of funds to family planning for the provision of contraception for the virus that can be transmitted on the sexual route.
As a result of this impasse, the White House was forced to channel USD 589 million in April to fight against the Ebola virus.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvela said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be fully spent by the end of August.
"The inability to decide on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the development of the important vaccine and taking over other valuable national programmes to avoid this delay temporarily," Barvela wrote.
Democrats have attached themselves to this statement in order to criticise the Republicans for not giving extra money to fight the Zika virus.
At the news conference, representative of Nancy Pelosi from California, minority leader, invited representative Paul D.Raien, Spyker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress about the progress of this event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and now we are addressing the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Raien's advisors say that the transfer of funds is a long way from going and has been delayed by the Obama administration to bring maximum political benefits out of the problem of the Zika virus.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that it had started clinical trials of vaccine against Zika virus in 80 people and was looking forward to launching the second phase of "Zika virus epidemic countries" in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the investigation will stop.
Barvela said that she would divert $34 million from the National Health Service’s funds to find medicines for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical In-depth Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including USD 19 million from a programme that grants subsidies for heating oil to low-income families and USD 4 million from substance-dependent programmes such as opioids.
Even then, as Barvela said, additional money will only be sufficient for the next month, when the agencies will have to 'determinely narrow their activities' in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million on helping states protect pregnant women, $25 million on strengthening their preparedness and plans to fight the Zika virus, as well as $16 million on helping them set up data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with the Zika virus.
The Thai leader links attacks on tourist attractions with constitutional changes
The leader of the Thai junta has called on the country's people to be patient on Friday until the investigators find out who is behind the series of deadly bombs in Thailand this week.
General Prajut Chan-Oča, junta leader and Prime Minister, said that criminals were 'bad people' protesting against the new Constitution, which was confirmed by the voters in a referendum on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they were working already before the referendum," he said to the people.
The bombs in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in favorite places, killed four people and injured dozens.
The authorities claim that the incinerators' attacks elsewhere are linked.
Analysts claim that the purpose of bomb blasts was not to kill many people but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhina.
"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and the firefighters' attacks overturn the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fasuk, Senior Investigator of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have discredited consequences for the authorities, terrorise society and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo The Thai rescue staff cares for the injured in the Friday bomb explosion in Huahin.
The police claim that, in their view, these explosions are not linked to international terrorism or prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as "local sabotage" rather than terrorism.
The chosen timing and location of attacks has a strong political symbolism.
The explosions took place on Friday, when people were ready to celebrate Queen Siricita’s birthday, which is considered to be Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions drowned in Huahin, about 125 miles [125 km] from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give the military more powers, even if the government is again under civilian control.
The junta helped to ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, an expert in South-East Asia at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, has pointed to the military suspicion that the attacks have been carried out by people who are dissatisfied with the vote.
The explosions were "precisely coordinated, but obviously aimed at creating fear and anxiety, not mass damage and death and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular Yerevan temple in Bangkok.
The Thai authorities associated the bombings with Uighurs fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
The General Preijt, who has been leading the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was actively suspended, said that this week's explosions "relieved the hearts of the Thais".
Why now, when the country is doing better, when the economy is going better, and the tourism sector is doing better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
Gold reaction: what the historic moment of Simones Manuela looked like
As I started the fight tonight, I was trying to remove from my shoulders the black community's weight, which is something I'm carrying with me just in that position.
I hope, however, that all this will be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when there are more of us, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the name black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to win a gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to beat records.
This is not the case because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the protection of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego will jump off the shopping centre in Bogota, leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song Goodbye Cruel World.
His death was the beginning of the contradiction that emerged this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend L.G.B.T. rights were viewed in the wider political struggle that has divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother, Alba Reijes , lodged a complaint with the court against school officials, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was discovered that he and his classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Colombian Supreme Court issued a favourable judgment calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay right movement. Some time ago, this year, the movement celebrated the decision to legalise same-sex marriages.
However, this week, they faced an obstacle in their struggle for equality, because Jean Perody, the Minister for Education, who is openly gejistic, got a scandal about applying this rule to the scandal.
The scandal began when sexually exposed content from pornography began to circulate in social media, spreading the talk that it was part of a guide published by the Ministry of Education.
The perody effectively exposed it.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them focus on the rule, it has not tried to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools for resolving conflicts," Mrs. Perdodia said during the interview on Thursday.
The debate started before the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks are taking place between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, the Partisan Group.
The coalition of politicians in the government opposition and the leaders of the Catholic Church have been very quickly mobilised, indicting the government of the President, Juan Manuel Santos, for promoting one-sex union and gender change.
To make it all more difficult, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and equality between L.G.B.T., which calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace talks, dedicated to 42-year-old Perodia, the breeding star of Colombia's policy.
They have demonstrated in their homes the existence of sloppy posters and some have also threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glena, former trade ministers.
The perody maintained a wonderful peace throughout the week of anxiety, trying to correct the error and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who will still be revealed," she said.
This is a very tense field of work and a very limited time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of the FARC transaction as a turning point for the earthquake in the country, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is it a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked the question.
Although she has not been pleased this week to be the target of insults and accusations, she is pleased that gay students in modern Colombia can take an example from her and think that they too can try one day to become ministers.
"It is very important for me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs. Perodia.
We cannot wait for a new suicide to start to change something.
Keep the vote cyber-proof - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers away from election urns" (News article, August 4)
The Minister of Internal Security, Jeff Johnson, says that Obama's administration is thinking about additional protection for the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various manifestations and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in influencing our elections require the federal government to pay additional attention to ensuring our electoral system and perhaps to regard it as part of the essential infrastructure for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist in elections and offer help, advice and guidance from the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure this, it tells us that the process must start as soon as possible.
A writer, a democrat from Mississippi, is a member of a high-ranking National Security Committee.
A boy injured in retirement, this week's third case in amusement parks
On Thursday, after falling off the carousel, a boy was injured and taken to Pittsburgh Hospital. The emergency services and park officials say this week this is the third accident in the U.S. amusement parks where children have suffered.
A child whose name is undiscovered was taken to a child hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles [80 km] west of Aidlwaild and Soukzon’s amusement park in Lajonier, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the emergency services of the Westmurland district.
The three-year-old boy, who went with his brother while he was being helped on the ground, informed the park representative Jeff Krushor in the e-mail.
Cross said that the "Rollo Coast" attraction would be closed for the time of the event investigation.
Children shall be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long and shall be accompanied by adults of less than 4 feet (122 cm) in order to travel in carousel.
According to the information published on its website, the attraction was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it was tested in August.
The hospital representative for the boy’s medical condition refused to comment.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died of a neck injury from the world’s highest water hill in Kansassistia.
On Monday, three girls, aged 6, 10 and 16, who fell from more than 30 feet (9 meters) high, overturned the panoramic wheel basket during the fair in Greenville, Tennessee, report to the local media.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe will not visit the temple on the anniversary of World War II to commemorate those who died in war: Jiji
The Jiji news agency reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe will not visit the controversial Tokyo shrine on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, which honors the memory of those who died in war.
On Thursday Yi reported that Abe still planning to send Yasukuni to the temple a ritual gift for the anniversary.
It also honors the memory of 14 Japanese commanders who have only been convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea regard it as a symbol of Japan's wartime militaryism.
Abbi has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he announced that he had visited to show respect for those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese Minister for Defence, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the temple, explaining that this is a question of conscience.
Inada, a close associate of Abe and a supporter of amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution, has visited Yasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that the Minister for Reconstruction of the territories affected by the Japanese disaster, Masahiro Immamura, visited the temple on Thursday and said that he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, has become more tense following the increasing presence of China's coastguard and other national vessels near the controversial islands of the South Chinese Sea, which is known in Japan as Senca and in China as Diaouja.
Two suspects detained in planning the terrorist attacks of Rio Olympic Games: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people who are suspected of supporting the Islamic State of the Group during the planning of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to the operation on Thursday, 12 persons had already been detained by the police, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic State fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police reports that three more persons were interrogated and subsequently released.
The Brazilians are both arrested on Thursday, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there has been no conflict in Brazil's history with known militia groups, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more topical target, especially because the countries fighting against the Islamic state are taking part in the games.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has committed air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilian bombings and bombings.
Indictment by the French priest of the new suspect
Last month, as part of the French priest's murder investigation against a man arrested on Monday, official charges were made, and on Friday Reuters reported the source of information to the police.
A 21-year-old suspect is being investigated for his cooperation with terrorists, and he has planned attacks on people, mentioned the source of information.
The man had telephoneized with Adel Kermic and Abdeus Malica Petitjan, who stopped church services in St. John du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and cut his throat to the 85-year-old Roman Catholic pastor, Father Jacques Amel.
Both of them have been shot.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse to Saint-Leste du Ruwe and spent the night there in the days before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man, who had not previously had criminal convictions, admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the following day because he had no good relationship with Kermitch and Petitjan, said the source of information.
The investigators are trying to find out whether Kermanic and Petitjian had a presence in France and whether they were associated with an Islamic country that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
Petitján's cousin was under pre-trial arrest at the end of last month.
Doruss de Vriess goes for medical tests before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club goalkeeper Doruss de Vriess arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed at the entrance to Roshol hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
The head of the Parkhead Club Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard so that Kreig Gordon can compete with the current first number.
However, Roger trusts 35-year-old de Vries because he worked together with a Dutch woman at the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they won in 2011 under Rogers' leadership the right to move to the Premier League.
He changed the form of Wales that summer to join Vilnius, and since 2013 is City Ground.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the Dunfermline season, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in the Realm ended with disappointment, however, Pars experienced a double agony, being "sent into exile" from the highest level, before losing Celtic in the Scottish Cup.
A year was left in the Forest under contract and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to obtain his signature.
Macy's to close 100 shops.
Supermarket giant Macy's announced its plans to close 100 stores on Thursday, which is a dramatic step to help the chain of shops to get ahead of the potentially increased problem: in America, it claims to be an online shopping era for too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozens of underprofitable stores immediately after annual holiday fever.
However, when it comes to its summer statement that it will close 15 percent of its 728 outlets, the retail chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive position than many similar retailers in terms of reducing the number of their stores, adapting to the very changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers go by Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant announces that he plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the e-commerce boom.
For the supermarket category as a whole, times are more difficult, as customers increasingly choose lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, coupled with short-term difficulties such as the ever lower international tourist spending and the seasonally inadequate weather conditions that Macy's has put in a fragile situation that has been going on for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales had dropped by 2,6 per cent in the last quarter, a rather weak indicator, which however was an improvement in view of the very poor annual drop of 6,1 per cent observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenue was $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion in Canada), 3.9 percent less than in this period last year.
Macy's said that closing shops would cost about USD 1 billion in terms of annual turnover.
And closing such a large number of shops at the same time could be seen as recognition of the retailer's defeat.
However, the value of the company's shares dropped by 17 per cent on Thursday, indicating that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells us about the stronger future of Macy's.
In a sense, the fact that Macy's is reducing the number of shops should not be surprising.
The retailer’s director-general Terry Lundgren said in the past that there are simply too many shops in the chain.
The top leaders said for some time that they have adopted a new strategy, where particular emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable stores, trying to achieve higher sales volumes in already profitable outlets.
Jeff Jenette, Director of Macy's, who has been appointed as Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company plans to close are those where sales and profitability slip down.
"We are aware that we do not yet have an adequate return on investment in these outlets and often do not have a level of shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," says Janet.
The company announced that it would come up with a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that there is still a decision about the shops to close and that, therefore, it is not yet clear exactly how many staff will be made redundant.
The retailer will not leave the main markets where he currently has shops, but it will think about closing shops that are less active.
This move is likely to dislike shopping centre managers who count on large tenants like Macy's to attract and keep other smaller shops in their shopping centres.
Do your water bottle contain dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle can be “a lot worse than licking your dog’s toy”, considering how many bacteria will be faced.
Website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 different types of water bottles - with screw cap, with push cap, with push cap, and with straw.
Each bottle of athletes had been used for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle can be as dirty as the dog’s toy.
"On the basis of our 12 tested water bottles, we found that the re-usable beverages can contain an alarmingly large number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CVV/sq.cm.)," said the Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest number of microbes, more than 900 000 colony forming units per square centimetre (CVU/sq.cm.)
Bottles had microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with push-in stoppers were the next worst with 162 000 CFU/ sq.cm., while containers with screw-in stoppers contain only slightly less than 160 000 CFU/sq.cm.
"To drink water from such bottles may be worse than to eat from your pet's dish", is indicated on the website.
A much better picture is seen for straw-based bottles, where only a part of the bacteria in other bottles were found - only 25 CFU/sq.cm.
This may be because the water is poured down to the lower part of the straw instead of sticking to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in the straw bottles are described as "mostly harmless".
"Based on the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, because of the small number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," says the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean will have fewer microbes.
On the website readers are advised to wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion Must Be Modern or Forget
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls also prove true in the elections themselves, in January America will inaugurate its first president, the woman.
Last week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Maya discussed Britain's withdrawal from European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been raised in such a way that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity thanks to education, ambition and hard work.
And today young girls can focus on a number of existing role models, acting in the highest field of leadership.
So, has the long and hard struggle for equality between women finally ended?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In religious terms, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be consecrated in the Catholic Church.
The English church consecrated Libya Leina as the first female bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Judaism movement has been assigned to women rabbi since the beginning of the 1970s and the conservative movement since the beginning of the 1980s, orthodox Judaism still has a very severe resistance to the concept of women rabbi.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbi Council, in its third attempt to halt the increasing wave of support for the appointment of Orthodox women, published a rather harsh message about the conflict between the concept of female Rabbi and the law.
Not without irony when Hillary Clinton was nominated as candidates for the office of President of Democrats, a group of American leading Orthodox rabbis who opposed the coordination of women began a series of 'debates' on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacral?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it sees as lasting traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to withstand pressure to adapt to changing societies.
Those who oppose the coordination of women do so on the ground that it is not "traditional".
However, the preservation of tradition has its own price in this way.
And the price of such one-sided thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition itself by taking away the oxygen needed by the traditional community to maintain its vitality.
In the book "August firearms", in the military history of the First World War, Barbara Tachmen highlights the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the tragedy of red trousers".
Until the beginning of World War I, when the war passed from war on close distances to the heavier artillery that is being transmitted from a distant distance, it became profitable to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with boring greys and browns.
However, French soldiers still wear the same red hats and pants that made them easy to use.
The suggestion made by the French Minister for War Affairs, Adolf Messimie, that the armies under his command could do the same, was perceived with ridicule and resistance.
The red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and military traditionals were not prepared to abandon it.
In his speech in Parliament, the former Minister for Military Affairs, Eižen, spoke on behalf of France.
"Discard from the red pants?" he cried.
Never!
"This unspeakable and idiotic supplement at the most visible of all colors," then wrote the Mesimium, "should have had bad consequences."
Leaders of faith who are fighting for the inclusion of women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking an important question: "What changes are needed to make religion flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
To insist that men continue to wear pants when it comes to religion can be traditional, but as the breakdown of red trousers shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is a UK founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) and a student of orthodox rabbinism at the Jeshiwatt Maharata in New York.
The children of the district of Roja learned new skills in the camp.
From 1st to 6th August, the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre hosted a camp "Varavisksnes Bridges", during which participants showed creative expression, sport, as well as learned new skills.
We arrived at the camp on the final day when children were very enthusiastic to paint jars of glass.
Māra Folkmane, youth specialist at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, said that this was one of the activities where participants liked the most.
It was also a great joy to visit Einars Kalniņš' carpentery "Mazbebriņi".
Most of the children liked the laser engraving because it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer was gradually applied on the board.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects should be studied at school if he wants to work in carpentry, i.e. the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer knowledge, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed that this profession should work more with the brain than with the muscles.
There are individual orders in the small hall, and it is important to plan everything first.
To get to know each other better, when the camp started, participants participated in various games, as well as jointly formed camp "arms".
On Wednesday, a walk along the sea from Roja to Jocene took place, and natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used to make cards.
Sports games were also held, which are particularly important for participants.
We went to apartment houses, where we have a sports and recreation area, played football and a network ball.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they demand something sports.
Girls like quieter jobs.
On the other day, with the help of self-hardening mass, we decorated jars, which can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose with whom to perform, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Table games were also played, everyone could show their knowledge during the photo orientation, where they had to find objects and take pictures.
The task was to come together differently in each picture.
We also painted mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that everyone will like - sport is closer to one another, creative lessons to another.
"Now it seems that everyone is passionate about painting glass", explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas on creativity, sports, as well as assistance were awarded - several children helped directly in economic works.
The name of the camp "Varavisnes tilts" is created because children from three associations participate in it - Rojupe and Melnsils Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the Multifunctional Centre "Strops" of Roja Municipality.
These are the connecting bridges.
If roosters come up with something faster, we borrow ideas; on the contrary, they borrow from us.
We share experience.
This year 30 participants - children, who were active during the year, were involved in the camp.
"We were expecting to be 30, and it also happened," M. Folkmane says.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010 when the Social Service of Roja decided that it was necessary to organise camps in summer for large families and children of poor families.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Paradise has improved, and the camp is now for the people of the district who come and work in the youth centers.
The aim is to spend leisure time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
Two camps took place in the past and 20 children took part in each of them, while at present only one camp is organised due to the overall decrease in the number of children in the country.
Similar activities are taking place in the rest of the year.
Children draw, paint glass, visited Einars Kalniņš, who taught burning wood, making machines from wood, and saw various forms with a saw.
There is also a new technique - anchoring, it is painting with hot wax crystal.
Under the direction of the teacher Ilze Shelkova, we had lessons made from polymer material, and made columns and various dishes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, in autumn we collect leaves.
We try to use what we have around.
The Youth Centre works in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, while in summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"A youth centre is visited on average by 15 children a day", says M. Folkmane.
She stressed that the Roy County Council was very supportive, which understood the need to allocate funds to children because they were building our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only get a season ticket if they sign a behavioural agreement" and agree not to criticise the club in social media.
Although we admit that everyone has the right to his or her personal opinion, publication of confusing comments on such websites does not benefit.
The fan of the administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the former senior police inspector Klif Eger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police force.
The letter goes on to say: "I have to inform you that the granting of a season ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign a "Harmonised Behavior Contract" (ABC), which states that you will refrain from publishing derogatory or confusing comments about people representing a club or a club on social media websites of all kinds, or any other kind of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
As regards Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the payment of the season ticket, which was not received, and two days later a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too "tweet" to make tweet others who are funny."
Cycling holidays on the coasts of Dalmatia
What do you mean, "greasy"?
I'm driving here with all my strength," said Colina, former U.S. Navy Commander, who has just travelled 25 miles of cycling along the central part of an uneven Croatian island without leaving anything there, except a spooky sweat and a green seamen's expression ejected in hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing anthems or a number of kindergarten poetrys to make it easier to get to the mountain.
Colin's friend Petie recommends "The Little Engine That Could".
Others count rhymes or simply suffer quietly, thinking about what it requires to get to a position similar to that of a hard - tempered cyclists.
Colin's lumas are poisonous rather than diverse.
To drive a few yards forward is as if Hugh Grantt were going after him as if he were at the beginning of the film "Four Wedding and One Funeral".
Her and my mission is a week-long "luxuous" yacht and a cycling trip along the Croatian North Dalmatian coast and islands organized by Freedom Treks.
Cycling under the heat of summer in a steep mountainous place like Croatia may not correspond to everyone's understanding of luxury, but it is said that Northern Dalmaty is easier to ride than South Dalmaty, our saddles are soft, and when we filled in the forms of reservation, freely and confidently all those months ago, there was a box that we did not mark, which could have provided us with a battery-charged e-cycle.
The luxury part of the transaction is our floating house for a week, the brand new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bikes in a stack near our guides Ivan and Ivan and at the end of the ship, jump the hearing in blue water without coming into contact with sea urchins, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone lanes, which the Croatians call the beach.
In June, the sea temperature is perfect, and everyone agrees: cool enough to cool, but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing rubles and some kayaks if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the saddles.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioning, where Helena, the ship's massier - I'm not kidding - will have already laid our beds, replenished our minibar supplies and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that biking is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to play on our beds or with pillows on the upper deck together with bartender Antonio, who is always ready to cook one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, not a proud super yacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to be part of it.
Colin and Petty belong to the meetup.com group of friends from Washington, D.C. (Columbia Region): at sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s boat and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even richer, and they are now in Croatia.
The competing chapel from their church is sailing and cycling on holidays in Provence, and every afternoon air is thickened by the pingpong rally of competing Facebook publications.
The holiday adventure element may be exaggerated because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"Brokastis and dinner are eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started our way from the beautiful port of the old Trogira, which is near Split.
One ship’s call signal shows that the cupboard is open, while the other at the end of the meal calls for silence and careful listening to further information.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that may have been lost everywhere, but not in British contingents.
What a difference - the fun has already taken a turn, the jokes are out of abundance, while Ivana releases daily excursion cards, but we all pretend that we are afraid of swings, contour outs and profiles with climbs and falls, although anything else would be a surprise for Croatia's cycle, which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
Total plainness is not recommended.
Ivan hosts an informational meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with dozens of different nationalities, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British - who easily sit down at tables where two speak English and one German.
We're all friends on the road.
Cycling promotes friendship, and the only competition is inside, that is, by itself.
I do not remember when group dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxing.
Soon we're on Ivan's wave.
A slight rise is a slope that should not be confused with a roughness, which is a good thing.
Mats are serpentines and straight ahead means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "Drive one by one, take a distance, and it's not a race.
I'll see you on the coast of nine.
All right, five pairs, I forgot you were on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
From Trogira we will go north on a two-day cruise through the Kornati Archipelago, where we will go almost all the way to Dougi Otok - the Croatian "long island" - and after a little sleep we will go for a walk along the Telašcica Nature Park to admire the steep rocks and salt lake, where sea water flows under the underground channel.
It is said that those who bathe in it thanks to its strength become younger.
If we do, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we are again turning south, moving from the continent to the nearby islands seemingly by chance.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the outside of the country with wide sea views and diverse plantland: olive groves, vineyards, sharp plant noises, Mediterranean scents and countless butterflies in flight.
As we move forward, there's always a break, but when Ivan stops, there's always a big shadow, and the little mouse is like a prize for those who come faster.
Sports and social activists travel a lot during weekends, and they know the behavioral standards by sending warnings in a row and leaving space for motorists to perform overtaking manoeuvres much more safely.
"You were almost hit," one cyclist says to the other after the truck driver decided to take an overtake manoeuvre in an opaque curve and quickly slowed down.
Happily, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short section of driving on the main roads, with Ivan at the very back, to encourage and "put the pace", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all come together, get off the bikes and safety after the transition with our bikes on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows that he doesn't talk to a group of children?" asks the Swiss cyclists when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be spent on leisure.
The city’s visit to Zadar reveals the Roman Forum and the Sea Organs, playing music that sounds like a mob of a imprisoned sea monster, through stoned pipes in promenade and open in water.
Zadar's famous sunset falls perfectly between the main meal and the bottle, and after the darkness we return to the sea organs and watch the wave-powered lamps in the glass trotuary, which is actually the dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning starts the road to the busy Biograda resort, the organ song is no longer more than a laughter.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the Kraka River estuary to view its waterfalls; then an afternoon tour in Sibenika, where we look at the Cathedral of Thought, the masterwork of Dalmatia Renaissance, as well as a chair-time walk along the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lourda is going to pick up pilgrims in the shadow of an attack
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gather at the temple of Lourdes Our Lady.
The French security forces are alert, for thousands of Catholics gather at the Lourdes temple on an annual pilgrimage under the shadow of several terrorist acts.
On August 15, each year, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains for the Festival of Ascension to celebrate the reception of the virgin Mary in heaven.
This year’s pilgrimage takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the murder of an older French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who, during the Mass, invaded the church in the north of France and cut his throat.
The murder of Jacques Amel took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators claim to have radicalized him with Jihadist online video material,-- he was struck by a truck at the party of the Basilian Day celebrations in Nice, Riviera, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks over a period of 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists fell dramatically, and the authorities were concerned that this year’s pilgrims could fall rapidly.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say that there has even been an influx of visitors' applications at the last moment.
Some 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including a delegation of large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 Christians in the Eastern branch of the Orthodox.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be afraid.
"We do not intend to stop living," a 66-year-old visitor Christian said to AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It's important to show that life continues," said Matthew Guinear - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about security in France, since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted, including the huge market for preserves in the northern town of Lille and the European Cycling Championship, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to cancel applications," said Fabien Ležesne last weekend, the priest responsible for the official pilgrimage.
"On the contrary, it seems that the attacks have mobilised believers," he said and announced the influx of last-minute applications.
Christian Gel, head of the trade association of local hotel employees, confirmed "increased interest" in pilgrimage after attacks.
There were extremely strict security measures around the holy place where the virgin Mary appeared to the poor shepherd Bernadet Subir in 1858.
Some 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the site, including bomb neutralisation experts and explosive detection dogs experts.
As the pilgrims passed through security barriers, bags were checked at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeast England to Lourdes at the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"Until Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then only one entry through the gates (with metal barriers) was possible, as well as bags were searched," said The Local.
"This whole thing scared my three children, who are used to Lourdes, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why it happened," she said.
It has not damaged my impressions, but it saddened me that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these events.
The Friday opening procession route is also shortened - instead of starting in Lourdes city and moving further to the temple, it will begin and end in the temple.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights over Lourdes, the closure of the streets near the traffic temple and the replacement of waste caves for transparent plastic bags.
Minister of the Interior of France Bernar Kazenev will examine security measures on Saturday.
Some six million people travel to Lourdes each year, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in a cave where Bernadette had seen Mary, believing in the therapeutic properties of water.
Thierry Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as "a little unusual" in view of "the threat that the roots seem to be found in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
François, a 58 - year - old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that she felt that the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if it calms everyone down, it is good.
The Saragoza Trade Centre shoots two wounded

The discovery of the hunting season of waterbirds is approaching.
Every year on the second Saturday of August, the hunting season of waterbirds is opened.
This year it will start at 16:00 on the 13th of August, therefore the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with security regulations.
Waterfowl hunting takes place not only on hunting grounds, but also in public water bodies, and although weather conditions do not promise heat as other years, it is permissible to use these water bodies in conjunction with hunters.
Both hunters and holidaymakers and water bodies are invited to be particularly careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety regulations, thus not endangering themselves or others.
As in previous years it has been observed that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will carry out enhanced hunting control.
During the control, law enforcement officials will pay attention to compliance of arms and ammunition with the norms of the law, as well as will monitor that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and intoxicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrons of patronage and magicianry is prohibited in the hunting of waterbirds, including the amendment of the Law on the Movement of Arms and Special Means, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with tall-bore firearms or large-scale pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sports and during a short stop-over period of up to two hours when these weapons are being transported to or from hunting, shall have the right to hold the weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but they shall be placed in the safest possible place so that the case or other packaging containing the ammunition or weapon shall not be visible from the outside of the vehicle, shall be locked and fitted with an alarm device to ensure that they do not accidentally fall into the hands of unauthorised persons.
The police invite you and your fellow people to take care of their safety during the hunting season and, if you consider offences or a threat to security, we invite you to immediately report by calling 110.
In the event of any threat, law enforcement officers are ready to respond to information provided by citizens.
The coast of New Caledonia is rocked by a 7.2-magnithode earthquake
On Friday’s coast of New Caledonia, a 7.2-magnith earthquake struck, seismologists told us that there was no tsunami threat.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of nine kilometres 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia Ilantera at 1.26 Greeniča time (at 4.26 Latvian time), reported by the U.S. Geology Research Centre.
The Pacific Tsunami alert centre indicated that there are currently no warnings or recommendations in relation to possible Tsunami threats to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region are not unusual, nor are activities recently unusual," said chief seismologist of the Geoscience Australia, Phil Kamins.
This could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt whether it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the circle of Fire - the zone of Pacific tectonic activity, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints at the border between the two countries, which were closed a year ago at the initiative of Venezuela, on Thursday were announced by the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro.
Originally, the border points will only be open to pedestrians.
Five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20 a.m. starting Saturday.
It will be possible to open the border for transport after separate transnational agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, pointed out by the Presidents.
In August last year Maduro ordered the border to be closed in response to an attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were wounded by this attack.
In July of this year Venezuela opened the border twice due to the sharp economic crisis: the Venezuelans in poverty tried to break through the border in order to buy essential goods in the frontier shops.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time is our time for one of the prides of Latvia, for the sympathetic Madara Palmeika.
Madara Palameika was born on 18 June 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian light-sleeve that starts in a plaster-throwing competition.
Her coach is Father Gints Palameik.
The Latvian recordist sniffed in casting.
Participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics, participated in the World and European Championships several times (the 4th place in 2014 European Championship), and won the 3rd place in 2015 Diamond League overall.
Facebook says fight ads to the blockers.
Facebook, the most used social network in the world, has sent a warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and users will have to watch ads in the same way.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are falling.
Facebook has now announced that he understands the irritating nature of banners, but users will have to live with them as well.
However, they will be provided with tools to choose the type of material they are showing, reported by the BBC.
"As we provide more and more control options for people, we will also start to show ads to those who use advertising blocking software," said Andrew Bosvort, Vice President of Facebook advertising business.
In other words, users will be able to choose the type of advertising they see when selecting brands and sectors that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with content enjoying," said Bosvort.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices are usually not working and Facebook receives the largest number of visits, but the reduction in the exposure of banners is also measurable in billions of money.
According to BBC, approximately 200 million people use advertising blocks.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year, Facebook's advertising revenue was USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit the flow of news with "scaling" headings, behind which is actually "empty" news.
At night on Brīvības Street will perform asphalt works; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
Tonight, in the Brīvības street section from Berzaunes street to Gustava Zemgala street, asphalt application works will be carried out, therefore drivers have to take into account limited traffic in this street section.

Informal meeting was held at the fish processing plant "Kaija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs participated in the meeting.
The portal was approved by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting there was talk about the abolition of sanctions for fish processors, as well as about Inčukalns gas storage.
The meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, was held without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organizer of the meeting was Ambassador of Russia Aleksandrs Veshniakovs.
A suspected seizure of more than €130 000 shall be detained by the accounting officer.
This month, the State Police (VP) Office for Combating Economic Crimes (ENAP) informed the BNS representative Gita Gžibovska about the misappropriation of 130 thousand from one of Riga's commercial companies, who had been working for 20 years in the company.
Current information shows that the suspected woman has committed an illegal activity over several years and has caused a total loss to the company of more than €130,000.
In view of the fact that the company’s officials had not closely followed the cash flow and trusted their employee, they only learned about the ongoing machinery after several years.
VP ENAP police this month detained the suspected woman born in 1963 and conducted searches in the company.
Criminal proceedings for seizures, if committed to a large extent, have been initiated in connection with the case.
For such a crime, the law provides for imprisonment for up to ten years, confiscating property or without confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a non-detention security measure.
In Estonia, antibodies against Zika virus have been detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people reported antibodies to the Zika virus in their analyses, which means that they might have been exposed to the infection, as reported by the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year the Zika virus was tested on 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden in countries close to Estonia.
Data from the Estonian Health Administration show that no acute infection of the Zika virus has been recorded in the country and people do not have to carry out a Zika virus test for flu-like symptoms, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have developed IgG (immunoglobulin class G) antibodies that show that the person under test is infected with Zika or similar virus at some time.
"This doesn't mean that the patient has had Zika virus," explained Paul Naber, Head of Synlab's Department of Infectious Diseases.
The zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car procurement, in an interview to the agency BNS said the Vice President of the Auto Association Ingus Rūtiņš.
Whether there are significant problems with dumped prices in the car sector procurement, Rutiņš replied in a positive manner.
Of course.
However, car purchases are different from service purchases, which make it easier to manipulate prices.
In any case, the car has to pay a certain amount as a result of the car, because it has to be bought from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the advertiser is incompetent and does not know how to create high-quality procurement, as a result of which, often without being aware of it, "buy-up".
"Are you very conscious of the procurement being built to get something concrete, and then there are all kinds of wonders," said the Vice President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the winner, but in part of society there is still a misconception about these things.
Now it's very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria have to be established in both cases, and when they have been taken into account and assessed, the decision is nevertheless taken on the basis of the lowest price.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and market-conform.
On the other hand, points do not need to measure anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points do not need to measure fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things.
You have to know the expected life cycle of the car, mileage, etc., then you can just count everything together.
"The question is then only about which of the scenarios the customer is interested?" Rūtiņš explained.
The project manager of the Auto Association, Pēteris Rubulis, noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for both cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from the same example.
We have also brought to the consultation a model of procurement for spare parts, which, unlike the detailed absurdity, was difficult to name.
"The problem is that the buyer very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and demands are simply copied from somewhere," Rubulis said.
Rūtiņš added that the smaller the structure that announces procurement, the bigger the problems.
"Obviously, this is precisely because of the lack of human resources and expertise," said the Vice-President of the Associations.
Latvian Volleyballists are not up to the fight for medals.
The Latvian beach volleyball duet Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš withdrew from the Rio Olympics tournament on Thursday, with the householders Evandra Gonsalveš Oliveir and Pedro Solbergas Salgada in the decisive match.
Our duet won only one victory in three matches and placed the last fourth in sub-group D.
This caused quite a lot of indignation and sorrow on social networks, so we offer to look at the brightest recordings from Twitter.
Riga Festival celebrations have started with the market.
Look at the photo as it looks at the holiday market in Esplanade.
"Die Anthwood" charges "Deathers' Unit" for stealing style.
South African group Die Anthwood accused the director of the film "Sicide Sqaud" ("Suicide Sqaud") of using the unique appearance of the group without permission, calling the respected director "the little deaddaughter".
The group's leading singer Jolandi's mobile app Instagram addressed the director of the film studio Warner Bros, saying, "It's right, David Ajer, you're stealing our style."
As she claims, the movie stars Karas Delavinya and Jared Letto had told him that Air was taunting about the "Die Anthwood" filming field.
"But you didn't ask permission to cheat us," the singer pointed out.
A 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja addressed Aier on this issue, but he "did not answer anything like such a little scared bitch".
Jolandi insists that Aier has taken pictures from the introduction of the 2011 short film "Umshini Wam" showing the South African hipop duet.
She also published a video that seemed to prove that Aier Joker and Harry Quinn had taken their images out of the eyes of both singers.
Letto himself insists that the inspiration of the Joker’s image is the image of rock musician David Bowley.
Jolandi concluded his claim by expressing the harsh assessment of the critics that the film has earned after its premiere.
Jolandi and Ninja, in the right words, Anri du Tuata and Watkins Tudor Jones, gained a reputation with three recordings of the repa studio, promoting African "Zef" counterculture.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey shall seek at least 32 diplomats who, after an attempt to coup on 15 July, did not return with the staff recalled.
On Friday, Foreign Minister Mevits Chavušogls said that 208 employees of the Turkish Ministry were withdrawn from jobs around the world during the coup attempt investigation, and 32 have disappeared "without permission".
About 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, with the government considering them loyal to US official Fetulla Gulen, who it accused of drawing up a government plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is Turkey's most wanted people.
Kavosoglu said that the US Department of Justice team will come to Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The US opposed the Tactics of the strong armor of Turkish President Regjep Tajjip Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey replied by seeking closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that Turkish military attachés had fled to Italy in Greece, that the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia but were returned, and that two Generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one from Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoting military sources, reported that Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was missing.
Wall Street Journal, citing the US official who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based at the NATO Command Center in Virginia has requested asylum in the US.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," said the broadcaster NTV during the Kavosoglu interview.
Since yesterday, time has run out for those who were originally withdrawn.
We will take legal action against those who have not returned.
The organizers of the Olympic Games are trying to clean the green-colored diving pool
The Olympic divers, who were to be trained on Friday, came to a closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean the green water before the first individual race in Rio.
Water suddenly changed color in the middle of the Tuesday, synchronised diving competition.
The organisers claimed that the water race is safe even after the larger adjacent pool for water polo and synchronised swimming also became light green.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes arrived for the morning warm-up, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women's 3 meters race.
The colour of the water looked closer to its normal colour, but still with a green colour.
An American dive named Abby Johnson, who competes on a tramp, told her that she came to the warmup just to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp (find the bog) should be in fashion.
British dive Tom Daley, who won a bronchie in synchronous platform diving, also commented on the status of the pool in the Tweet record.
Hopefully, this means that we have not been nervous in the last few days!
Mario Andrad, the chief speaker of the local committee of organisers, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions, giving the green light to the 3-metre pre-conditions.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of the swimming pool cleaning efforts.
"We repeat again what we have said all the time - water does not in any way threaten the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water again, and that was fully in line with the parameters.
Simon Langford, the chief speaker of the Marija Pole water sports centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world's leading organisation, FINA (International Bathing Federation).
"The reason is that the water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Lengford said in his statement.
Andrad said that the deterioration of the swimming pool surprised the organizers unprepared.
"Chemical is not accurate science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lasted.
In the last few days, getting rainwater in normal condition made it even more difficult.
"The things don't work," Andrad said.
He added that athletes had dry trainings in the morning, but admitted that it was "not perfect."
He explained that the change in the colour of the pool was due to increased levels of alkalin, similar to the water of the aquarium can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something about green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water, because athletes are training in it," said Andrad.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent water from becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports explorers Jay Cohen and Steve Wade took part in the creation of this action in Rio de Janeiro.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication, will hold a forum
Shanghai and Taipei will, however, hold an annual urban forum in Taipei from August 22 to 23, and announced on Friday the municipality of Shanghai, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
High-level municipal official Sha Hailin Shanghai mayor Janga Xiong will lead the delegation represented in the forum, announced by the government of Shanghai in its official microblog account in Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been organised in rotation by both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as healthcare, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "deepen the exchange of experience and cooperation in different aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwanese side has failed to recognise the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the principle of one Chinese since the new leader Tsai Ing-ven took office in May, resulting in the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguangs , a speaker of the Council of State of the Taiwanese Office of Affairs on land, on Friday said that peaceful cross-border relations can exist while the Taiwanese side stops at the political bases of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experience between cities on both sides," said MA, stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and exchange of experience between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vangu Ji, Ugandan President Jover Museveni thanked China for its long-standing development support for Uganda and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China was an ancient friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the release of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Tanzania-Zambi railway in the 1970s as proof of China's generous support, which was provided even when China itself was not particularly prosperous.
Museveni said that China has carried out multilateral cooperation with Uganda, both in terms of investment in infrastructure and entrepreneurship and cultural exchanges, and added that this kind of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply provided financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of an industrial park in various ways.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel around it.
Wang She praised Uganda's industrialisation and agricultural modernisation and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal cooperation partner for Uganda.
Wang stated that China was ready to do its utmost to help implement Uganda's economic and social development and added that China's cooperation with Uganda was genuine and without any political considerations, as it was based on a high level of political credibility and proven friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial park and support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African people.
