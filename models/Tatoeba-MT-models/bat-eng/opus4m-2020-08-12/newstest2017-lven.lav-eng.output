A 28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally began to improve."
The figure found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, said the representative of the Medical Expert Office of the San Francisco Courts.
The San Francisco police said that his death was a murder and that investigations are under way.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia tells the San Francisco broadcasting in ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he was working on his dreams at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
The restaurant "Sons & Daughters" representative informs that the news about his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we will miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we will think with Frank’s friends and family.
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank was at first overnight in the hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia claims he doesn't know who wants to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.
"He always palpated his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to engage in a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"In view of everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.

New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade unions to initiate protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Committee of Young Doctors (JAC) intends to ask the Council to support the wider protests at the beginning of September.
According to JAC, the ministers have not been able to dispel the doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
The Treaty was voted against by 58% of all the Members who took part in the vote.
On Thursday evening, on Twitter, JAC board member Elena McKorta points out that the government continues to keep silent on this issue and that, therefore, the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, as a result of the vote in the JAC, the proposal for a treaty has been rejected in its entirety and a decision has been taken to request new formal discussions to discuss key issues'.
In response to the silence of the government, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the drafting of new agreements, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS history.
Following the vote rejecting the contract terms proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, Dr Johans Malawana, representative of the new doctors of the LMA, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, health secretary Jeremy Hunt informed me that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of Dismisses?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to rock and announce the end of the eight months of the war on economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin congratulated the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg Castle, it seemed that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
Yet, they rocked together.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
On the other hand, the editor Tajjip Erdogan called Putin at least five times his "Dear friend", telling us a review of the meeting.
I'm sick of a number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to conflicting feelings.
However, the cooling from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the crash of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharp.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a rag on Moscow's back.
The deal was even more painful because it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government - controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were responsible.
The most serious accusations were that the Erdogan family had profited from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He, of course, denied it himself.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was just because Putin received President Erdogan's apologies.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from the peace settlement is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after the failed coup last month, where he tried to be cast down.
The countless terrorist attacks have also rocked his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused severe damage, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually provides for the influx of several million Russian tourists each year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies are also relieved by breathing when scheduled flights are renewed.
They look forward to a holiday in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, national TV forecasts a fall in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will resume.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes, "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But there were other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for their weak reaction to the coup attempt.
All of this can also be seen in the dissatisfiedness of the long-standing EU accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the 'rejected alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, both Presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided the issues of disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey hit the Russian fighting aircraft, the situation has improved as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Scottish Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will play a supporting role in the future, notified by the bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations rugby and ending with the Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The smaller private financial brands, such as Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will now also be noted.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees along Invernesshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employees are working with, because now we become more a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its own industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we have asked ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs, we have obviously made great changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think it's the right time now.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th victory, winning first place in the New Market with horse Predition
Detrusors detrusor the champagne by winning their 3,000th victory twice to finish the first race in the New Market.
Friday juckey Franky Detori won his 3,000th victory in British history, gaining first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in this race, which took place in his home city, riding with Predition, trained by John Gosden.
The 45 - year - old Italian is the sixth jockey who has achieved this result in the horse sprint race.
He's joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edder and Willy Carson.
The triple champion jockey Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very touched because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York City, because I've been here for 30 years.
It's not a big race, it's not King Ascott, it's an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predition are welcome with tears and gems.
Two jockeys have reached this record in a race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the 20-time final champion Sir Antonio McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4300 wins.
Lester Pigot, a nine-fold dermian winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today’s best jockeys and it’s no surprise that he has made progress that few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactic distinguishes him from other juckeys.
He is a fantastic racer, his enthusiasm and charisma years attract fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago, at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he had already won 6,000 wins if he didn't just take part in weekends and big races.
Seriously, though, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He's a happy man who's good at the British race, and he's a great jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand - flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of the British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventure road.
He has won countless large races, including the famous 1996 "Grand Seven" in Ascott, and has also survived an aircraft crash and disqualification of the use of preparations.
Three years ago he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detori has previously said that he would be happy to continue participating in the race until at least 50 years of age.
President Putin dismisses the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov
President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been among Putin’s closest ones for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the office of Head of the Russian President's Administration", without mentioning the reason.
In place of Ivanova, Anton Vaino has been appointed as his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Kaino has been a diplomat.
Kaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
As reported by the Kremlin's website (in Russian), later he led the President's minutes and government staff management.
After being appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post and recommended that Vyno be his alternate.
Does the smile convince you?
This step has embarrassed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a state television session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cameras, rarely this explanation convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that a man who was considered to be a potential president suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russian environmental policy is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult position, one could even say, a problematic position, four years.
It turns out I've been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, in the same way as Putin.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov held the office of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the position of President of Russia, because the re-election of Putin for the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then another close associate of Putin - Dmitri Medvedev - became president.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to office three and a half years later.
The Sophistication of Fish in a Garden in the City of Banf
A man from Banfas asks for help to find out what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banfas.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels that have removed with a water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 150 feet [500 m] from the sea, published a video of fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these five-centimeter fish came to his garden.
Quinsphere intersection: The bridge is now connected to the Faif.
Currently, GBP 1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere cross and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The bridge is constructed 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Kate Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel were used in the construction of these parts.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of the Fourth Bridge Connection, says: "The first bridge is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to the part of the land, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct of the northern entrance to the south 700 mm [700 mm] south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Huge because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to pull about 3 percent.
Delicious because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything worked well.
Simon Bailes acquires gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bailes, that's not all about it.
Dynamic leaps.
Effortlessly carries out exercises on the beam.
Unexceedable on the floor.
Perfectly perfect.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnastic won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to that of Alija Raismane, a silver medal winner and her teammate, and Alija Mustafin, a Russian sportsman who won bronze medal.
On Thursday, American sportsman Simon Bailes performed training on the individual finals of the race sport for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Fear became the fourth American in a row, who won the title of a multi-fighter champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she broke out in tears, because the long way to this point was over.
This achievement ranks him next to unparalleled athletes such as Michael Pellp, who raised his sport to a different level.
For the last three years, Bailes has dominated her sport by obtaining 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, with such excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that in 1984, Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called her "the best gymnast she has ever seen".
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with her hopes, not with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
The US athletes Simon Bailes (left) and Alija Raismane hug after winning the gold and silver medal at the individual multi-fight finals for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailes on Tuesday, making a special random coordinator Marta Karolji's farewell party.
Although Bailes claims that she did not expect such a thing in her long way to the top of glory, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movements, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by the mother of the coach Amy Bourman on a tour to the gym where the Bourman terns were held has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost her race since the summer of 2013 and the winnings series can continue as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafin’s two rotations had a little leadership, it was just an illusion.
Balance log and free movement - part of the race, where Bailes will defend his champion title, is still in front.
She came forward with a score of 15,433 on the log and strengthened the control with a score of 15,933 in free movements
Raismane gently embraced her while waiting for the results, which were only formality and she broke out in tears of joy when the dream she had once written in her notebook was fulfilled.
The result of Raismāne was a little revenge over four years ago, when she divided the third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, who is called "mammal" by the Americans, came up with a convincing leadership.
After her performance in free movements, which dispelled her doubts about her return, she could devote herself to a crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, the 19 - year - old Bailesa’s viral Twitter recording r, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahai Brown's "string-blow" survives a fire in Philadelphia.
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that he was already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The children’s grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in a girdle, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was still unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells the television: "His little body was just bitten by bullets."
I can't believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in a critical state and has already undergone several operations.
The family tells us that he will certainly recover.
He had to start in the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the city of Germantown.
Three men were shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
The CBS Philadelphia channel reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical position, while the other two victims are in a stable position.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the victim of the age of 29 in a critical state.
The two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The investigator told the CBS Philadelphia channel that a number of shooters were likely involved.
At the scene, gun cartridge shells belonging to different weapons were found.
It looks like it has been a long fire.
Shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian side.
"Until then, it looks like there were several armed shooters here who were actively involved in the shooting," says Antonio Ginaldi, the captain of the Philadelphia Police.
Some homes and cars are also damaged.
No one has yet been arrested and it is reported that police are checking camera records.
On Tuesday, a lost bullet hit a 6 - year - old girl in her hand while playing with her house in the Vestouklein district.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Women's Olympic Lightweight Team for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three athletes, Simon Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an African American.
Last year Simona and Gabija took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the Olympic champion by surprise, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises by the three-way champions Simon Bailes, Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row who has won a gold medal in an individual battle for women.
Her teammate, Alija Raismane, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country, the situation during the gymnastics is completely different.
Simona, Gabija, and Lauria entered the Olympics in the same way as Alija and Madison.
They're "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Carola's work.
In fact, gymnastics is expensive sport. Gymnastics are mainly trained in private athletics clubs, and they are supported by parents who pay for training, premises, travel, uniforms, hotels (trenders, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these amateur clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs athletes take off all their trainings, and this is a costly and long investment for families of athletes.
Amy Burman - Simon Bailes' coach and Maggie Hainya - Lauria Hernandez's coach has been training their athletes since both girls started to engage in athletics.
We have to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabija and Lauria with cheaper training opportunities.
I founded my Lens Organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) trainings free of charge or at low cost. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open the branch office in Detroit, my home city, to provide local young people with an opportunity to get acquainted with this wonderful sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in amateurs and it is fantastic.
Working with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for their excellent demonstration of the Girls Force, acquiring the gold medals of the Olympic Games and encouraging countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s offer has been rejected, young doctors plan to increase their strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on the amendment of the agreement with the British Medical Association. However, 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced its plans to conclude a contract, stating that NHS is in a fragile situation and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract providing for changes to the conditions for night work and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Elena Makourta, the representative of BMA, stated that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide equal treatment for all doctors.
Eight weeks remain before the first group of young doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with total silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt said that his doors were always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine surgerys and 100,000 visits were carried out at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on the amendment of the agreement with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the week-end work rate for 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, Chief Executive Officer of NHS, urged young doctors not to go on strikes.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the busy workers and worry, create stress and obstacles for patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking to the new Committee of Doctors for the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as staff placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, study leaving and gender pay inequalities in medicine - shows that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
A daily dose of 2 pounds may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the medicine for 2 pounds per day, since official representatives recommend that it be used more in humans and for a longer period of time.
Anticoagulation medicines Ticagrel reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of a new heart attack.
It is recommended that NHS-represented NICE be used 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that NHS-owned NICE be used 4 years after heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack, and a quarter of them suffer a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart walls, causing obstructions.
If the obstruction breaks, it can cause a clot, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing heart attack.
In turn, if a clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the blood from reaching the brain, leading to a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a heart attack again.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, UK, and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor 90 mg be used in humans for 12 months and 60 mg twice daily for another 3 years with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of Health Technologies at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent a recurrent heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative effect on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and infarction in people who have experienced it before.
When we recommend treatment with Ticagrelor provisionally, we are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
A culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, Lutfur Rahman, former Mayor of the City of Tayerhamleta, was dismissed from office in relation to corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness brings large-scale fraud to Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Erik Picl criticises the police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "the fear of harming ethnic and religious interests."
The former Secretary of Communities, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at electoral stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present their identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
He even recommended that the voters' fingers be marked with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He felt that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by informal committees and working parties.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by the Dauningstritis following the scandal in connection with the Tayerhamlet City elections.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to remove the Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by indicting them in racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the idea that the religious duty of Muslim believers is to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted on several occasions.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying to have postal fraud, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a personal identification document, in order to establish the identity of the person.
His report states: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for senior candidates selected by the community, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that regional authorities are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be harmed."
Sir Ēriks outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with the votes cast by post in order to prevent "voting".
The report, which is being examined by Teresa Maya, also calls for a more thorough check on registration in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider requiring voters to present their identity document before voting.
Marking the voters' fingers with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Establish a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaign participants and activists from voting through postal and electoral envelopes for postal voting.
Provide the police with the mandate to deploy a guard to the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photographing in polling stations.
To require the use of English only in polling stations (except Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that voters go to the election stations one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolis police in his misunderstood that there is no charge in the Towerhamlett case.
He says: "The delay was only disqualified by the court by Luftura Rahman and his representative for corruption and fraud-related activities."
He was found to be guilty of a standard of proof of criminal law on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient "checking" of the voters of the city council in the voter registration districts.
Sir Eriks points out: "Last year's court decision is an alarm call.
Our land is known as Parliament's homeland, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretending by the institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Engagement with a cyclists - Kate's accomplice and other Rio Olympic celebrities
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are delighted about the French cyclists Paulina Ferrand Prevot, whom the fans have recognized as extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, a 24 - year - old cyclists is not the only sportsman who fights this summer for gold, which, according to the media, is proud of her famous companion.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of participants in the Olympic Games, which is quite similar to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolverine: Brother Brady Elison, a member of the U.S. circle shooter team, has been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio on the left since childhood
Apart from Kate’s companion on a cycling track, many people on the Internet point out that this bearer could be the twin brother of the superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio.
Brady Elison, a member of the U.S. team of men shooters, caused a storm on the Twitter when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
He also noticed the storm in social media and admitted that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see a big similarity except beard," Brady tells Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular peers in the 2012 London Olympics will certainly gain even greater popularity: the striking similarity between British remoter Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
Thanks to her big, expressive eyes, Russia’s light-weightist Alija Mustafin is compared to the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
In terms of swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgs has been compared for several years with "Create stage" star Matthew Morrison.
Change: This user has noticed that Nathan is a sporty version of the film "Inception" actor.
Similarly, ancient associates include the tennis star Raphael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalin McCorde can be proud not only of sun-tanned skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that American athletes Nathan Adrian are like Joseph Gordon Levite.
Swim women: Football star (left) Hope Solo and Dexters actress Jennifer Karpentere (right) have a similar face form and eyes.
There is no one: What kind of Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see these similarities too
Theory: this user considers that there is probably a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user said with real pleasure that "other Internet users agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Karpentere actually look identical."
The US football star and the actress of the series "Dexters" really have a very similar face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons refer to Curie Walts Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of Laura Linnija. Gami Douglas, who won gold medals, is also proud of a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the smile of the "Bring It On" star Gabriela Uniona.
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologises for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is 'completed like a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish fourth place in 4x200 m free-style staff for women, called indignation storm for CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentaries commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race had "flyed out of the race that stinked alone" and "comes out like a pig".
Commentator Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m of free-style staf for women at the end of the finals presented their personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentator team to give comments vitality, said: "The little 14-year-old from China is unable to keep up with him."
"Too much, she ran out of the race, that she was stinking alone and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan in the second stage was 1:57.79, that is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers throughout Canada reacted promptly on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmet McFarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did a direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig"???"
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the direct air.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m free-style final for women was named "the little 14-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism against Bairon McDonald quickly became effective because many requested explanations.
Twitter users were unable to believe when they heard the insensitive comments of Bairona McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and for you we all sound like racists.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who was at the time conducting the CBC live broadcast, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologise for the comment on the bathing result on the direct air."
It was a failed choice of words and we regret it.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to Twitter for this comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret the fact that these comments were made and that they came into direct contact.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and we apologised to all live viewers and followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon's comments were made on the performance of the swimmer and not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case non-professional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Bairon deeply regretted what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized to the direct air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
In the live broadcast of the CBC Olympic Games, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's free-style competitions."
I'm talking about a swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean to show disrespect, and I really regret it.
Primark's buyers are shocked by a woman who has tossed in the middle of the underwear store.
The shoppers were uncomfortable when the woman started to dress up to put her panties in the middle of the store.
As the situation got worse, she leaned on them to make sure they fit her and then pulled them off by putting the panties back on the shelf of the store.
She continued to look for clothes in the Bolkestone Bouverie Place shopping center store and used four more panties.
Primer shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – a place where this woman kept her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, was also in the store.
She points out that people were unable to believe their eyes.
When she was standing in the middle of the store, she took her underwear from her shelf, took off her tights and pants, and put them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to scan them, she just held them right there.
Everyone was watching her pull off her panties and apparently she didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She put on three more panties until she decided she didn't like any of them and left the store.
It did not seem to worry that someone was watching or thinking about someone who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Miss Davidsson (33 years) from Kent says: "It is a good idea that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by another person and that have not been washed out afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidsone adds: "I assume that after she left the shop, the shop staff removed the above clothes from the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has used it and hasn’t washed it afterwards.
The representative of Primark pointed out that Primark was known for the incident which took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves close to the distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to the Krav Maga Master from New York Ron Mizrake.
Whether you're attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
When an attacker strikes from the back, the fiery indicates that it must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the path of a shot.
Then the weapon should be grasped between your front arm and shoulder and strike the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then there's a hit with the knee in the girdle and while the attacker freezes in pain, take the gun away, put the gun in his face with the October of the weapon and step back, continuing to target the weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar - to avoid the path of the shot, to capture the weapon and to bend it so that the evildoer cannot shoot.
At the same time, press the weapon and hit the opponent’s chest and finally remove the weapon and resign by continuing to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraci does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Magna's master, it's safer to give your money to the robber.
The water family is demolishing the social home of Saltash Cornwall and is placed on the street.
The vandal family has been displaced from their homes for terrorising neighbours, causing damage to the social home of 50 000 pounds.
Tanya Skeldona and her partner, Shon Trebilkoc, are just from the property in the Cold Cornwall because several complaints have been made about them.
When they were forced out of property, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was dumped everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now set aside and is likely to live in private property.
Donna Makevoya, the manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there are concerns that housing will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and that she believes that people cannot live like this.
In this case, several factors have to be assessed, since in the future this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were regularly in possession and the police said that their terror was violence, street breakup with baseball batons, intimidation of the local population, drug use, drug sales, and loud blasphemy and blasphemy.
In June, 47-year-old Skeledon, whose name was property, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour.
A number of demolished rooms found dumped waste.
In a home where previously traded drugs can be traded, there are also several floors.
The neighbors say that they have regularly fought on the street and are constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of property when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house on a voluntary basis.
Disappointed neighbors were very happy about the eviction because their life was an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents."
We lived near them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's incredible how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We wake up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the neighbourhood protection of the Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here is regularly called the police.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the home garden.
He also said: "It is a pity that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to watch.
I appreciate the work of my whole team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the commune who were courageous and worked with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and will show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
An unclean mattress that remained on the floor of one of the rooms after setting up.
Service workers will now have to clean up a pile of waste left behind in the house.
In 2014, the police house was searched and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
The Skeleton has only been found to be responsible for the storage of Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they currently rent a private property in Plimut.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house.
The police tell us that they will continue to evict tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Krov, spokesman for Devon and Cornwall, points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they wish and have no consequences."
The police in Devon and Kronvola do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The readiness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The Mayor of Cannes banned the burkin's swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the French southern resort town of Cannes has banned the use of burkini swimsuits on its beaches, which almost completely cover the woman’s body and closely resemble the hydrowear, announced on Thursday by local officials.
The Mayor of Cannes David Linar has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal's dress, which externally shows religious belongings at a time when France and places of worship are the object of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of public order disruption (crowding, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented," says the order.
"We are talking not about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outer clothing related to trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting against us", explained the municipal service manager of the municipality Thierry Miguls.
He added that the Burkini swimsuits on the Cannes beaches had not been seen since July 28, when the right-wing member of the Central Party "Republikans" Linar signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the Aquapark in Marseille abolished a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed in burkins in their swimsuits because the indignation about such an event was expressed by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France, the wearing of face-covering Muslim women's headgear is prohibited, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist in Nice, a resort town close to Cannes, under the responsibility of the Islamic State Group.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn confidence in the Islamic State brutally murdered the priests in the church in northwest France.

The management report says that last year the company reconstructed the existing shop in Riga, Slokas Street and closed the shop in Riga, Kurzemes Prospectus.
This year, like next year, the company's main task is to continue increasing both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended to leave the profits made last year undistributed.
"Jysk" is an international network of shops offering goods for home improvement.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The company's share capital is EUR 3 500 264.

The "Cuban" festival has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, on the evening of Lucavsala, one of the last festivals of this summer was given - there will be "Cuban" until Sunday night.
On the first night, groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which were expected last year but were missing from the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, the programme features famous words - Guano Apes and Garbage, the drummer of the pancrac legend Ramones, Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, Brutto & Lyapis with the leading Belarusian pancrac in Sergey Mihalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, the Ukrainians Vopli Vidoplyasova and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it was a financial failure and a huge loss, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsal - they added a long character to the name, included a Latvian group in the program ( Friday evening 19:15 on stage "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and acquired a local color next to the symbols of Riga, such as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts are justified is too early to judge, because the festival is just running away, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed on the first night, at least for the moment huge crowds of people have not been attracted, and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British Track Cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.

The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in their qualification, but the first round of the competition was readjusted by the New Zealanders.

The final team of Great Britain won with a score of 42,440 seconds, winning the New Zealanders by 0,102 seconds.
In the fight for bronchi, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of the female embodiment journey - the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President, who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgall - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years old, since the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgale was born.
Zemgale uttered the state of Latvia, but it has been undeservedly preserved in the shadow of the first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
None of our other statesmen have defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale wrote in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgale ten years ago, Arnolds Auziņš.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzins emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The other ones are so stiff, they're always very right.
He taught not to be, today it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was close to the people," says Auzins.
Modern politicians know bad history, they referred to Kārlis Ulmanis as the good leader, but rarely anyone knows how disgusting he was.
The only person on whom he was not screaming in government sittings was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he was kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"The Zemgale, with his sense of humor and democracy, has exactly the opposite impression," says Auzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in conversation with Delfi agrees with Auziņš' assessment of Zemgale as a peaceful and balanced stateman.
He also noted that Zemgale had respected minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
"At that time, this was not a common practice, after Zemgale's Presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighed man who had to be told to become president for a long time.
He didn't want it himself, just didn't want it.
He also regarded himself quite critically because he did not know French, but he felt that the President should certainly understand it.
"During the President's term, the fundamentals of the French language were learned," explained Stranga.
Zemgale did not allow him to be reprimanded to stand, but he did not like that high office.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before entering the President's Palace he was in a serious position - he was a very demanded notary.
Zemgale also led the famous Zemgale box office on Suvorova Street 3, where there was a society of storekeepers and collector publishers, in which practically the state of Latvia was formed during the government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
There was not a big fan of Ulmanis, but he was not publicly opposed either.
"In private negotiations, however, sometimes it has been said that the real actions of Ulmanis do not embarrass him," says Stranga.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember today?
Unfortunately, for a large part he is associated with just a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his beliefs were central.
"There were no major shocks during his time, i.e. he could associate with such a real stable Presidency," Stranga summarises.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgale, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's state visit to Sweden was also held, which during that time implied full recognition for Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the Nordic family of democratic nations.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often face a child’s anger, anger, and anger that parents view as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, Econet says psychologist Jekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger, which each of us experiences periodically.
Aggression is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can do so with anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), enter the shower, put it on the table and do other things we don't usually do.
We do not turn our attention to others because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
When they get angry, children do not understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!" "You're a fool", "Bad Mom", "I don't hate you", "I won't make friends with you" and very rarely when you can say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live literally, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly expressing their feelings, and often they are also caught up in various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent a child from expressing feelings, including anger, from being ashamed of it and not looking at it, but, on the contrary, helping the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long working day in which everything hasn't been going the way you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to "disconnect" from all over the world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Can you give a moment to the relationship and breathe a little?
Does this indicate, however, that each partner has his own path?
In their opinions, gentlemen are divided into different age groups.
John (23) is brief and concise: "In my view, if you need a break in a relationship, don't be with the right man."
In the meantime, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little thing, then it's definitely the right time to explore other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or think about him in particular, or even don't want to see him again.
So the answer is, yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, you have to break each other's daily relationships, because if you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week with someone, then the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to get tired of each other, especially if there is nothing to talk about anymore, just what you have done in the day.
My personal experience makes me think that way, so I've never had a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that it is better elsewhere or someone else - then why does this woman you are with deserve someone who can think that here is not good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so a little condemn those who do not." says Edmunds (46).
Carl (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment to breathe.
You can't watch each other in the morning to the evening and enjoy the eternal love.
Get out of here!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
It's all time.
Of course, if a friend or wife knows how to balance family life with the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the tomb.
That's it.
Mārtiņš (27) says, "It's hard to say, it's necessary or not, it's possible or it's not possible to take a break, but one thing is clear: there's nothing in its proposed relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is raised, then it must be taken into account that there will be some change in the near future - either on the right or on the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, you need to wait -- all the time, but when everything gets serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, there's no talk about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society now and once need to breathe, then what will happen when you're retired, who will comment on how passing cats die or argue about what day the garden should be better ripped," Kristaps (19) explains.
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.
With its exciting and exciting personality, Rozentāls was the first to stimulate interest of the Latvian people in the performing arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable," Roman Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening the old master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art, with its extensive retrospect in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, honors painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose 100th birthday on the international scale is included in the UNESCO holiday calendar.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the main events of Janis Rozentāls' annual programme.
The selection of works of art is mainly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activity, stylistic changes and different techniques.
In addition, exhibits were used from Aksele Gallena-Kallela Museum, Writing and Music Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the connection of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter for his own creative purposes with his own camera.
The Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art at the same time offers small informational exhibitions "With a Look in Finland, With a Heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the "Virk" gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.
Matt Leblanck is looking forward to returning to the "TopGear" show.
Met Leblanck, director of the television broadcast "TopGear" ("Gas on the floor!"), said he was looking forward to returning the car show in the second season, but admitted that he did not know what future awaits him.
So far, nothing officially happens.
"If it is, it will be announced by BBC," Leblank revealed in his conversation with TV critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas in the Floor!" arose in July when Leblanck's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the program.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblank and "Gas in the floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans described the star of "Friends" of the former series ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thus eliminating rumors that the friendship of both during the filming is broken.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most in the show, he replied that travel to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The TV BBC states that the show does not yet plan to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

It is expected that the meldonium contained in the medicinal product Mildronate manufactured in Latvia could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this Friday morning, the director of Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician Ivars Kalvins said in the LNT broadcast 900 seconds.
He told me that he would go to Canada in September to discuss the matter of melody with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Millronate would be removed from the black list already this year.

In 1989, the man was born to fall on 1905 street and was taken to medical care.
In the municipality of Dobele, in the municipality of Naudītes, in 1989 a motorcyclist tried to avoid the dog who ran on the road and turned over.
He's in the hospital, too.

However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The business scenes of the U.S. models in his interpretation have gained the flattery of a sophisticated photo session and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative work that balances the complexity and banal vulgarity, with hard-to-draw borderlines between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product area.
The film with Vigo Mortensen underscores the question whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from consumer society's fragility and values) bring blessings or destruction to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and the real values after his wife’s death.
A moving, smart film by Met Ross this year won the Cannes Festival Award for her directorship.
Of course, sharks do it as if they were attacking beautiful girls - it was a swimmer in Joks, in this case a brave surfer represented by Blake Livley.
The job asked for her great heroism.
This survival solo can be compared with James Franco's activist demonstration in 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds' game in the movie Acquitted alive.
Perhaps there is also the main role of the performer Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the sample to the example of a creative resident and the almost family-valuer seem to be only a fiction of a quite desperate Hollywood script.
Islamic state in Syria has destroyed 2000 civilians.
Other information: Has engaged in acts that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, including acts that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Gerabulus," said the press representative of the Kurd Menbige Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurds-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-supported Kurd-Arab alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza was released from the Jihadist.
The Islamic country took Menbyza in 2014.
As early as last week, the QSD pushed most of the ISIS fighters from Menija, but some held up and demonstrated fierce resistance.
However, on Friday, they left the city taking prisoners with them.
Islamics go to Jerobolus, which is on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), based in London, has also reported that the Islamic State has robbed about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists had hijacked the city's population's cars, forced people into them, and then took them to Gerabulus.
Islamic national fighters have also committed mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, from the region of Deir ez Zora in the east of Syria.
In time, Islamists released about 270 prisoners.
There are no known numbers of Islamic country fighters who have fled from Menija.
A representative of the Kurda Menbiya Military Council reported that QSD has managed to rescue 2,500 people detained by Islamists in Menbiya.

Koļegova refuses to stand as the head of the SRS.
Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his nomination for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), and LETA informed the Agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Koļegova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition.
The real reasons for the discussions seem to be about the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"It's not acceptable to me, too," stresses already the candidate for the position of head of the SRS.
If her candidacy were approved by the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow to fully work and implement the necessary changes to the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full work would not be possible, and Koolegova concludes.
"I have stressed to the public that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now the whole process of my candidate is too politicised," the official explains.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, it is an experience that I value as a benefit", writes Koļegova in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
On Wednesday, Unity stated that during the meeting with Koļegovs "significant contradictions" between the applicant's explanations and the information available in public registers about the dividends costs of SIA Pallogs were revealed, because publicly available Pallogs' decisions of the meeting of participants provide for no profit distribution.
Currently, Deputy Director General Dace Pelėka is the head of the SRS.
In Livani, the police are involved in rescue of two small children left without supervision, informs the State Police Latgale Region Administration.
Information about unattended wheelchairs with infants was received on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were in Livani at the building of the former store.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to help the doctors.
There was also a bag with documents and a mobile phone left in the cart.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers clarified the possible location of children’s parents and went there.
When the women arrived at the civilian man’s home, the police found that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of alcohol.
According to the initial information on the evening of the previous day, the woman born in 1992 visited a friend who had been drinking alcohol.
When she was going home after having a joint seat, she decided to leave her children at the shop under circumstances that had yet to be clarified.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (NRC) regarding the project Infrastructure development for the transfer of port activities from the city centre to the Russian island, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned for the next board meeting of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations according to the opinion of the State Audit Office, when preparing the documents necessary for implementation of recommendations, Riga Freeport Authority was also led by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Riga Freeport Authority and the recommendations provided for improvement of project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the State Audit Office on the feasibility of implementing the project of the Russian island, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider – the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned within the framework of the project have been completed in full within the time limits and in the amount planned.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and also the stevedorings that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding project management and monitoring issues in full," says Sanita Cairo, project manager of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the project objective was supplemented by the main planned activities of the parties concerned and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, monitoring tools for the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening control of the time limits of activities of other parties involved in the project.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining project management areas and identifying developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure has been developed that reflects the planned structure of the project management team, qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the interested parties, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, principles, forms and periodicity of the exchange of information for the successful completion of the project.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary to further justify the need for a service contract or the launch of a procurement and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, a port infrastructure meeting world standards has been built in the Russian island – four new deep-water berths, rail links, as well as engineering communications.
The construction works co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation by the end of the last year, with savings of EUR 10.6 million for the funding allocated to it.
Security at airports has been enhanced in Slovakia as a result of threats.
Following the receipt of a non-specific threat, Slovakia increased security measures at several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," the news agency AFP was informed by a press representative of the Slovak Ministry of the Interior on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the participation of all members of the block except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the former East German border under the Communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain unsolved.
According to data released by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with western allied zones and later in West Germany, the Communist authorities killed 1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled area.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and has been adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including the inclusion of a six-year-old boy among the victims, who drowned when the family tried to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet deserters.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," says Aleksandra Hildebrante, Director of the Museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape the state controlled by the Communists are cared for and disappeared", stressed Hildebrante's statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is unconvincing," says Johen State, an expert in the history of East Germany at the Berlin Free University, in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Berlin Free University are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and until now they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that 138 people had been killed by Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
In view of those people who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not linked to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age died from a heart attack after the border control," says Hildebrante.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction should be made between older people who may have died as a result of their experiences and those who die as a result of prolonged waiting on a bus during hot hours at the border.
Regardless of this, it is not easy to record victims, since the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to produce documents in various scattered archives, according to the State.
However, the State Party has recently produced new documents and could therefore present a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
President of LPF Mr. Rio went to Rio with the coach accreditation; it's a surprise for himself.
In recent days, Kaspars, President of the Latvian Bathing Federation (LPF), who has gained a sad reputation, has arrived at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics with the accreditation of the coach, but is surprised by this.
On Wednesday, there was a great deal of arid after the words of the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Jakubowski, who discovered that he had decided to go to Rio de Janeiro last minute while the trainer had to stay home.
Originally, swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the President of the Federation, Mr.
The Latvian Bathing Federation applied for the Olympic Games five participants, and even before the departure Aldon Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans would be and are looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not present," said Mr, saying that this did not affect the result of Ribakov.
At the Federation's request, Uvy's coach took care of her.
Mr, who himself is a member of the LOC Executive Committee, strongly criticised the operation of the LOC to blame the Olympic sports monitoring body.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to take one of them.
"I don't know why there was not enough room for the Bathing Federation," Mr President said that the work of the Federation and their presidents was underestimated in society, reminding us that the presidents of the Federation are not receiving salaries.
Mr Jakubowski himself also criticised, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. Couldn't tell you why he was in the Olympics with the coach's accreditation, which was probably supposed to come to Yakubowski.
"I was declared President of the Federation "team leader", but for unknown reasons I received coach accreditation and now I am nowhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last minute, I thought German would be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakova started, she had a face-to-face conversation with Ponis and a swimmer with tears in her eyes, however, the President of LPF said that it was a daily conversation with a desire to feel the athletes before the start.
Mr President recalled that the LPF oversees five sports that are part of the Olympic programme, and four of them also provide training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation stated that it is also very important for Latvia to discuss the issues of dripping, and he also talked about such programmes, while he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the Federation's work and said that in 2018 the World Cup could take place in Latvia.
Location in Rio is not my vacation, I work here, I spend my time and I try to run four-year programmes.
There will be 600 000 salmon juveniles in the Daugava.
During Latvenergo AS fish stock recovery program this week in Daugava near Mangalsala there is going to be a drop in salmon and thongs, and this year it is planned to let more than 600 000 annual salmon and thongs grown in fish farms of the scientific institutes Bior Tomes and Dole.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that the fish injection will continue for the following months: 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin each year.
In spring and early summer 2016, pikes and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - sigas, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zanders and vimbs.
The production director of Latvenergo Maris Kuņickis told that the concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"Every activity in measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the production and introduction of juvenile fish in the Daugava basin and other activities," said Kuņickis.
This year more than 600 000 annual salmon and thongs will be introduced into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year before laying, the young fish are marked by cutting off the fat.
Today's cargo has 25 000 droplets with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the scientifically justified composition and number of species in the Daugava and its swimming pool water bodies, the inflow of juveniles and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and its water bodies is carried out by Bior in accordance with regulatory enactments, based on Latvenergo's economic activity loss assessment of fish resources and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environment Service, on the basis of the above expertise, takes a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo's annual compensation amount in the fish stock recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In spring 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We Fish", places 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Izkšķile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish stock recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in a water reservoir is an important measure that promotes the protection and multiplication of fish resources in the Daugava.
The concert hall of the festival "Sansusīs konkursālā" has a farm yard, a forest, a circular.
Sleep in the tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk in cedars and listen to the investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet nature of peace - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which is inviting to Aknīste district for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former parish house of Susēja - no longer existing villages, near forests and curls.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine the careless subtle pleasure of nature and academic music.
Here the theatre and contemporary circus encounter music, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new audiences in an open and open environment without the stringency of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and lightness in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusī can only be captured by spending all three days in it", invites the festival's initiator and host, operabaritone Armands Siliņš.
We open the festival gate on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be software with all the information on the site.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday because it is the most saturated - from 9 a.m. to the next dawn.
"Artists' names are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", told by Armands Siliņš.
There are, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trompetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quarteti Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and actress Anci Strazds has created a contemporary circus show Confines on the artist's inner struggle.
Special works have also been created for the festival.
After F. Kafka, Oļesjs Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nīmanis, an entomologist (a student of bribes) will participate together with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors.
Oskars Herliņš has written the first String Quartet, while Anna Ķirse - Wooden Opera, performance, whose main characters in Andrs Kalnozols' directorship with Katrīna Neiburga's video projects and Andris Eglītis's stage design will be trees in three small clusters in a three-hectare kite.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņas, Dinara Rudāne and Zigmars Graša, they will end up in romantic relationships, just as in a study by Swedish science scientist Karl Linnejs of the Enlightenment (1729).
The Rio Olympic Games today start with one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation’s seven-fighter Laura Ikauvė-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the race in the 100-metre barrier race at 15:35 after Latvian time, but at 16:50 competition is expected in high jumping.
Already at night for Saturday at 2.35, the ball will start to get tough, while at 4.05 - 200 meters sprint will begin.
The seventh race will be concluded on Saturday, when a long jump, weeping and a 800-metre race will take place.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the Bronze World Championship last year, was named the applicant for the Olympic medals.
In May Latvian set a new state record (6622 points) and won the second place in the prestigious seven-fight competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also took part in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with the Latvian record again.
During the last year and a half, the athletes have corrected the state record four times.
Today at 16:00 a.m. the start is also for the Latvian Jūdo martial arts Arthur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, and in the first round he has fought with Azerbaijani sportsman Ušangi Kukauri.
For Judys, this will be the first Olympics in his career.
LETA already announced that on Thursday in weight category up to 100 kilograms lost already in the first fight of Latvia Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He gave way to the Japanese Hagg Rynoski, who later acquired bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelionys brought Latvia the Olympic bronze award, but during the next four Olympic Games, the Judaists of Latvia won only one victory in seven fights, which was performed in London in Borodavko.
At 16.30 a.m. Latvian-time qualification competition will begin with Dainis Upelnieks, but the selection will end on Saturday.
He received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he discovered to the agency LETA that he had been quite sure about driving since April.
The sportsman arrived at the Olympic scene as one of the first athletes in Latvia, trying to make the most of training opportunities in the shooting machine.
At 19.05, the end of the three trips will take place by the 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes for the windboards in the RS:X class.
After three days, or nine trips, Birzule is currently in the 25th place in the overall rating of 26 athletes.
On Saturday will be the decisive final trip for medals.
Today the competition for academic rowing is also scheduled to take place, where the Latvian Latvian representing Ireland, Sanita Pušpure, should participate.
On Wednesday, the race was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Pušpure will compete in C/D semi-finals for single ladies fighting for 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday's quarter final trip, she won fourth place, from the third position, which would allow the fight for the medal to continue, falling behind in 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure won the 13th place four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be divided into Olympics - archery, athletics, track cycling, riding, lifting, trampling, jedo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reids claims that if Clinton is elected to the office of President, she will appoint Garlandas as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reed, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will nominate Merika Garlandas as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The party of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
The leader of the Senate’s majority Mitch Maconnel announced that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonina Scala.
On Thursday, during his conference, Raid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reida's representative later announced that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "screw the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the US District Appeal Court of Colombia.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking the Garland nomination are "integrals" and act in the interest of the President of the Republicn Party candidate Donald Trampa.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the work of the president.
Therape announces the leftover calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar of Pirrell in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Music calendar it is planned to demonstrate new super models, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Steve Shaw, president of the magazine, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a male magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In the press release on calendar creation, Shaws tells us: "We need to go back to images of undeteriorated and classic nakedness, where women's body does not embarrass, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can be sent to your photo electronically or personally during the sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In Rebate the buyer, trying a motorcycle, limps.
At 10 a.m., a motorbike "Yamaha YZ250", stolen from the courtyard of one of the houses in Rembates municipality, which has not been registered, informs the State Police.
The owner of the motorcycle wanted to sell the vehicle through the preaching work.
At the agreed time, the potential buyer arrived, climbed on the motorcycle as if he tried it and left.
The employees of the Ogres police station of the Riga State Police administration ask to refer to anyone who can provide any information useful for investigation in connection with the criminal offence.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video view
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life span from all vertebrates to our planet.
Shark explorer Julius Neilsen says that the record of long life belongs to a mother, who could be between 272 and 512 years old and five feet [5 m] long.
The French court rejects the request for shops to be dismantled in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court dismissed the claim made by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of self-designed shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where several thousand refugees live.
During this week's hearing in Kale, the authorities pointed out that the state should dismantle 72 self-designed shops, where people sell various goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro-designed restaurants.
In Kale, the Prefect Office pointed out that these self-designed companies should be removed because they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by governments and support groups does not provide for the camp’s needs, where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self - established shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those most in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-designed shops, but it understands Kale's prefect's concerns.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply provide food for people who live in "extremely insignificant conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids Camp, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable minors without adults.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of children's cafes.
The letter addressed to Guardian states that the liquidation of the café would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years of age."
On Friday, two charitable organisations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of "Jungļu" camp has risen to 9000 people, which is the highest indicator since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.
The United Kingdom acquires silver rugby-7 in a series of battles when Fiji's government masterfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British team at the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting finals of the Deodoro stadium, Rio Fiji's government unit firmly destroyed them with the result 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, the balls played with the leg, support in the game and brutal power in the game, winning the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The Sakava brought a prize of comfort - a silver medal, which was the third medal of Great Britain on that day. The British team can be proud of their success at the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard fight at the semi-finals, where the Box team suffered a defeat with a result of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played back to Britain in the finals.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, some comfort to Britain could be the fact that at least one British received a gold medal. It is Fiji's team's main coach Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The suffocation is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji has made an impressive start in the match, to reverse Britain’s forces for joy.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his fellows were hit by several buses and the World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau first landed.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai has also increased his predominance by implementing the landing in the right wing.
The result at 12:0 and the British team was not even really touched by the ball.
Michael’s excellent power method did not allow the typical Leon Nakarava to gain three points, but it only had a little effect on Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game, Yas Veremalua landed in the right corner, strengthening the predominance of Britain to 17:0.
After the game, Nazareth further increased the predominance and had left more than a minute until the end... at the end of the first half.
Watemo Ravouvou avoided some unscrupulous methods of British force and crossed the line by getting points.
Landing provided a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 match while the British were still studying.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a profound change in half-time, breaking the Fiji player line... full of four minutes, which was good for the first half-time standards until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team game, won a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to get points for the British team by landing in the left corner and achieving 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the fans of the South Sea islanders sang, waved the flags and danced in tribals.
The joyous attitude of Fiji’s life cannot be admired.
Mata William made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
After the end of the game, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British were able to sit down in the grass after defeat.
In the first half of the day, the semi-final Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce fight both teams were won by land and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown brought the Box team to lead, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and carried the ball between the pillars, giving the British the victory.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England's rugby-15 team player Antonio, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helena Glover and Hetere Stanning's golden moment played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there were only two athletes on the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams, who inspired them up to the second Olympic gold medal in the rowing of couples, becoming the first women in British sports history to succeed.
They were no doubt dominated because, for the 39th time, they won an unparalleled, unprecedented victory.
The two great sportsmen, with the elegance of their swan, slip through the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
A whole team who work hard to constantly improve their performance and contribute most to their success is a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can and has happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum if that is the case.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in a hospital and went 6, 10, and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
It all started.
Flying is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought immediately was about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual with excitement.
Stanninga, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but that means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
Three years have passed with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so a huge thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in five years.
The couple achieves such an enormous speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to draw near, Stanning and Glover were overreached.
We felt every moment.
Helen yelled, "Keeps the rhythm, keeps the rhythm."
Do not lose concentration is really important.
We did a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
That day we didn't have the intention of breaking down the records, but we just did well to row and win the race, and that's what we did.
A few years of rest will decide what to do next.
The next month there will be a wedding for the Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bathal.
So far she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not mean that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

The head of the Colegov SRS will be "directed to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) are already "essentially important" for the approval of candidates Koļegova as head of the SRS.
Rajevski estimated that the approval of both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozola in this government by the head of the SRS was the "first big decision", which could influence his future as politicians.
If now start to change position in the selection of the SRS head candidate, then it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers included the issue of transfer of the head of the VVD Koļegova to the post of Director General of the SRS, as shown by the Government.
Ināra Pētersone, Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola, led the position of head of the SRS in Koļegova after the service management resigned and the competition for the SRS Director General ended without a result.
On Thursday, August 11, in an interview with the head of SRS Dace Pelēka, Latvian Radio admitted that if she was offered to stand as a leader, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he does not consider other candidates for the position of head of SRS for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima Group of the National Alliance, also admitted that NA continues to support Koļegova under the leadership of SRS.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit is threatened by the inability to establish a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
The estimates show that, despite austerity measures taken, Portugal's deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the coming period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against these two countries is the increasing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then by failing to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidemann, has pointed out that Europe loses its confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that European Union rules are recommendive and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the correction of the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Preliminary forecasts indicate that Portugal could achieve its target within the time horizon and that already this year the deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on monitoring the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be set at 0.5% of GDP annually in the next two years.
The fact that, for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture of the third election in the country would not change significantly either.
The most popular party is still the People's Party, chaired by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoi, whose election would again receive less than 33% of the votes.
Only socialists have increased their popularity slightly, whereas the popularity of the anti-saving parties "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudanos" or "Citizens" has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wishes to achieve the involvement of socialists and Cyudanos in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to Rafael Hernando, a representative of the parliamentary group in the People's Party, if the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughter for Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
During the fifth year of surveying the beaches, the activists concluded that the number of waste found is unfortunately increasing every year, and the majority of the visitors to the bathing sites are responsible for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are located in Riga.
The city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned up every day, but it is difficult to fight the dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land may be flushed into water during rain, thereby causing significant damage to its quality.
Except for Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is the message distributed this week by volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign.
By walking on the road along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has come to fruition.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may perhaps even exceed 200 units", said Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvian Radio called, he was located on the Tuja beach, where the voluntary walk along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, even daylight bulbs left in the sand of the sea had to be collected between various household waste and the picnics left.
The party and organizer Ulme says that it is the residents who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in breakdown stage, it is no longer possible to identify them, and wasters, bottles, corks," Ulme says.
There are also bathing sites in Riga among the dirtiest beaches.
For example, almost 800 waste units have been collected every hundred metres in Daugavgriva, which is critically large.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that almost every step of the campaign is also squandering and not everywhere warning or prohibition signs.
"The average numbers of all three bathing sites in Riga - Daugavgriva, Western bulls and Vecāķi - unfortunately come up large and far beyond the desired goal, or the target to which Latvia is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes.
The cleaning of bathing sites in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the council Uģis Vietnieks.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the issue of the culture of these people.
"To those who drink, drink alcohol, smoke and do all the things that cannot be done, even special signs do not work", says Internalis.
This is why Internal Market calls on bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations, and thus fight everyone.
Maybe you can make some new warnings, but, as I said, it will hardly change the situation radically.
"As all together must simply turn to and be intolerant of such offenders," he stresses.
In the meantime, the water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing areas have always had good water quality and there are no bathing restrictions.
"Last time we'll take the analysis at the end of August", says the senior inspection specialist on environmental health Normunds Kadiķis.
Wastes left on land during heavy rains may be flushed into water.
This, in turn, may affect its quality, according to the environmental expert.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of head of Putin's administration.
Did you lose your post?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will in future be the President's Special Representative for Nature, Ecology and Transport.
Having announced the changes, Putin gave Ivanov a welcome word in front of the television cameras: "Famous Sergej Borisovich, we have been working together and doing it successfully for many years."
I am pleased with the way in which you carry out your duties.
I well remember our agreement not to use you as Head of the President's Administration for more than four years.
I therefore take with understanding your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the President's administration is a very important position and it has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections of the State Council in Russia next month, it has been rumoured that this step is related to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible substitute for the President of Putin, so the statement that he himself wanted to hold the office of President in the field of nature protection and transport raised doubts.
According to Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the General Colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanov was approved, which, among other things, envisaged the revitalization of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became the Russian Minister of Defence, and already in 2005 he was the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving office as Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the President's Administration will now also work.
The blame comes from the family party elite.
Ivanov recommended the position of Head of the President's Administration.
Anton Edwardovich and I have been known for a long time.
Even from the times when we worked under your leadership in government.
And for the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"That's why I'm sure he's ready for this work, according to all his professional and personal qualities," said Ivanov.
The blame comes from the family belonging to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather, Karl, has held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The online publication "Meduz" with reference to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to grant permission to use force against the demonstrators.
However, he had been refused and soon lost office.
Shortly afterward, Vino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work for the President's protocol administration.
It has already been reported that the suspension and even arrests of a number of high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives, have rocked Russia.
According to political scientists, President Putin reorganizes the ruling elite before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that, more and more often, representatives of force structures are at the top of the positions.
Judado fighter Nikiforenko also loses Olympics in the first fight.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian Jūdos fighter concluded his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in the 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to Latvian Television that the hopes of Ņikiforenko were very low, and this was already clear before the race.
He also discovered that the Judado fighter had suffered a shoulder injury.
Significantly, to get to the Olympic sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, weight up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s fighter was 25 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been reported that Jevgeny Borodavko held two and a half minutes against Ryunosuki in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms until the opponent managed to win a throw worth a pure victory.
As a result, Latvia has concluded the Judo race in Rio.
Dreams disappear in Rio's sand.
Judaism Jevgeny Borodavko was introduced on Thursday.
Yes, he had a more victorious opponent, but at times the ambitious could surprise him.
He didn't.
The task for Arthur Nikiforenko was even more complex, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tattoo for almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent years, the Latvian Judaisms have been facing the greatest lack of ambition.
Gunārs Čirsons and his financial stand Vladimir Šestakovs, Alexander Jackevičs left Latvia, no longer "Golden Score" went to the edge of the Federation's leadership, - the development of the Judado is on a declining curve.
Jackiewicz, who advises Kazakhstan's Judaists here, and Vsevold Zelion sees no heirs.
But if they don't, they won't.
And it's the Federation's prerogative.
Therefore, the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals from another galaxy in the panorama of the morning.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were looking forward to beach volleyball match Samoilov/Smēdiņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue, as in the "death" group - losers of games are over.
The Latvian duet however had a small derogation - could also be lost, but with no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still grown up in the long-standing previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card boiled in the length of the entire match.
Players were faced with additional difficulties.
At first, it seemed to be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive -.
But he didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so far to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
Canada was broken, Cuba was broken at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was no joke.
At that time, the chandelier was able to fish because there was little work, but when it was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilians, Samoilov and Smeedin, were able to win in two sets, because the first took the lead with 16:15, but on 16 also remained, also exhausted the threshold of lost points.
But it could also be lost with 0:2, because the second-sixth deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, it was possible to win.
The third was already on the Evandra service sign.
There was a chain - an unconvincing service, the second game often fly too close to the network, and Samoilov left very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger Samoilov in the field against the Cubans, then this time he worked better, and only to take the loss to Sasha would be unprofessional.
The Left too was wrong, and it was him who hit the last ball block.
The team's gone.
This time there was no luck too: in the third place alone, two attacks by Evandra almost flew out of the card, but the ball hit the line.
Two walks were next to the line.
The contested episode was also decided by video in favour of opponents.
If Evandra was plagued with services during the first two games, it was very productive for ours.
All of this was in a total loss on the table.
Now, the causes of failure need to be carefully analysed.
Maybe you should have lived next to the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It took us two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps the seven semifinals series gave some confidence.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but come here faster and better acclimatize.
Maybe there was a mistake with finding the top of sports form.
So far, more questions than answers.
For our beekeepers, the game is over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala Master.
The champ and Samoillo have never been friends in life, and they will not be because they have too different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
After the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only in itself, but also in the partner.
The solution is not difficult, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play beavers, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Michael Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Regzi, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Tocho, go back to Mārtiņš Pļavins, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself in the stages of the World Cup.
The sand of Cohabian did not smile to them this time.
That's it.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball becomes more popular, that new pairs enter circulation, and only the rare height is less than two metres.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don't stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the game organizers, as well as choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also some beach volleyballists have searched for a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the very modest accommodations offered by journalists were required to be very high prices.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment for rent.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the Copacabana and Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 meters away, half an hour's walk of a bee arena.
The area is quite sure, because the favela's pathetic, but you can't lose your alert here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think about at once, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre barrier race and high jump Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa has fallen behind her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Bessa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgy and Besa" was first performed in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly performed.
This is why the organisers of the Cesis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided to provide the audience with an opportunity to enjoy Georges Gēršvins Chederva in close cooperation.
"It is a great pleasure for us that, after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera production, this great version of Georges Gēršvins' "Porgy and Bess" opera performance can be enjoyed with us at the new, newly opened concert hall "The Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, the head of the concert hall "The Great Amber".
Opera "Porgy and Bessa" is a story about love, its volatility, passion, household tragedies and simple everyday fun in a bright musical language.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep", says director Viesturs Kairiss.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera is always such a stoppoint - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, lighting one character or another personality or choirs or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this construction," the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor Andris Poga of the opera "Pogijs un Bessa".
Opera visitors agree that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this world-renowned Gurschwin's opera.
Happy is that Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Executive professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert was special because for the first time in the newly opened concert hall "Lielais dzintars" an orchestra played in the orchestra pit and for the first time an opera concert was performed.
The square near the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
Andris Ameriks, Deputy Mayor of Riga, announced at the opening of the Rozentāle anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address in the future might be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentāls Square 1.
Māra Lāce, the director of the museum, admitted that re-registration of the address would create a great bureaucratic burden, however, overall she welcomes this idea and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of basic stone for this idea in 1936 by creating a monument of Burkards Dzins to Janis Rozentāls, who stands at the museum.
Vilhelms Purvītis, the then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm a little embarrassed all the time, but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Lace.
It was announced that the National Museum of Art building officially opened its doors in May this year after major reconstruction and modernisation.
This week will finally begin reconstruction of VEF Culture Palace.
The castle will be restored for about 11 million euros by "Velve" Ltd.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two rooms of viewers, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
Riga City Council intends to raise funds for the project in the amount of six million euros, however, Oļegs Bourovs, Director of the Property Department of Riga City Council, admits that at the moment there is no complete clarity about the project as European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace by attracting European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, will have its money allocated or not," says Barrow.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you would decide yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see that there is another round of discussions, so then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed within the deadlines," Barrow points out.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively organized a farewell concert immediately before the upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent groups of reconstruction works, where each will ensure implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is increasing the availability of the VEF Culture Palace and improving the surrounding territory.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the VEF Culture Castle service offer.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" you can get acquainted with the legendary rock group at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various items characterising "Līvus" - photographs arranged along the time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
Participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public that reflected the creative activities of the "Līvi" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians, who were related to the group "Līvi" and their relatives, also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" were found in 1972, when the vocal instrumental ensemble led by Juris Pavietils was created in Liepaja House of Culture.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976 a fatal meeting took place, when Juris Pavils met Ēriks Ķiģelis and founded a group in the Culture Palace of Metalurgs inviting Ingrīds Gūtmanis, Andris Krūzins and Janis Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not taken place once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to show that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - jeans, hairshots and beards, these boys felt different from the stereotype of the general stage song," says music observer Klass Vāvere.
In addition to the above-mentioned musicians, the group has included such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācējs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Klein and many others.
Entrance free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On the 27th of August, "Līvi" group's 40th anniversary celebration "Līvifest 2" will take place at Liepaja Concert Hall "Pūt, vējņi".
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgaria’s national statistics recorded 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest figure since 2012 and the first figure above zero since October last year when it was positive (0.2%).
Annual average inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index was 101.9% in July 2016 compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation was -0.2% in July 2016 compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 price increases were observed for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); for home appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); for health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the level of the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbignev Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is getting up.
Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia Zbigņevs Stankevičs in an interview with the Independent emphasizes that if we want to gain strength for life, the Gospel message should be placed at its center.
For the power of truth is greater than the utterance of evil.
Many are already on their way to the most holy Virgin Mary in heaven reception celebrations in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the pope’s nuncy has expressed his desire to lead the main church service in Aglon.
Thus, the main message is his responsibility.
The fact that the Cross Road is led by Bishop Jānis Bulis is also a kind of tradition.
He too will make his own message.
I've been running the festival vignilla church last day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francisco's encyclopaedic "Laudato si" and updated the common house, the Earth theme in Latvia's context.
This year, of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed at the heart of life.
It must be demonstrated that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of a person’s life and gives him inspiration for further progress.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, in the Lamp discussion, you said "to return to the understanding of the full man."
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a resource for return today?
The Indian capital robbed a dying man on the road.
No one in the capital of India seemed to know about a man dying on the road side - it turns out that he was asleep on the road side for an hour and then still robbed, informs the BBC.
It's been reported that a man who's been identified as Matibulus was driving a rickshaw while working as a guard at night.
At 5:30 a.m., Matibul went home on the road when he was hit by a car.
A record of surveillance cameras shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about a bleeding man, he was robbed by a raven.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to the hospital where they died of injuries.
Revocation of his candidate for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environment Service, has rescued the government from falling, says Professor Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Colegov's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidature due to the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, the Skudra said that it was hard for him to imagine that next week in the government meeting, Unity, he would support the candidature of Koļegova.
Thus, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Colegov was still approved in office, it would lead to a government demise.
The expert also believes that both the Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieki-Ozola and Prime Minister Maris Kučinski have been consulted before the nomination was withdrawn.
At the same time, it is also a concessions to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In anticipating whether a suitable candidate could be found through a competition, Skudra admitted that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to be led by Dace Pelėka as the Executive Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being examined, it is a hint for the Grey to not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environment Service Koļegova has decided to withdraw his candidate for the post of Director General of the SRS.
Due to the "unity" objections, the Government postponed the approval of Koļegov as Director General of the SRS on Tuesday for a week.
Following the Government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she was still ready to become the head of the SRS.
Later, however, she changed her mind - in her submission to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she pointed out that she withdrew her consent to transfer to the position of head of the SRS and that this was not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska's press secretary Andrejs Vaivars explained to the agency LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant office of the Director General of the SRS.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon there was a road accident involving the State Police car.
The police car with sound and light signals has rushed to the highest category call until Krišjānis Baronas and Dzirnavu Street cross with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the preliminary information indicates that the second vehicle has not missed the police car.
There's a woman in the accident.
This year the number of inhabitants in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the major cities where the population exceeds one million.
According to Eurostat data, the highest proportion of women is in Riga – the capital of Latvia is clearly the first among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius, 121 women per 100 men in Tallinn.
The warning pictograms will be placed near the LNMM.
In the next few days, warning signs – pictograms – will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), and the representative of Riga City Council Property Department Baiba Gailīte told the agency LETA.
Currently, the repair of the glass-screw damage caused by skateboarding has been successfully completed.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed next to it.
Its residents will be told that the surface may be slippery during rain and snow, that cars must not move through it, as well as cycling, roller skates and skateboards.
On the said social network "Facebook" was also written by Ušakovs, who pointed out that no safety hazards are caused by the damage, but that "the skateboards will have to be driven".
Festivals for children and parents - new children playgrounds are set up in Riga.
This summer the municipality of Riga has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
The beach of Kipsala is equipped with a wide, multifunctional gaming vessel with various elements of climbing, bridges, games, rubble and skiing.
Playground for children of all ages.
The field is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small sailors is illustrated by the location of attractions on the river bank of the Daugava with a view to the passenger port and cruise ships visible there.
In turn, a playhouse, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play bombs and other game elements are installed in the playground between Čiekurkalns 4 and 5 cross-line, as well as a gymnastics area with circles of strength and coordination trainings, co-ries and other sports elements.
Under the area covered with rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement has been inserted into the playground from the street.
The reconstructed section of the road has been opened in honeycomb.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the State Roads of Latvia (LVC), as well as the representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and municipalities today opened the reconstructed Russian border of the main state road (Grebneva) - Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 km).
Roads are a country's business card, especially border roads, so it is a particular satisfaction to open a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the situation on the main national roads through the co-financing of European Union funds.
"As the forecasts show, during this planning period, the funds available for roads will be taken into account already in 2018, and we must think about how to continue maintaining the most busy roads in very good quality, and also ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," Uldis Augulis stressed by cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by the traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction works in the period from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) started last year and continued this year after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road section has completely restored road construction and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main roads of the country are the most busy, and by 2018, we intend to ensure that all major roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance and replacement of the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require appropriate funding, and all travellers look with hope at the proposals developed by the expert group to arrange the road financing system," said Lange.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the Medumi centre.
Marked ground works have been carried out: in four stages large-scale dehumidification and large-scale excavation and filling works, smoothed the long profile of the road, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and there has been a new turning point for public transport.
In the past, the road had insufficient load capacity and the terrain was not visible due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road of common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144,80.-156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform various types of works in more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information about all planned repairs of the national road network is available on the website of LVC www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight-loss results, it is very important to choose the right combination of foods," says Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kukleriene.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A balanced combination of diet products can help not only reduce excess weight but also in a targeted way promote various body processes.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a lasting sense of sata and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Journal have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel anxious.
Cayenne pepper and protein - rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, not only creates a sense of satanicness but also reduces the desire for large meals in the next meal.
This combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolically stimulating nutrient – choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
With sufficient intake of these nutrients, the levels of cortisol can be reduced and hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oat flakes, to which fresh berries have been added, are another delicious and fat - burning meal for breakfast that is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, control the sense of jaundice - an appetite stimulating hormone - and hence hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction and also prevent fat formation.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of standing.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the sense of sata.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a longer-term sensation.
You can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combinations of products.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit is broken down mechanically in the stomach, while the chemical does not break down until it reaches the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that takes place in the gut.
The starch divides into three different stages, beginning in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat the sweet food immediately after a meal.
When you eat the sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "capped" in the stomach together with other dishes where it is not chemically digested and starts to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrates together with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthialin, present in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each of which has a different strength, characteristics and time to enter the stomach.
Watermelons, honeymelons, musketmelons and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are present in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said for fats and proteins - fats inhibit protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If a large amount of protein products is consumed, avoid total fat intake.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing proteins) with whole avocados (containing fat).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Food preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products", says the nutritionist.
In most cases nutrients go into loss by cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by cooking.
It is recommended to use the liquid remaining after cooking the vegetables for soup preparation - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to make vegetables, including by evaporating them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
The amount of lycopene increases by 25% when boiling tomatoes over 30 minutes.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins contained therein, making them more easily digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products can reduce vitamin C from 10% to 90%, but fibre freezing does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures a better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-healing iron found in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non- haematological iron in the body by taking products containing non- haematological iron together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-creating iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D rich salmon or sardines to the raw yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries help to stabilise cholesterol levels as well as to avoid blockage of arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticised for Asian caricing
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their own identity on a daily basis in a rather absurd way.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are hazy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million converted selfies per day.
Any error quickly becomes public.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have been criticised in the past when receiving accusations that the application promotes too blacks or light tones of facial skin as a standard of ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to form the eyes of protruding, flat teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – the “yellow face”.
The question was also asked if such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public misfortunes broke out on Wednesday, when the publications “The Verge” and “Motherboard” announced that the effects of lenses were removed from the application.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to represent images of Anime rather than to carve out people of Asian origin.
However, for those who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others strongly denied the similarity with Anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student of Korean origin, got a wide resonant on the video record. In her e-mail, she pointed out that the effects of the lens were "unsatisfied and embarrassed to say no more".
She added that it was hard not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's great youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "in our day such things don't go unnoticed," said 25-year-old Katie Jou during the interview.
On Thursday, Jou, product manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article “Medium” and her phone interview, she explained that she felt that race problems were due to Snapchat’s employment policy, which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then closed its article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether some of the other races work in the company, but they do not hold such a position so that they can express their views safely and conveniently," says Jou, an American of Chinese origin.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on the representation of racial minorities who were not widely represented and would facilitate their inclusion.
Jou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that this is wrong."
The Congress Chamber declares that military officials have distorted reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress Chamber points out that the U.S. Central Command has distorted the reports by depicting a war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it is actually.
The intelligence analysts at the Central Command express their general dissatisfiance with the provisional report of the mission team set up by representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Sub-Committee Republics, stating that their leadership controlled reports on American achievements in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report tells us that intelligence reports, endorsed by senior Centcom leaders, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than it is actually. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the Californian Republic, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors can be found in the organisation's senior management.
This 10-page report illustrates in detail the existing problems in the Central Command's reflection and analysis of America's efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide irrefutable evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have distorted the reports, it shows that the management of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to display a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report points out that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from the Central Administration showed Congress the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Kansas Republican Party, says in his report: 'For more months, the investigation has shown this clearly.'
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the US Central Administration's Chief Officials distorted the reports, representing the ISIS threat in Iraq at a lower level than it was actually.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic state is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence investigates the intelligence activities of Centcom.
On Thursday, members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee made public their own report, in which they agreed to some of the conclusions of the Working Party of the Republican Party.
In his report, the Democratic Representative Adams B. Šifs reported that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports on the ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", deteriorated the ethics of analysts and "distributed facts that were not true."
But Schif and the members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with "pre-established or political positions".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the convention investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspector had launched an investigation following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon's lieutenant commander Patrick Evans announced that Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Department are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism about Islamic state intelligence reminds us of more than a decade-old events when Gregory Hooker, an analyst of Centcom's intelligence, published a study claiming that George V. Bush's administration began a war in Afghanistan, with far too little in mind about its possible consequences.
Hooke also played an important role in revealing the issue of Islamic state intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hooker's team had discovered that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic State oil mills had not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The September edition of The Times reported that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Administration.
At that time, Centcom Commander General Loid Austin III received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Austin retired and replaced General Joseph L. Wotel.
In the U.S. duo with Great Britain, women in the field hockey wins the U.S., thus winning the fourth consecutive victory.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, Thursday Katie Bama won the first two gates for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five gate gains in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember if she had ever succeeded in doing so.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not from those people who count their goals.
But she knows that the American score in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them an unsorted UK in their group, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with the result 2:0 remained unbeatable.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the games of the first round of last match.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter-final and the game will determine only which team will take the first place in a group of six teams and the second.
The first prize winner will avoid meeting a strong Dutch team leader for a little longer.
Despite the absence of a Saturday game, Americans have already called a surprise storm, taking the last place among the 12 teams in London four years ago.
There was also Bama on that team
She grew up in Blubela, a field hockey blackjack she first took in her hands at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Dreksela) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a sample of the youngest players in history.
She was not on the 2008 Olympics because she did not reach the finals.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as a trainer and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
We did not invest as much in London as we do now.
We have changed everything completely.
On Thursday's game Bama revealed the result by getting the gate in the first half of the day with a back drop from a close distance.
India started the game without winning in its account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly won the gate.
She introduced the ball to the enemy zone on the left side of the field, then she tried to get to the middle of the field and send the ball into the enemy gate, putting the American at 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales gained another gate.
This was the first U.S. gatekeeper Jackie Brige's dry game, every one of the first three games going through one gate.
She's run in.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how good will show up the game on Saturday.
The most depressive food of the depression period is "Self meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room for a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pâté, or fuagra, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: filled with eggs in tomato sauce, potato pulp and a plum bottle in dessert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
The last book of Kou "Garden Snake" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane in her book "97 Abeles" describes life through food rental house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Self meal," published by Harper publishing house on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary, they had a meal together by the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch menu located in the Flathyron district, which has been in operation since 1929, when the great depression began.
The 54-year-old Ms. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and grated olives, while the 57-year-old Ms. Kou ordered turkeys, potatoes and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake goose, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation about the food of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the counterfeit hare was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny and a bean bunny.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it is like to eat so many peanuts that they would be at lunchtime.
Mr. Kou has stopped.
"Surely it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the predepression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat for their men-workers and were served freshly prepared condiments at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was Americans who sent food to Europeans. The meal described how Americans adapted to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the American people's everyday life," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on this subject.
The new budget diets became just as important: such unknown dishes as counterfeit hare and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, because chefs could hide unattractive ingredients under creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when caloric numbers and nutritional values were more important than tastes, new, unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for cooking onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds, "This was not a popular addition to the lunch table."
Mrs Ziegelmanes stresses: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many home food recipes adapted to difficult times.
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for the Household Economy from 1923 to 1943, identified eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised householders to become "economics" and accept challenges such as making pasta and carrot mixes in a delicious meal.
"Serious Maltite" is a meal of historical delicacies.
It is especially interesting to see the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude "let me eat cakes".
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and meals in Iowa, he actually ate like a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says, "He liked European cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost golden living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example in his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt paid off a domestic servant who didn't teach how to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most untasting dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst prepared dishes".
As soon as the country’s economy recovered, most culinary signatures of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as to how to apply science in the culinary sector, Mrs Ziegelmane added.
The couple say that when writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she couldn’t throw her food out.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually shocked people."
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we ate in the Essenberga menu, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert — a plum bottle that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's a plum foam," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at that time the habit of giving a chic name to modest dishes was common.
It does not contain pollen, only dried plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently put their spoons in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more couches.
Sounding like an experienced "economicist", he said to his wife, "A fine-fashioned hazelnut."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that “Gilead Sciences Inc.” is entitled to receive back expenses for the services of lawyers paid by it in the case regarding the termination of the hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company “Merck & Co Inc.”
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of a fine of GBP 200 million for the dissolution of two Merck patents, which threatened it with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a US federal judge found violations of Merk's activities, such as lying after taking an oath and other unethical activities.
On Thursday, U.S. district judge Bet Labsons Freeman pointed out that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was already initiated in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active ingredients of sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead.
The forces supported by the United States claim to have completely taken over control of the city of Manbiya from the Islamic State.
The U.S. forces have completely taken control of the city of Manbidja in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, reported the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning up the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages from the civilian population who had been killed by combatants, and Šarfan Darvisz of the SDS's Ally Manbige Military Council told Reuters news agency.
"Now the city is under our full control and we are searching for combatants," he informed the agency Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton's income reached 10.75 million dollars and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return, which shows that the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated 1 million US dollars, mainly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned approximately 5.3 million dollars in his performance as a spy and former Secretary of State, earned $3 million in income from his work at the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election ally - U.S. Virgin state senator Tim Key and his wife Anna Holton have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Clinton and Tim Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various excuses and reservations, so that promises to disclose his tax information do not need to be fulfilled.
The publication of tax information paid is a record practice for US Presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
The New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers refer to the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter record, announced tax information of the candidate for the Democratic Party by Ians Sams, partner of the Clinton campaign.
On Thursday, special adviser Michael Kohen told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to disclose tax information before the audits had been completed.
Critics of the tramp, including candidate for President of the Republic of 2012 Mita Romney and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real property size, donations and other business obligations, including his obligations with Russia.
Clinton poured out oil on fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans require Trump to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue during the economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She said to the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
“Polico” says that during the 1990s Tramps paid very little or no tax for two years, and on Friday, the author of the business column of “New York Times” said that many accountants and lawyers believe that today, too, nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the billionaire's proposal, Varena Baffet, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
Last week during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffet called on Tramp to exchange tax returns.
Baffet said that he is also being audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump is afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chapacau, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 out of their income is wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises a hotel in Berlin for shutting off Israel's long distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of the French film of Jewish origin has raised a storm in social media, when he discovered that the code of Israeli distance conversations is not available at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin. The hotel’s employees base this on the request of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary film about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his frustration with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lanzman tried to find Israel's remote chat code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
It's Lanzman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call the country through its call center.
The Director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received was "shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate decision of the hotel management".
The reason for removing the code became even more angry with the film director.
"The majority of guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jakov Hada-Handelsman, has called this case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same thing in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened precisely in Germany is even more humiliating in this hotel network.
No explanation required.
The official pointed out: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event also gained quite a wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply designed for Arab customers.
Another record said "honour" indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the accusations, declaring that all this was "misunderstood" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski's representative.
And add that the code was once again added to the list.
The police are using rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education system reforms.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the law enforcement tried to expel students, which resulted in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their displeasure with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the São Paulo will close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to express their support for the abandoned President Dilma Rousef, whose imperative was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finish first, bringing the gold medal to Britain in cycling
As a result, the first men's cycling team was finished by Scotcher at the Rio bicycle line, which took place last night. The British team protected the title of their champions, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
A 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making the legendary Scott Sir Chris Hoy proud and bringing victory to the favorite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Championship in London, even though Hoy had already finished his career as a sportsman.
The problems were at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, because we had to replace the experienced starter, Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches gave hope to Skinner, seeing his potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Chaney - champions who started with Hoy and Skinner four years ago, who set up the Olympic qualification record, but a better start was for New Zealand team
However, the British trio obtained gold medals.
The Hindus were in a close circle, Kenny stood up for leadership, and Skinner protected that leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in winning, because Hindes drove with a higher gear to allow Kenya, and especially Skinner, to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindez at the moment when they climbed on the honorary pedestal.
The 23-year-old glass goose said, "It was an indescribable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning together with Kenya and Hoy in the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes admitted that they deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
Later, he rebutted this comment and the British competitors could not prove the opposite.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hinde said, "The British flags in the truces reminded London."
In the last three months, we have become a unified team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will race for a country that won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed repeat Hoya’s success by obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal won. In addition, Kenny was born on 23 March (it seems to be the sacred date of the British, because Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born this day).
Hoy was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I just enjoy it.
The team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
If you're honest, it's a little lonely to win."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as knights."
That day it was the only fight about medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clency, Steve Burke and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification time for four kilometers.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will certainly be at the heart of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had disagreements with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
On the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanne Rovsell Schand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibolda from Milan set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will, hopefully, win medals in the middle of the Olympics.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes have gone various ways, following accusations of sexuality and abuse of dignity, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also finish their career.
However, starting with the first race on the biketrack, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland melting plant is becoming uncertain because an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of aluminium meltdowns and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become uncertain because its main client energy company announced the termination of cooperation.
This communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be interrupted in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 per cent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting facility, which led to the decommissioning of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alkoa Portland melting plant is loss-making and can be closed.
These events were the result of the speculations over the years about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of the factory's production.
The factory energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its "Loy Yang A" power plant in Latroubes Valley, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumia, in addition to the company's shares are owned by Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL" hopes to continue the work of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the melting plant," said its representative.
“AGL” announced that contracts are so-called “risk-limiting contracts”, which is expected to enter into force as of November 2016.
Contracts have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore remain valid until 2017.
"AGL is planning to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
With effect from the tax year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already included losses of USD 187 million in its forecasts, with the conclusion that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue its activities or to supply it with energy.
The US company reports that in 2010 it concluded an agreement with "Loy Yang" for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation why it will terminate cooperation.
The analysts have expressed concerns both about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and about the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
"AGL" CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that analysts estimate that he uses 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts per year.
If these two plants left the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people's demands are rejected, and the budget's reduction could lead to a worsening of the situation.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal eviction - are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that a reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farel, director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, said that the latest report by the Association of National Legal Centres states that thousands of people in need are currently denied legal aid.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision was not annulled, the situation would only get worse.
He also says, "The legal centre in Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance."
People trying to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all of them have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Prosecutor General and the Queensland Senator, George Brandis, to stop reducing funding immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the country's average level.
Now is the time to also draw attention to the needs of local communities and their clients and to invest in this important area by the Palazchuk government.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued because one of the employees pulled out a firearm
New York: The organizers of the Donald Trampa campaign have been sued because they have not acted in response to the information that its North Carolina Operation Manager has turned a firearm against an employee when they were driving in a single car in February.
This incident was described in a court claim lodged on Wednesday by Vincent Borde, a former campaign programmer, at the Charlotte Court.
The Bordeaux said that he had been waiting for months to begin the internal examination of this case, but he understood that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Phillip "went out the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the stop against Vincent's knee", Brordi claims in his complaint.
He also states that when he complained to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordeaux learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"We don't have to shoot to cause damage," says Bardhi in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was presented, the candidate for President of the Republican Party announced to the people that the "Second Amendment People", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges won the election.
The tramp campaigners announced that the media had removed his words from context, and he had never incited anyone to violence.
At their request, they want to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for negligence in monitoring and from Phillips for attack, unlawful use of the weapon and emotional stress.
The tram representative Hope Hicks did not comment immediately.
Unable to communicate with Phillips.
The WCCB - Charlotte Local News Agency reports Philip has recently left the campaign.
Likewise, it has not been possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultancy Services".
The presidential candidate of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - parish and sports festival in Kuļciems.
On Saturday at Kuļciems, for the first time people gathered on the parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the festival would cease.
A new page has now been split.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the boot was flying, the man's left hand throw, "balling" was not at all in any of the Olympics.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, diligent, and eloquent he is.
After the sports, everyone gathered in the open air stage, where the parish celebration began.
In the meantime, there was also a "child corner" where the little ones could break into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the facial make-up.
The new version, which could also become a tradition, was a parade of cars and motorcycles.
All were addressed by Inga Kadike-Skadiņa, the Head of the Administration of Kuļciems, who wished a nice rest and dry time, but the rain did not disturb much.
The celebration continued with the greeting of Kuļciems' youngest residents.
It is really good that the parish has supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With performances, amateur art collectives from Engure municipality came to the villagers – the audience very much liked the performances of the older dance group "Rudens rhythms", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and youth dancers "Golden Pearl".
And it's nothing that someone on the wet stage also slipped.
Of course, local people and visitors were delighted by the famous actors duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Žilīte Krāniņa, as well as Berzciems' attractive wives from the fishermen's farm "Dienas".
The ball was played by a group of Brugis.
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This makes Heathrow very attractive to me, as in London in 2012, where we invested a lot of work so that all regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Ostend won a lot of the Olympics.
And we will do this again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the area around Heathrow.
As in the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that Heathrow's expansion is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience at the airport and the whole of Britain.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion pounds, falling into time and budget starting with terminal 5, which has been called the best airport terminal in the world for five years to terminal 2, which has been built between the two most intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
London's 2012 Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Board of Heathrow and a former Secretary for Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman is on the road trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses to an accident when she moved early on Thursday morning on the highway over several cars.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in Vo Canton.
A Vo Canton police report says that a desperate desire to commit suicide resulted in a woman learning on the road in the dark, where she was driven by several cars.
In a clear attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49 - year - old Swiss, gathered several cars, including a heavy car.
She died on the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others have not yet been identified, says the police, which are calling for the drivers and witnesses involved.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated, which is a logical step, and lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet clear whether one of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hoffteller adds, "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last five years indicate that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was excused for killing a man who was sleeping on the A1 road near Paijerne in August 2014.
The court found out that the 22 - year - old victim had drunk and later tried to fall asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer, who was on his way to the scene of the accident, was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone with information about an accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet collects signatures for organising a new SRS manager’s job competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" launched the collection of signatures for the organisation of a new Head of State Revenue Service (SID) job competition.
A petition addressed to the ministers of the National Associations (NAs) and the Greens/Farmers Union (ZZS) states that the public wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
Petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of Inga Koļegovas, the candidate for the post of Director General of the SRS, is opaque and non-professional.
It recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society disillusioned with government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," says the petition.
Its author Jānis B. indicated that the public does not know the criteria for choosing a post in Koļegova.
It is also not clear what the candidates intend to do in SRS.
The petition indicates that the State Registry should create a new, open competition where professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Koļegova for the post of Head of the SRS last week, this week the government was to approve her for the new post, but all the ministers of the party "Unity" voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, I played bad.
The beach volleyballists Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš have hoped for a prize at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, however, if not, there is no difference in where to conclude the competition, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball pairs on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the subgroups tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalveš Oliveir and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year major sports forum.
In the match of the three subgroups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio of three small points between couples was then counted, which was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duet after the convincing loss suffered in this match.
"In the first six we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we remained on 16 points," the game was remembered by Šmēdiņš.
I don't even know how we stayed without points in the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
After that, everything was fine in the second set and the game was broken at the top of the set, and it should have been a good basis for the third set.
We started it in the same way, but after we exchanged the parties, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so the small points were important.
"It was necessary to play in a similar way, rather than repeatedly return 3-4 points in a row," said the athletes.
We knew that Evandra could be maintained.
"In the first six we met it, in the second we put 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 he left the game," remembered Šmēdiņš.
We tried to show you the best game.
It happened at times, no, at times.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible needed.
"If we lost, I played bad," said Samoilov.
We waited for a good service from Evandra and managed it quite well in our first sets, but the third one opened up the service and found it difficult to create an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes at Pedro’s service, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match today, athletes had no nervousness.
"We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed a better service reception," the athletes said.
"They played well and finally came to the "urra."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable one we could have had.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but we did not even get out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for a medal and we too, but then there is no difference - 25th or fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilova was already in his third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he started with Martin Pļavins in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of the potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" is following the process of opening the gas market from the position of both the consumer and potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company's press secretary.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by the gas market design and legal framework."
"This is why we are actively involved in regulatory enactment and commenting, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (ME) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations Project "Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas", which will change the existing principles of functioning of the natural gas market, giving natural gas users the right to freely choose natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
By working on a new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of trade in natural gas as simple as possible and user-friendly.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "trader's central model" has been selected, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service location, leaving the distribution system operator responsible for the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
Please note that a gradual opening of the market for household customers is planned - after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from an existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
In turn, traders will have to choose the natural gas trader with whom the natural gas sales contract is to be concluded.
Prior to the conclusion of the contract for the sale of natural gas, for a certain period of time, trade in natural gas will be ensured by the previous natural gas trader at a price fixed by him.
The Cabinet Regulations draft deals with the rights and obligations of natural gas trader, system operator and users in detail.
The regulations shall lay down the procedure for supplying natural gas to users and terminating its delivery, requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gasified facility in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure for settlement of received services, the amount of late payment interest, the procedure for changing traders and the supply of natural gas to users in the event of disruption of the supply of natural gas; the procedure for ensuring the supply of natural gas to related users by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to judge about salary increase of the Director General of SRS.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS)) plans next week to talk with Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (ZZS) and government coalition partners about raising the remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
On Friday, Reizniece-Ozola pointed out to journalists that the issue of raising the salary of the Director General of SRS must be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to potential re-tenderers.
Also next week we will talk about changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think about a specific candidate to address the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed her opinion that Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environment Service, would have been a good Director General of the SRS.
In turn, with regard to the current executive position of the head of the SRS, Daci Peleklio, who has expressed readiness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated his opinion that the new director-general of SRS should be "from the outside" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from the vacation so that amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS would be moved as soon as possible.
The agency BNS has already announced that Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environment Service, Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), has submitted an application to withdraw his candidate for the post of Director General of the SRS.
In her application, she said that this is not an easy choice, but her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure in the last two weeks, even though they have failed to take legal action.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that Ināra Pētersone, the previous Director General of the SRS, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and Europe are on the rise and the value of the US dollar is on the rise.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors' confidence being positively influenced by the statements of the Minister of Oil Affairs of Saudi Arabia, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September will take action to stabilise the world's oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached record high levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also led to a rise in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar grew on Thursday in relation to the euro, to the British pound and to the Japanese yen.
The price of WTI crude oil in the New York e-commerce in September increased by USD 1.78 per barrel to USD 43.49 per barrel.
The Brent crude oil price for supplies in October increased by $1.99 - to $46.04 per barrel on the London Stock Exchange.
Last year the turnover of the canning producer "Blue Lagoon" fell by 33.8%.
Last year the turnover of the canning producer "Blue Lagoon" was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than in the previous year, whereas the losses of the company dropped 5.7 times - to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company was dealing with losses due to several reasons, including the permanent lack of working capital caused by the exit of the Baltic market by the Unicredit Bank, terminating the pre-existing credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to obtain a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
The company's financial indicators during the last year were also negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and customers' unwillingness to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognised price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - highest - prices," the company's management points out.
Also in 2015, "Blue Lagoon" started discussions with potential investors, including evaluation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment, which ensures higher production speed, was purchased," the company's management pointed out.
The management of the "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to execute such orders that were so far impossible.
The first production batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As plans for the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the plans for sale.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", the company's management points out.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign cooperation agreements on fish products supplies to Iraq.
In 2016, the Blue Lagoon sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus, and this September it will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lagoon worked with turnover of 6.347 million euros and losses of 5.113 million euros.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igors Širšon (10,89%).
Welcome to 15 p.m. to the museum to welcome the film show Zara Leander and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered as the beginning of the career and inspiration of the adored film sofa Zara Leandere.
The visit of Zara Lendere to her grandmother Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fatal in Riga in 1924 because she discovered the unusual low counterlt for Zara Leandere woman, which she tried to debut on the stage of the Riga Cabare Theatre.
Maybe it was by chance in Riga that it became the fatal turning point in Zara's creative path towards the world's celebrity.
Riga Zāra Leandere had warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga for a show, but unfortunately, these hopes were not destined to be fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and in the role of the outstanding Zara Leandere will feel the great Ieva Kerēvica.

The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance compensation to a family for the cancellation of the flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, which led to the refusal of the planned visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance was received a compensation application from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible due to the cancellation of flights at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged for booking accommodations which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchase of a festival ticket of EUR 204.
On the other hand, the airline promised to reimburse the customers for the money spent on the plane tickets.

A neighbor’s repair forces a man to leave the house at broken ceilings.
Dmitry Saidjaševs, whose neighbor has started the major repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been faring down from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors built arbitrarily and my apartment had damaged ceilings.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the House Manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
"The owner must go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrijs.
The guest expert arrived, recorded the events and admitted that the division was not in a satisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitri’s first application to the building board, and no one was able to answer that question before the beginning of this week.
At the Construction Board, said that's the law, wait if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the manager of the house, then the manager of the house again to the building board, and then there is an impasse", says Dmitrijs.
After examining the entire pile of paper, it is clear that the construction works have been stopped, even though it can be heard from time to time that someone is working there.
An expert examination must be carried out within a further two months and within a period of six months, all these defects must be corrected by the owner of the apartment carrying out repairs.
The independent expert has drawn up its opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid contained in this supporting structure has been affected, thus there is no assurance that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"This is why we have asked for additional explanations from this expert," says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is between 70 and 700 euros, but in this case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert's opinion is awaited, the building board decided that both apartments should not be exploited - both in which construction works are carried out and in which Dmitri's apartment is located.
"This is the case in the construction board practice, where in this way, because of their ignorance or simply their unwillingness, citizens may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the construction board.
Dmitry now has to find another place to live - with relatives, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbor’s civil routine, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the arbitrary construction, it is now prohibited to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his opinion, and it may have to wait for up to three weeks.
The resulting losses will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because he has not taken account of what the building board said.
Guess what!

The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into five-star hotels will cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, LETA is told by Gita Želve, the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri".
The hotel is the first stage of reconstruction of the former Ķemeri sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel will take place in May 2018.
Želve notes that the costs of an accurate clinic are not yet known.
She notes, however, that it will be located in a former Ķemeri resort polyclinic building with an area of about 12,000 square feet [12,000 sq m].
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest in this fund, says Želve.
As George Jones, Executive Director of G Capital Europe said earlier, it is planned to invest between 12 and 15 million euros in the development of the former resort clinic, with a total investment of more than 30 million euros.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park area of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive nature tourism site, the improvement of the territory and the construction of a parking lot on Emila Dāriņa Street, which will promote socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase the number of tourists, Jurmala City Council plans to attract EUR 14,5 million from the funds of the European Union, co-financing three to four million euros.
Design works are planned until mid-2017, but construction and arrangement works will start next autumn.
As reported, the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" plans to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
Yet, the reconstruction lasted.
In the 2010 annual report it was stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control at "Ķemeri" sanatorium, and that already in 2011 "reconstructive of the future hotel "Ķemeri" was completed" and preparatory work for the opening of "Kempinski" chain hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel Ķemeri" confirmed its readiness to buy the set of Ķemeri sanatorium belonging to the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia", but one month later the auction was declared not to have happened because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set according to the starting price of the last auction, which did not happen - EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA informed Ieva Aile, the representative of the City Council, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing, the infrastructure will be arranged - the historic Ķemeri Park will be restored, an interactive nature tourism site will be created, roads and parking lots will be arranged.

The e-mail of former NATO Commander Bradlov has been broken by Russian hackers.
Hackers that broke the U.S. Committee on Democracy (DNC) computers may have committed several other cyber attacks, including the email of former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bradlov and the servers of George Soros's Open Society, announced the business news agency Bloomberg on Thursday.
The hackers published the information on the website "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, there are correspondence by Bradlow and reports about the work of the Soros Institute.
Hackers Institute computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers related to Russia's special services who broke DNC's emails.
The Wall Street Journal, for its part, reports that the U.S. President's Obama Administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the bursting of DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have to formally prosecute Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities in a cyber attack on the servers of the Democratic Party.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website made public in July about 20 000 e-mails from the DNC computer system, from which it is understood that the leaders of the Democratic Party have sought to undermine the campaign of the former competitor Vermont Senator Childrenis Sanders of the party candidate Hillary Clinton in the fight for the start of democratic nominations in the presidential elections.
According to US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the attack on democratic servers, and other US special services, considers Russia's relationship with the cyber attack to be almost indisputable.
McCartney: The Beatles threatened the presence of Joko Ono.
Paul McCartney admitted that Joko Ono's presence created a feeling of threat to the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the deceased John Lennon, but while she went to visit the group at the recording studio, she frightened McCartney because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about both relationships, he said to the magazine "Rolling Stone", "It's really good."
We felt threatened at that time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We managed it, but not quite successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Joko, she did not sit in the control room, but in our four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with a former group member, Ringo, and at times confirms the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" has "completed".
When asked if he was still meeting the second only member of the legendary rock group, McCartney said to the magazine Rolling Stone: "Frequently not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a heavy divorce.
Instead, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see your pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I'm just listening to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once an inhabited planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been an inhabited planet.
Researchers at NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to study Venus’s history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, water - free, and almost carbon - free atmosphere, had similar conditions to the earth.
Scientists have already mentioned that Venus’s slow rate of rotation is due to a dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus has ever had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and has turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's former topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there have been enough water and geographical diversity on the planet to create life and prevent evaporation.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In simulation of the GISS model, the Venus Rotation Model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained by GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio in the press release.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes a rain that in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
This results in a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees below the temperature on earth today.
The model represents Venus’s history, which is similar to the evolution theory developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it has once been inhabited, over a billion years Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans evaporated, and its spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
With the water completely evaporated, there was only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the position of "Avalanche" coach
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado "Avalanche" and vice president of hockey operations, Patrick Roy, presented an apology, stating the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President of Colorado and General Joe Sakick confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful as the chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado Club's hockey operations," says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the glory it needs and achieve a higher level of performance.
To achieve this, the visions of the main coach and hockey operations must be fully consistent with those of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Says Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and we wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with "Avalanche" team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received Jack Adams' award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the shutdown games Colorado team was won by minnesota hockeyists. Since then, the club has not entered the shutdown games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind "Wild" team without obtaining the second special invitation of the organizers of the Western Conference.
The famous hallkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with Montreal "Canadians" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and strike
Staff strikes on the remuneration of workers on the North Sea Oil Platforms have been carried out because both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, and the negotiators tell.
Periodically, there are strikes against the oil processing company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms, where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions "Wood Group" and "United" and "RMT" have agreed to resume negotiations on resolving the dispute.
In the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of next week with a view to re-examining problematic issues.
The trade unions said that their recent events, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were against the planned wage cuts of 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure, this year Wood Group reduced wages for workers in the North Sea by 9 percent.
Already in 2014, the company reduced salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
In turn, Shell has already reduced wages for several thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is all the more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea was vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explained that the North Sea and the country as a whole needed an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler's size star speed in the Pleyade constellation.
The latest mission of Kepler’s telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the star speed at the Pleyade constellation.
New data help astronomers to understand why stars are turning at different speeds in this constellation, as well as how the speed of the stars is attributable to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analyst Louis Rebula.
The display constellation is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are only beginning to grow to about 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
With the maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler shall measure the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the occurrence of prominent star areas, such as sunspots.
The latest star - speed catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
Rebula compares stars with dancers, larger dancers perform pyrutes less slowly than smaller dancers.
Rebuls tells that in the "ballet" of Plejade it is seen that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to its close proximity, the Pleyade constellation serves as an excellent space laboratory where star characteristics can be compared with speed of rotation.
Rebuls says that the Pleyade constellation helps to develop theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions, both for older and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of star turning slows down and about the complete process of stopping.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the Plajade star rotation in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
