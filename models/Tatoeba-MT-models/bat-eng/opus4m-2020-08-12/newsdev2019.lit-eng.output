The thousands of crowds panic when the barrier collapses in the Central Park
Thousands of people who were panicked at the event because of the political nature of the possible shots, let go of the Central Park when the police barrier collapsed.
Known personalities – the Governor of New York, Andrew Cumo, Republican senator Jeff Flake, Janeta Jackson, John Legend – invited viewers to engage in a turbulent country policy.
Following the fall of the barrier at the event on Saturday evening, the authorities quickly assured the viewers that they were safe.
The event, which started in the sunny afternoon, focused mainly on social justice.
About 60,000 observers gathered at the Universal Citizens' Festival in the Great meadow, where Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars were due to appear.
Some speakers asked the audience to call the members of the Congress representing them and express their views on the Senate meetings held this week on the candidate for the Supreme Court Bretto Kavanaugh.
Continuous Alastair Seeley winning series for British Supersport in Assen
Alastair Seeley maintained the winning position in the British Supersports race
Alastair Seeley won the third victory in the five British Supersport race, which won the 12 wheels in the Dutch city of Assen on Saturday.
The racer from Karikfergus bypassed Yamaha driving Jack Kennedy in 0,05 seconds.
The 38-year-old winner also triumphed this month in Silverstone and Oulton Park.
Seeley represents the Northern Ireland team EHA Racing, with which he has already won the international North West 200 race in May.
The former British champion played all the race with Kennedy and despite all the efforts of the double, he failed to beat the rival from Northern Ireland.
David Allingham, a friend of Seeley's team, stayed seventh on Saturday's Supersport race.
Scott Swann “British Talent Cup” race finished in the eighth.
Glenn Irwin, driving in Be Wiser Ducati, trying to get up above the current fourth place in the championship, was the fourth on two Sunday's British Superbike qualifying races.
This week, it was announced that Irwin will move to the JG Speedfit Kawasaki team during the 2019 season.
Michael Laverty from Toome, driving Tyco BMW, took 13 seats, and Andrew Irwin and his PBM Ducati took 14 seats.
Why do Hong Kong’s domestic workers learn dance movements?
In Hong Kong, around 300 000 foreigners are employed as domestic workers.
They are required by law to reside in employers' homes.
These employees work six days a week, up to 18 hours a day, for low remuneration.

The mayor of Bedford will honor the spray seller Linas Ognissanti
Photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season of the year, and in winter – sparrows.
For more than 40 years, the woman will be honoured who has been traded in the city centre with sparrows and ice creams – she has been given a private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who sells ice cream and butterflies on Dinky Donuts Bedford Midland Road, was invited with her family to have a afternoon tea.
Almost 3 000 people signed a petition online to be awarded or recognised.
Mr Ognissanti said that she had the honour of receiving such praises.
According to Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and his children and grandchildren were invited to visit his office to see the city's regals and historical artifacts and to drink afternoon tea.
"Lina Bedforfe has a special place, and her kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lin for her work in our city."
Mr. Ognissanti thanked, in her words, the "pleasant" inhabitants of Bedford, who thought about her, and said: "This is a great honor and a beautiful act."
The petitioner, Sarcab Mahmood, said that he did not expect such signatures.
When he heard about the reception scheduled for the end of the year, he said: "I am very pleased about Lina, because she deserves it because of her excellent character."
On the road with Alster's Lambretta club
Motors Lambretta were indispensable as fashion satellites in the 1970s.
A group of fans of the Italian scooter are trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after Alster's first Lambretta club was established, this weekend around 100 motorcyclists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Ferman County.
One of the two first club members Chris Wilson acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“For me, the scooter was just a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in other ways.
It was a little sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old for it," he said.
"It was quite cheap and quite reliable, you could buy it at an affordable price, and when you bought it, you could do more than just drive from A to B."
He took part in a separate start race for Lambretta in the Isle of Man TT ring.
The first Lambretta Alster club was founded in the early 1980s and reorganized 12 years ago.
"In 1971 the motorists and other forms of transport became less and less interested in people, and the clubs suffered from the anxiety in general, so I thought, "Everything, it's the end", said Chris.
"Then, at some point, interest came again and it seemed to have grown more and more."
Philipas Steele is the Secretary of Alster's Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, with responsibility for membership.
“The motives of all are different.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture, as almost everything started.
Others are racing enthusiasts or handicrafts – you will find different people here.
There are others who just have fun with the vine.
Many scooters have been modified, so there are no two uniforms.
It is possible to keep the scooter still and to drive at 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some highly modified scooters could probably reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, there were faults, some of the scooters had to be pushed on.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as that of Lambretta's homeland Italy, this time the sun shone the motorists driving in Ferman County.
Ruth Davidson asks for a silence on Braxito
Ruth Davidson asked her fellow Conservatives for a "silent period" so that the Prime Minister could reach an agreement on Braxito.
The head of the Scottish taverns said that, within two years of the EU referendum, enough time was needed for the debate.
She expressed her opinion following Boris Johnson's words about the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "an insane and completely absurd".
She said that it was time to support the Prime Minister for the BBC programme, Sunday Politics Scotland.
At a party conference that brought together Tori activists in Birminga, she said: “In the past two years, we have had time to debate.
The former Foreign Secretary took office in one of the best offices of the country's history and during that period a large part of the current plan, which was already recognised last November, was drawn up.
Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to conclude the deal and help implement the plans in the country.
I think a silence period would be very useful."
Her comments followed the sharp criticism of the Braxito debate, which was expressed for the first time by the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview conducted by BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured that she believed in Braxitu and that her office plan could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also stated that he would commit himself to preventing the second Scottish referendum on independence by participating in the next elections, because in 2014 "the Scottishs were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible repeat referendum on Brexito, she replied: "If we talk about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that you cannot repeat a referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would be hypocritical if I said that another referendum could be held on 'Brexito', because I expected a different result."
Path M8 after police incident reopened
Highway M8 was opened again after the police incident at Glasgow.
According to the police, the road was closed a little earlier than 07.00 in both directions at the 15 Townhead intersection in case of pedestrian concerns.
Traffic on the closed road did not run for three hours and was disturbed in the city where the marathon Great Scottish Run takes place.
In 20 C.E., a man was later taken to Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
A friend of Christine Blastey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual abuse suspected of being Brett Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was a high school friend with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Kavanaugh of sexual abuse when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate's court committee and explained that although he did not remember the party at the house where the attack might have taken place, he believed in Ford's story.
In the past, Keyser made a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember the party and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, when witnessing against the Committee on the Judiciary, Kavanaugh often mentioned Keyser's statement as proof of his integrity, but did not mention Keyser's statement that it believed in Ford's words.
President Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation on Friday, when Republican senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked for time to study and postpone the vote of the entire Senate on Kavanaugh for a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee through his lawyer stating that he wanted to "contribute to an additional FBI investigation" concerning Kavanaugh.
“However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember a party or gathering where he would have been with or without Dr. Ford,” says Keyser’s lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser "does not reject Dr. Ford's story and has already told the press that you believe in Dr. Ford's certificate."
"However, the simplest and irreplaceable truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not remember this event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, alleged to have been near the attack, said he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
The illegally convicted people of Chicago tell about life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unscrupulous policeman has exploited innocent people in social housing and has unduly arrested a large number of people.
To date, 42 people have been convicted illegally.
Instead of the social housing project, Ida Wells now has only an empty area, and in the past over a decade, their population has almost been exploited by corrupt Chicago policemen.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical group of extortion of property, counterfeiting of police reports and evidence and coercion.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those sentenceds who have been cleared by Cook County Prosecutor General Kim Fox.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You hindered him from acting and earning," Cleon Glover told about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that area,
but I had nowhere to go," said Willie Martin.
Lawyers from Foxx’s Ethics Division review further 30 to 40 Watts-related cases.
Ida Wells, a resident of social housing, Landon Allen said that many people had decided not to keep silent about Watts.
"Many things didn't shut up," he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed the people's words about the official sergeant.
“He has his own gang.
Who will believe in us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at Chicago University’s correctness project, says that until now no one really believed them.
"Everything lasted because they didn't look important to them and cared about them, because they were black people living in social housing, so they were thought to have committed some sort of crime," Tepfer said.
"Sergeant Watts was in prison for 22 months in 2013 for trying to steal an FBI informant.
Martez Wise was also put in prison thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," said Wise.
"I lost four years without a problem."
Fidelity, who has been living for 72 years, believes in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity blocks chains was noticed until 2018, when all corporations started to talk about this technology.
The CEO, Abby Johnson, led investment in cryptolites, the most risky and volatile asset class of recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior managers were just curious about what was happening, especially in the bitcoins market," Johnson said.
We started to negotiate, and we realized that we had to find out.
The curiosity led to the start of the "casting" of bitcoins in the New Hampshire department when the price of this crypto was about $180.
In December last year, the price was close to $20,000 and, according to Johnson, "we were surprised: after the price rise we started to earn money, although we never expected it."
She didn't tell me how many bitcoons she made or how much Fidelity.
The employees of Fidelity are clearly interested in these technologies.
A block-chain club for employees, called "Biths and Blocks", which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has about 2 600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to check the crypto balance using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, bitcoins were made available.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or refused them for at least a short time.
We're trying to watch the market.
For the time being, Katie Chase, the chief executive of the Fidelity Application Technology Centre and head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-used block chains.
Chase was not able to comment on specific projects, but revealed that there was a great deal of interest from customers, partners and employees.
“It’s all very new.
If you study the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find evidence of the concept," said Chase.
We have tried to adapt the blocks' chains to different situations and have learned a lot, but technology is not so advanced as to solve such problems."
To date, the group has put more emphasis on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, by chips or to use blocks in the supply chain.
"As long as this is not at the centre of attention, I think it will eventually get interested," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready for this."
As an example, she referred to Pebble, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but eventually paid off Fidelity.
Her group has developed an app for smart clock, which was stopped after three years by collecting millions through Kickstarter's crowdfunding project.
After Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
She quickly adapted the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
"We were not blindly convinced that the Pebble clock would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We accumulated knowledge and were ready when smart watches were released to the mass market."
The island of Sulaves was destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami
On Friday, 29 September, a powerful 7.5-point earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulaves, causing a tsunami and killing almost 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is expected to rise.
According to the representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, electricity and communication are not working and it is therefore difficult to assess the damage in Palu and in the nearby fishing community in the Danube.
The California students were wearing a T-shirt with racist inscriptions
As reported by CNN’s KGTV branch, the Escondian Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had made a well - thought - out decision to demonstrate racism at a high - grade event.
"We are proud that our school accepts everyone and is fearless of diversity," said director Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by the Escondian Secondary School, Union officials and local police.
"The school administrators contacted the parents and guardians of the wronged pupils and will be subject to disciplinary penalties," says the report.
According to a report from the police station, students of the school north of San Diego were wearing t-shirts with letters written against them and photographed when they were worn.
Usually the school confirms in advance the inscriptions, but after taking an official photograph, some students choose their words.
The Union report states that such behaviour "is incompatible with the culture, values or history of the Escondide Secondary School".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Escondido Secondary School will continue to foster family values and a culture based on unity throughout the community."
The former student, Cade Pannellas, told the KGTV that he was angry with an insulting picture in the social media.
"This has offended me personally," he said.
“Maybe it seemed funny to them, but it’s not.
Only unwise people can laugh at such things."
Shareef, son of Shaquile O'Neal, waiting for heart surgery, will spend the 1st UCLA season
Shaquile O'Neal's son Shareef, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, will have to spend the first UCLA season due to heart problems.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will undergo heart surgery to eliminate a disorder that UCLA doctors have noticed during a routine examination.
"Thanks God, UCLA doctors noticed the problem early," O'Neal said to TMZ.
“As long as rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and I will be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed the official letter of intent in August, promising to play in UCLA team, which has already attracted a number of famous names and is one of the best first-year teams of the country for the 2018-2019 season.
"Shareef has improved significantly in high school," said the Chief Trainer Steve Alford of Bruins last month.
“He is tall, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of a new team.
We are pleased with the composition of this year's team, and Sharef will complete it perfectly.
He has a good foundation and will be able to improve on both ends of the court."
According to 247Sports, O'Neal is a four-star candidate at the age of 18, and in 2018 newcomers rank 8 as a heavy attacker and 41 as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neal's last season helped Crossroads to achieve a record result – 25:9.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is accused of violence against his father
In 28 C.E., Track Palin was arrested for three offences, including an attack.
On Sunday, he was arrested for several times for domestic violence.
According to the court records, the incident occurred at the Palinian home in Vasila, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father, Todd, in a bloody dispute over the truck.
28 years after the Saturday incident, he was arrested for three offences, including an attack.
The court records indicate that the dispute began when the man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it up.
As explained in the court statement, Trackas Palin was arrested for charges of first degree invasion and fourth degree attack and fourth degree criminal offence, and his father was injured in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called the policemen who spoke him "the pranks" and ordered them not to use weapons.
The statement of the court also states that the man has climbed the garage roof before being arrested.
Sarah Palin's words in court documents that her son was "agitated" and "used some medicine".
It was also recorded that Track Palin told the police that he had taken several bottles of beer in the past.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol.
"Seeing how my son feels, what he's going back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know what soldiers return to be injured," said the former Republican candidate for Vice President and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I understand better than ever that the best American leaders need a chief executive who respects and appreciates them."
Elizabeth Warren claims to think about standing for President after the mid-term elections
"The time for women to march to Washington and correct the failed government that the woman has to lead," said the senator of Democrats speaking to the crowds who met at the Holjok Town Hall of Massachusetts.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, think carefully if it is not worth standing up for President."
Warren, who tried to defend his position in a competition with the Republican representative in the state of Geoff Diehlu, said earlier that he would not stand for Presidents because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and to stop acting as if 2020 were the only important thing," she said when she spoke to the reporters in August at the National Press Club.
"The closest important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts but also in the whole country."
Warren has long been regarded as a potential candidate for the 2020 Democrats, able to compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would be waiting for a difficult initial election fight, where other prominent democrats might participate – former Vice-President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Third obsessive death in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person committed suicide in a luxurious psychiatric clinic less than a year ago.
Shaquelle Vidal, the daughter of the television comer (23), died on 7 April and spent almost a month on a voluntary basis in the Nightingale hospital in West London, Marylebon.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57 years) – the manager of the hedge fund, a millionaire and a former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid her care expenses for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the day when the celebrity of the high society day Boyd (28 C.E.), Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe, died.
After the separation of the heir of the publishing company Dan Macmillan (43), D. Boyd died on 5 October under the influence of cocaine, which was illegally brought by a clinic visitor.
Two months ago, Alan MacDonald (61) left his life when he was released from the hospital four days ago.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not make enough efforts to prevent illegal substances being introduced.
The daughter of Avo Vidal from the BBC series Mock The Week was registered at the Shaquelle clinic on 11 March.
Last week, at the preliminary coroner's court of Westminster, Royal lawyer Katie Gollop said that Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL on 29 March and returned to a deteriorating mental condition a week later.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, who she talked to and what she did."
Mr. Lyle, she called Shaquelle "a boy."
John Gordillo (52 C.E.), an informal parent of Shaquelle, said: "I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at that time."
Mr. Gordoll's meeting revealed that on April 4, Shaquelle called him and told him he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called the clinic "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after the call, but no one responded.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if someone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinic doctor found that Shaquelle's mental condition was extremely poor."
In less than 48 hours, she had a notebook cable.
In Nightningale, the representative expressed condolences to family and friends and said: "Our clinic aims to provide high-quality care in a safe, treatment-friendly environment."

Led Zeppelin has been brought back to trial for alleged stealing guitar reef of "Stairway To Heaven"
Led Zeppelin was brought back to court for the guitar reef used in the 1971 song "Stairway To Heaven", which the group allegedly stole.
It is said that some of the British group's hits in 1971 have been flattened.
The Court of Appeal rejected the judgment of 2016 that the group did not copy the name of another group "Spirit".
In 2015, Michael Skidmore, the attorney of Spirit guitarist, filed an action.
It seems that the trial of the Led Zeppelin song "Stairway To Heaven" will last for a long time – as well as the song itself.
The group will be brought to justice again for charges of stealing the 1971 ballade guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the judgment of 2016 that the group did not copy the beginning of the hit from the music of the group Spirit.
It is claimed that the judge has made mistakes, for example by falsely informing the jury about copyright laws.
The case has been referred back to court.
Michael Skidmore, attorney of Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, filed his first claim in 2015.
Police Captures in Michigan ended when the policeman crossed the suspected murderer who shot them
The suspected Michigan resident in her girl's murder was arrested after the police were caught, which ended when the police car crossed him.
It is suspected that Adam Nolin shot his girl on Thursday, 33, in Michigan, in Wyoming, – 27, Tia Mae Randall.
He was brought to court on Friday at the hospital, where he found himself in a police car in SUV, because Nolin was shooting at the police to try and escape the highway, where he was on intensive traffic.
Nolin has been accused of five serious crimes, including an attack to kill and escape the police.
"Surveillance is not a normal case, but it is not the first such case," said the master of Wyoming's police, James Maguffee.
"It is subject to the necessary treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
The judges often adapt so that this can be implemented."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile house in the district of Creekside Estates.
The mother of two children was shot with a single shot and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Then the police published a public warning about Nolin and gave a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge pickup.
The man was noticed in his pickup and went to the highway US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and the pickup hit the concrete wall, then got out of the car and ran off the highway.
As he ran, he shot at the cops.
One policeman sat in a SUV police car and drove Nolin from his back.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin was taken to the hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until he was released and transferred to Kent District Prison.
"This event showed that Western Michigan policemen risk their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffee.
"They arrested a man quite quickly and by appropriate means, and we are very proud of them."
In total, two charges have been made against Nolin in order to kill him, and he is also accused of fleeing the police, carrying a hidden weapon and a serious crime committed with the use of a firearm.
He's not yet accused of murdering her girl because the investigation is still under way.
"Of course, we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will be completing soon so that we can submit it to Kent's regional prosecutor on time," said Maguffee.
The judge commended the brave man who had shot his teeth into his house to an intruder
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for the courage of a man who stood against two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one hacker tried to bring him a wooden board, David Oldham was not afraid in 63 C.E.
A man working as a university overseer protected himself, struck both criminals, and kicked one’s teeth.
The invaders fled, but after the battle, there remained blood on Mr. Oldham, according to which after four months Craig Ford was found and arrested.
Clement Goldstone, a royal judge, said: “You probably didn’t expect this kind of reaction from Mr. Oldham when you hijacked to see only the eyes and the nose, he hit him at the house.
He also struck your associate, who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
When the judge sentenced Ford to three years and four months on Friday, he said: “I hope you learned two lessons.
The first is not to irritate David Oldham; the second is not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you are bitten by a dog.
It's still a little punishment."
He added, "I would like to commend Mr Oldham for the way he responded to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones stated that the Ford who committed the crime had already been convicted of another invasion in 2016 and had to be imprisoned for three years, but was released on a parole basis.
Mr. Oldham told Liverpool's royal court that he had danced when he heard a noise near the house about 19.00 on 5 April.
Jones said: “Mr Oldham, who is a rich man, has courageously left the house and resisted the accused against him.
Fearing his own safety, he struck him in his face, thus striking him and striking him out his tooth.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit his face."
According to Mr Jones, the associate took a wooden board and tried to sniff Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Shoot him, he beat my teeth."
The associate said to Mr. Oldham: "If you let us go, we will go," and together with Ford fled the crime scene.
On August 2, the police caught Ford in the house in Wavertree.
Ford kicked the police dog, and he bit him in his shoulder.
It is believed that the second hacker is still in freedom.
Ford, who has no permanent place of residence, admits to be guilty of hacking, beating and dangerous driving, although this is prohibited and does not hold a driving licence.
Thoric activists met Johnson with criticisms
The Tori activists today humiliated Boris Johnson, who was called a "little and aggressive man".
Mr Johnson, trying to please ordinary people in his uncompromising talks about Brexita, received a rigorous assessment from former Trade Minister Digby Jones, which was also endorsed by the participants of the Birmingham Conference this afternoon.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he cares about newspaper headlines and not about strong politics.
Speaking with MailOnline, Mr May's ally added to the Cabinet of Ministers that he was simply "noise" because he couldn't be a full leader.
The opposite reaction was received when the former Foreign Secretary once again attacked the plan of Prime Minister Chequers and called him "insane" and "absolutely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and here she was opposed to withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May retorted that her critics were playing political games and argued that she was not problematic and prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview conducted by Andrew Marro BBC, which opened the Torus Conference, Mr. May said: "I believe in Braxita".
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, now acting independently, received the approval of the crowd to praise Braxito's prospects.
People shouted when he expressed his opinion on Mr. Johnson, who supposedly answered the questions of businessmen who were concerned.
Without specifically mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he is a "little and aggressive man".
"Business is very important, therefore, saying "false business", former Foreign Secretary showed that there is actually a small and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also praised the reaction of Mr May, who had attended the meeting of Salzburg leaders, to the EU leaders' "axles" on her office plan.
Ruth Davidson, the leader of Scottish tales, also criticised Mr Johnson earlier, recalling that he was a high-ranking government official in the Braxito negotiations.
Mr May's ally said to the newspaper MailOnline in the Cabinet of Ministers that intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough supporters among the speakers in the parliament to be able to drive the Prime Minister.
They said: “This news is not very dangerous now.
He's noiseing, but he doesn't have enough supporters in the parliamentary party, and he knows it himself.
We see a clear contrast between David Davis, who has expressed his opinion respectfully, and Boris, who has met his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked entrepreneurs who were sceptical about Brexita.
Speaking at a conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said that Mr Johnson was "absolutely wrong".
He said: “I am surprised that someone can think so at all.
There is no successful economy in the world without successful companies."
In an interview with Sky News, "Ridge on Sunday", Mr Davis admitted that the coming months would be a challenge because the EU would try to make the United Kingdom give a lot of relief.
He believes, however, that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr Johnson succeeded in leading the Tori, he did not miss an opportunity to enlist the former Foreign Secretary.
Despising Mr Johnson's proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of British politics is that politicians have fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas are right for headlines, but not firm for politicians."
Bulgaria spent 80 million pounds of European taxpayers' money on bad restoration
Bulgaria spent 80 million pounds of European taxpayers on the poor restoration of ancient castles, which now seems to be built from cheese and cardboard.
The Balkan country spent £80 million on the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the former majesty, the restoration became detestable.
The local authorities in the area near Krakra have promised to redesign the wrong works.
The Bulgarian Government has spent tens of millions of EU castles in an intrusive way for the restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan country spent £80 million on restoration of ancient castles and fortifications from the European Regional Development Fund, but instead of returning their former greatness, it was a shame for construction work.
Relicts after expensive reconstruction look like they're built from cheese and cardboard, so they're no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, monumentists were furious that the Western Bulgarian city of Pernik in the Middle Ages fortress Krakra and the Roman fort Trayanovi Vrata near Ihtimano had been reconstructed using polymeric concrete, which was commonly used to build the floor.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have agreed in private that lessons should be learned from this failure.
"Strengthening is in a bleak state," said the architect and monument conservationist Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
It has survived 16 centuries and is now damaged."
This reaction was received after the restoration of Krakra fort in Pernik, therefore the local government promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
The Pernik Fortress has been called "a castle from the cardboard" due to false modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata Fort is named after the cheese fort, because it has been restored from smooth white blocks that are not suitable for the weather-hit facade.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with the new doubts about how the European Union uses development funds.
A crowd of stylistic bikers on the way to this year's event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of stylish costumers from all over the United Kingdom landed on the streets of the Vintage motorbike in order to collect money for the Movember fund.
The event is called the "Military gentleman's trip" and is organised every year in order to collect money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year the bikers gathered in London and 40 other places in the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" takes place in the UK and 650 other cities around the world and has so far managed to collect more than $5.5 million ($4.2 million).
The official website of the event says that this year 120 000 people were "made of ties, tie ties to ties to ties, levelled up the tweezers, sat on their classic and vintage-style motorcycles and allowed them to raise funds and raise awareness about men's health, namely, prostate cancer and mental well-being".
The event “Distinguished Gentleman's Ride” in Sydney, Australia was organized for the first time by Mark Hawaii.
The idea was inspired by a photo by Don Draper, the character of the series “Mad Men”, in which he is sitting on a classic motorcycle dressed in his best row.
This year, hundreds of bikers were driving through the Tower Bridge in London, including Sergeant Pepper, a beautiful taxi dog.
Tennis sharp Boris Becker revealed that he had been treated for skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors who had successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker's photos barely show a small patch on the sunglasses.
"It was a routine test and it looks worse than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
When he discovered that he had been treated for skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Becker was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday he published a Twitter message about his health in German: "I want to thank Martin Mayr-Brune and Dr Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
On Sunday's 50-year-old photos barely show a small patch on the sunglasses.
"I visited a dermatologist on Monday who removed my basal cell carcinoma," said Becker to the German publication Image.
"It was a routine test and it looks worse than it really is."
Basic cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
There is a high probability of recovery when it is set in time.
Becker is currently different with his wife Lilly Becker (42), and they reported on divorce in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and the Olympic gold medal in two matches.
He was recently observed as an entertainer with his friends in the 185th Oktoberfest in Munich.
24-year-old hammer meticulous attack on the platform of a stranger train due to body volumes
On the train platform, the British Athlette, who was attacked by a stranger because of body volumes, decided not to shut up.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal at this year's British Athletic Championship, says he was attacked Friday afternoon at the Lyds Station.
At the age of 24, and at the height of five feet, 11 inches, Mr. Mayho said that while waiting for the train, she was driven by a man who was insulting her words.
About 17.00 a.m., a man who attacked the atlas called it "stora".
However, the rising sports star, seeking place in the British team at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, has turned aside for his husband.
Says Mr. Mayho, who came from the city of Kitty, West Yorkshire: “I was defending myself until other people turned their eyes on a full - time platform.
Such people may be frightened and distrusted, but it's my body, my "mechanism".
Having announced her adventure on Twitter, the young athletes received great support in the social media.
Andy Lewis, the cavalier of the MBE Order, wrote: “Stra!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jesse. It's okay with you.
Don't let a big-headed idiot spoil your mood."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm disgusting.
Not only because of him, but also because of those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example for the new generation.
You showed that we should be proud of ourselves, and dissatisfied can get off!"
At Lyds University, Mr. Mayho's hammer throw was interested in teen years, encouraged by one of her senior sister's coaches.
Since then, she has been able to win second place at the Muller British Senior Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championship medal just a month after she won the North English Games.
Athlete refused to comment on the event in more detail.
When accounts of at least 50 million users are broken, Facebook will have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion
Using the security gap, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large-scale hacking was reported only after three days – Friday.
Now Facebook is at risk of a huge fine under new European data laws
If at least 50 million accounts are broken, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to access accounts because of the security gap, which allowed for the disclosure of a large number of sensitive personal information.
However, Facebook only announced the hacking on Friday, three days later, and it was not possible until yesterday evening to tell how many British accounts were broken.
While the search for apps is ongoing, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of the web giant with European data requirements, whose headquarters are located in Dublin, criticised the company saying: "The notification is incomplete".
Facebook is at risk of a huge fine under the new data laws of the European Union, as companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of world turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned 31.2 billion pounds of revenue.
Criminals have reached their accounts using the Facebook function View How, which gives users the opportunity to see how their profiles look to others.

In the MG Baltic case, the recordings continued: the accused discussed Gabriele Landsberg
The hearing started with a hearing between Raimondas Kurlanskis, former Vice-President of MG Baltic and Vytautas Gapsis, former "worker".
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what those who are currently accused are talking about.
It is true that the record hears that R. Kurlanskis and V. Gapsys speak about Christmas celebration, and several times the name of the current conservative leader Gabrielius Landsbergis sounds, but it is difficult to understand exactly what is being said.
Indictments submitted to both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, accusations have been made against three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberals Movement parties, MG Baltic concern, former leaders of liberals and "workers" E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapsius, former MP Š. Gustainis, Member of the Seimas G. Steponavičius, and former Vice-President of MG Baltic R. Kurianskis.
The labour party was suspected of bribery and trade, the Liberals Movement is suspected of bribery, trade of influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and trading of these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians took or consulted on bribes with the then Vice-President of MG Baltic R. Kurlanski, and subsequently proposed or supported group-friendly initiatives in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former Chairman of the Liberals Movement E. Masiulis is suspected of trade influence, bribery and illegal enrichment, the former Vice-President of this party G. Steponavičius is suspected of abuse, and former member of Vilnius City Council Š. Gustainis - bribery.
Mr Gapsys is suspected of having a bribery and trade effect, Mr Kurlanskis of having a bribery and trade effect.
Survey: Who has the greatest chance of winning the second round of presidential elections?
The survey on the second round included four candidates at the top of the ratings – economist Gitanas Nauseda, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, and two candidates of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) initial elections - Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
It turned out on Sunday that I. Šimonytė received support from TS-LK in the elections, and V. Ušackas withdrew from the electoral struggle.
As data shows, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second round of the President would win Mr Nauseda, but the head of Vilnius, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Separate (from others - DELFI) Nauseda, but it is very important to watch whether about parties talking or about people, what is the dynamics.
This double of Shimonytė was from one study to the next, and the nausea had stopped growing, and Ušack was even decreasing.
This growth is very important for you", says the sociologist.
In addition, looking at the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or are thinking of not going to elections at all.
If Mr Šimonytė and Mr Skvernelis were to fight in the second round of presidential elections, the fight would be tense: 32.7% for Mr Šimonytė, 30.9% for Skvernelis.
It is true that 36.4% of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who they would vote for or would not vote for the elections.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that we are not yet full of the picture, because all candidates who applied to a less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been announced.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the candidate for Social Democrats? 30 years has been a candidate, will it not be?
When he announces, he will see how his opportunities with other candidates are being discussed.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful, is less reflected so far," said V. Gaidys.
Mažvydas Jastramskis, political scientist at Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected V. Ušackas who have left the fight seem to be quite equal.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not show any advantage for any candidate.
The only thing I could see is that Nauseda would look good against Ušack (...) again, bearing in mind if those people came to vote in real terms.
The nauseda against Squirrel also looks good, but we compare now apples and potatoes because, for example, Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, Squirrel has not announced.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the initial elections of the Conservatives, what would it look like after them?" says the political scientist.
According to him, Mr Nauseda has a small plus, but once all the candidates have been declared, he may melt.
"The situation is quite equal.
Nauszėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results approximate.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential elections, Rolandas Paksas had 5% support for voting in favour of him and then won the elections.
No predictions can be made," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI reminds that economist G. Nauseda, Member of the Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of the Liberals Movement Petras Auštrevicius, Member of the Seimas Naglis Pueikis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis has already declared candidates for presidential elections.
Iran blames Israel for attempted cyber attacks
"The regime in which the history of the use of cyber weapons is clear from cases such as Stuxnet (computing the virus), this time tried to violate Iran's communication infrastructure," said the Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azari Jachromi through Twitter.
He was referring to the attack on the Stuxnet virus in 2010, which has damaged Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have developed this malware programme.
"For the attention of our technical teams, they remained empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international fora", stressed Mr Jachromi.
The Deputy Minister Hamid Fattahi said that the technical team recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems on Monday mornings, but the attackers were given a "solid answer".
The health club “Impuls” has become bad for a man, his recovery has failed
The disaster happened about 10.40 a.m.
A man who sailed in the pool (born 1945) suddenly got sick and immersed under the water.
The man was quickly taken out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
They tried to refresh him.
Soon, emergency doctors tried to refresh him, but they failed to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in an emergency car.
This disaster was commented by the head of the health club network "Impuls" Antonas Sakalauskas.
"In our data, 73-year-old husband and his wife visited our wellness club in Fabijoniškių g.
The client sailed in the pool for about 30 minutes, then sailed to the pool track to rest and suddenly collapsed in a few minutes.
The people who were nearby - the client who sailed on the common path and the pool supervisor - immediately responded, pulled it out of the water and began to recover.
The man was constantly revitalized until the ambulance arrived.
The club staff immediately called an ambulance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctors arrived, they restored the man’s pulse and breathing and transferred him to a medical car.
While at the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilise the man’s health. Unfortunately, after 20 minutes, we received information that the man did not survive.
We express our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased man for his loss.
Preliminary data suggest that the incident may have been caused by the client’s health problems.
According to the information provided by family doctors, he has had diabetes mellitus.
We remind you that if you have serious health problems, it is always very important to take a responsible look at your options and consult doctors and health club professionals.
There is a watch-keeping supervisor in all health clubs' swimming pools, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and it is distinguished by bright clothing from other employees.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations capable of immediately contacting the administration and the registry, replying to requests from them or inviting assistance.
Staff training related to the security programme is carried out four times a year - much more frequently than required by law.
During these periods, staff shall develop theoretical and practical knowledge, shall be trained on how to deal with an accident, shall be monitored for proper compliance with procedures and internal procedures.

According to LNK's press release, four years ago Lithuanians lost their right to care for their son, and it is seen with the decision of the Norwegian Child Rights Service Barnevernet and courts.
The story of a woman caused almost an international scandal followed by the whole media.
Nationals have prepared pickets for the return of the boy to Lithuania for his grandmother both in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity to the Greeks and her family did not help to regain a son with Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, a woman tells us how she has been separated from her son for the last few years, and how her and her child meet after two years of break.
At the time when Gražina lost her right to look after her son, the boy was 8 years old, today is 12 years old.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw her son, it was banned.
Later, the Beauty was given the right to see his son twice a year, just one hour later.
During the last hearing, which took place several months ago, the number of dates for Lithuania was increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with his son every time remind us of a meeting in a prison of strict mode - watched by officials, and a trip to them - a secret operation.
"Sons changed even four families and no longer speak Lithuanian" - this Tuesday evening the heart will be opened by Gražina, her story - in LNK program
Eligijus Masiulis will not return the personal money collected through the search
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced its rejection of the accused’s lawyer’s complaint.
The order shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal.
In the case of political corruption, E. Masiulis, the former head of the Liberals Movement, was tried and applied to the Appeal Court for the repayment of any personal money - money taken from him and the money of his spouse from the search.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Masiulis during the search.
Such money shall be subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and shall be permanently extended.
The Vilnius Regional Court last extended it on 15 October.
E. Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to refund all the money - he seeks to recover EUR 800 from the spouse's wallet and EUR 690 from his wallet, GBP 130 from the United Kingdom, USD 1600.
The former politician says that the latter money was spent on the planned trip to the United States.
Mr. Masiulis’ lawyer Mindaugas Bluvas asked for this money to be repaid on Monday at the Appeal Court, because the spouses were engaged in well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.
"The decision of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and reasoned, there is no restriction on the more assets indicated in the accusations submitted.
It is true that the court has established that it lays the foundations for confiscation of property, as well as confiscation of expanded property," J. Laucius said at the court hearing.
On 15 October Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in the case of political corruption E. Masiulis.
This money has been found in search of the corruption of the former politician at home and in the car.
The Chamber of Three Judges stated that the case-file shows that property rights are restricted only to the funds that constitute the subject matter of criminal acts incriminated against E. Masiulis.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it should be concluded that the right of ownership of the accused person is not restricted in a disproportionate way or that the restriction is applied for too long," says the ruling of judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgitas Kolyčienė and Ugnius Trumpulis.
The judges noted that in the case E. Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, that criminal proceedings were large and complex, therefore in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the term of temporary restriction of property of the accused person.
The prosecutors claim that Raimondas Kurlanskis, former Vice-President of MG Baltic, gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiulis for making decisions useful to the Group in the Seimas.
Both defendants believe that the money found with E. Masiulis - EUR 90 thousand - was a loan from R. Kurianskis.
According to the data of the case, 242.4 thousand euros, 130 pounds of UK pounds and 1.6 thousand dollars were found in search of E. Masiulis.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
The former politician has said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are family money.
He also argued that there is no evidence that the funds were received in a criminal manner.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has announced that the accusations against E. Masiulis show that these funds could have been received by accepting a bribe of more than 100 thousand euros.
Law enforcement claims that the remaining cash collected through the search could have been derived from unidentified sources of income, not declared, documented and possibly not legitimate income.
In the case of political corruption, the accusations were submitted to three legal entities - Labour Party, Liberals Movement, MG Baltic concern.
In addition to E. Masiulis, the case was brought against the former "worker" Vytautas Gapsius, former MP Šarūnas Gustainis, Member of the Seimas Gintaras Steponavičius and former Vice President of MG Baltic R. Kurianskis.
Kurlanskis is accused of giving bribes to former parliamentarians E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainis and V. Gapsius.
The Americans record dangerous Russian fighter manoeuvres
During the 25-minute takeover, U.S. Navy said that Russian SU-27 rushed straight through the plane ahead.
The Russian plane passed through it for the second time, using the acceleration of gravity, and made a turn with the tilt.
The passengers reported that they felt the turbulence during the first approach and the quake during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to exercise in international airspace, but this interaction has been irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure safety and prevent incidents that are in line with behaviour, including the 1972 INCSEA Agreement, - said the US Navy in its report.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential collisions", notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but assured that Russian SU-27 kept a "safe distance" from the American aircraft.
Parents’ spending continues: extracurricular activity is limited to €50 per month
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Research", a survey carried out at the end of August revealed that one third (32 %) of parents spent less than 100 euros on "buying" their children of one school age before school this year, a fifth (21 %) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three out of ten (29 %) - between 151 and 200 euros, and a little less than five (18 %) spent more than 200 euros on preparing one child for school at the end of summer.
Parents whose children started to enter the first grade this year spent on average about 220 euros on their children's school basket, while other parents whose children have already completed the first grade allocated a lower amount of approximately 160 euros on average to their children's education.
However, as the school year rises, parents often have to share their wallet with children’s teams and co-petitors.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the cost of a unit may vary from 20 to 100 euros per country.
Parents with school - age children were asked to tell them what average monthly amount they plan to spend on the extracurricular employment of their one child.
A quarter (23%) of the surveyed children planned to receive up to 20 euros per month, another quarter (26%) said they studied up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocate between 50 and 100 euros per month to the child’s extracurricular employment, and a sixth (17%) said they were planning to provide 100 euros or more.
It is true that in Lithuania children of school age are allocated an informal children's education basket of EUR 15 per month.
However, this money can only be used for one unit, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
If a child attends several groups or if several school - age children grow up in the family, the cost of post-school activities may double.
As the marketing manager of the consumer loan company "Vivus.lt" Justina Ambrasienė says, saving children's teams to a low or middle income family, especially when several children grow up in the family, may become a major challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents turned their heads to get money for exercises, stationery, or new sports clothing.
Now the main concern is how to pick up children after school without spending a bunch of money.
We notice that parents' spending increases particularly in August, when it comes to preparing for the new school year, but it remains higher later than in the summer, as parents tend to invest in their children's employment.
Often, when they lack funds and evaluate their possibilities responsibly, they are determined to borrow and borrow", - says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunas is pleased by the fourth printed trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street exhibition "Atja senienas, žeļu žinios" - the old trolleybus, printed with a drawing and inscription "Sienographer's inscriptions" has appeared on the streets of Kaunas.
A new fun trolleybus was announced by Kaunas City Municipality.
"This old man "Škoda" has also changed her slightly boring green color into a much more colourful and brighter garment.
She is also a participant of the exhibition "Attenu de Atja, good news!" - writes representatives of the municipality at the uploaded photo.
Mobile street art exhibition "Atja senienės, žeļu žinios" is dedicated to farewell with old trolleybuses, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
As soon as next year, the old Skoda trolleybuses will travel for a well-earned rest, replace them with 85 newcomers and modern Solaris trolleybuses.
The portal reminds that the first trolleybus, printed with street drawings, went to Kaunas streets a month ago.
There are several well-known accents of Kaunas street art on the trolleybus – the grandfather's pipe and elephant.
A week later, after the first show, the second piece of Timomtie Norvila - Morfai, a street artist, came out on the streets of Kaunas.
The trolleybus features a funny yellow car, which is often called just "the beetle".
"I wanted to put the trolleybus.
This drawing looks very fun, especially because it matches the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn around, it seems that it is part of that car.
When we painted the wheels in white, we made them like a retro style, it sounded like a whole combination.
Until the trolleybus tyres were painted, they certainly didn't look so beautiful," the street artist spoke to the portal Kauno.diena.lt earlier.
And on October 27, the installed drawing lay on the third trolleybus.
It is printed with white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is shown one house of K.Donelaitis g., and on the right - central post office.
"Vabalas" is the sweetest thing I've ever seen," Morphs gave the third trolleybus a printout by artist Morph.

Kaunas Day reminds that last week Kaunas public transport company Kauno busai signed a 29.4 million contract with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A, which indicates that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
" Kaunas is investing the largest amount in its history for the renewal of public transport.
This agreement will allow us to replace the old "Škoda" brand trolleybuses that have served us for many years and offer passengers the most comfortable services.
New low-floored modern trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New equipment and parallel upgrades of the contact network and street repair will allow trolleybuses to travel more reliably, much faster.
And, of course, the trolleybuses of modern design greatly decorate the city", - said Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of Kauno Busai.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas next August, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited the mother of Markle to celebrate
Duke Meghan hit the British royal palace.
This is proved by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British monarch invited Dory Ragnand, the mother of the Duchess of Sasex, to her Sandringham palace, and the British media.
Even the parents of Duchess Kate have not been honored.
In Kate, parents Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have been invited only to traditional Christmas services with a royal family.
An unnamed source for the newspaper "Sunday Express" revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd is "the sign of the queen's respect for Meghan".
Doria, who was at the royal wedding in May, beat the queen in her peace.
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together also encouraged talks that Mr Ragland is planning a longer stay in Great Britain.
Guess she wants to help her daughter before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born a firstborn in the spring of 2019.
The "Women's World" exhibition in "Zalgiris" Arena and again will stir up
The 16th edition of the exhibition "Women's World" has made women look forward to the long weekend, because even four days of hottest news of fashion, style and beauty is already on 8-11 November in Kaunas Žalgiris Arena.
Over the years, we can see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means not a normal shopping, but a tradition of giving time to yourself.
Often it becomes a place for friends meetings and a reason to spend the day with a sister or mother.
Four days of the exhibition have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks, how to look glowing every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or try various procedures that stop the aging process.
All this and more, promises as many as 415 participants who will be waiting for visitors on all three floors of the Arena.
Seminars on beauty and health will take place for three days, and on Sunday the representatives of the beautiful sex will be able to hear advice to create an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women who turn around in business face marginal situations when stress starts to interfere with a stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason, the Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women's Network operating in them have born the idea of organising a conference "Business and Happiness. Without stress", where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, the exhibition is full of events for beauty masters.
Exhibitions will provide an opportunity to learn the subtleties of hair coloring and modelling from the charismatic duo - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas, created by the International Academy of Vinokurov & Friends, for two days.
The competition for the creation of a bride's character and the mastery of the fight "Art Battle" will be waiting for further development, which will not leave indifferent.
As if cherry on the cake will become a celebration fiesta "With birthday, Lithuania", where on the occasion of the century you will be able to see a show that has not yet been seen - from body painting to dance.
Another tradition of "Women's World" will not be forgotten – the latest collections of designers will be presented on Friday's "Fashion and Beauty Show" where the most stylish will be chosen.
Supporters of handicrafts will be welcome at the Dekostudija creative workshop, where they will be able to create original products for the interior of the house or to decorate gifts more interestingly.
The last day of the exhibition is especially welcome for all long-timers, because traditionally visitors will be delighted with the competition "World Long Hair LONG-HAIRED WORD 2018", where new records of the longest cash register are recorded every year.
Prime Minister: teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after introduction of a post-paid fee
Since September, the average salaries of the country's full-time teachers have increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It's still early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have full-time work - their salaries have increased by more than 117 euros on average", S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the Government on Monday.
He called the Lithuanian Education Workers' Trade Union (LVTF) plans to carry out a strike on ethical payment "democratic law", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the educational process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permitted, possible.
If it is thought that there is a need to strike, it is their right to decide.
Just don't want kids and students to suffer in this place again.
If a strike occurs, it must be carried out in accordance with the laws in force," said Mr Skvernelis.
In June, the Seimas approved the model of the basic teacher's pay, and it is introduced in stages from September.
The pay for teachers was replaced by hourly pay – the teacher's post is 1512 hours a year.
The working hours of the teacher are divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
The trade union led by Andrius Navickas calls this reform absurd, angry that it was adopted by the principle of a bulldozer and announces an indefinite strike starting on November 12th.
The ETS requires the immediate abolition of this 'minute' pay system and the introduction of an ethical model with a maximum of 18 contact hours per post.
It is also necessary to increase the ratio of the fixed part of the basic salary by 20% and to reduce the number of children in the classes.
Among other innovations, the introduction of a new methodology for allocating funds for training is criticised because, according to the trade union, there is not enough money for home training, classes to be divided into groups, qualifications, education aid, and classes in large cities as they were.
The Ministry of Education and Science has stated that the ethical training of teachers will allow to regulate teachers' workload and reward the school community for all their work.
It is envisaged that the teaching staff will be able to work for the community up to half of the total number of hours per year, for the first two years of work - up to 40% of the total number of hours.
The working time of teachers is set at 36 hours per week, of which no more than 24 contact points per week for compulsory subject(s).
In May, approximately half a hundred schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, and about 1 thousand educators contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the SALPS.
In total, there are about 53 thousand teachers in Lithuania.
Call for preparation: crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, said in an interview "Business position".
"To say that the crisis is already behind the corner, I would certainly not be able, but there are signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, next year we plan to grow by 2.8 percent.
The main message I would like to give to society and business - let's be ready for everything", said V. Vasiliauskas.
He felt that there was no one-size-fits-all crisis, and they needed to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis that took place a decade ago was that at that time the government thought that the revenue generated by the growing economy would be eternal and that expenditure was planned.
This led to a very drastic cut in expenditure in 2008 following the crisis.
Now, according to Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"Truly, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance differs.
We believe that we are already exceeding the potential and we need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V. Vasiliauskas evaluates the preparations of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis by 7 of 10 points.
According to him, the economy as small and open as Lithuania is heavily affected by external factors.
The current displacement of the great elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us.
We must therefore be very careful.
With little economy to say that we are dealing with everything, you can, but I do not believe it," V. Vasiliauskas said.
What are the future prospects for those who have taken on large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly set out a short-term strategy, and it is possible to expect interest decisions not before the summer of next year: "At present, one of the main objectives is to try to manage expectations".
The trend, which is most worrying to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a drop in the working hands in our country.
"The fall in the hands of the workforce is also a significant factor in the decline in economic competitiveness.
It is also a decrease in the number of bread eaters.
Migration this year has allowed to balance this process slightly, but it is not sure whether this is a long-term trend," V. Vasiliauskas believes.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance forecast that the country's economy will grow by 3.4 percent this year, and next year - 2.8 percent.
Swedish Conservative leader will try to shape the government again
On Monday, the President of the Parliament announced the second opportunity for the conservative moderate party leader of Sweden, who has been at the political impasse for two months after the elections.
The Balance Party of Ulf Christerson belongs to the Alliance of Four Centre Right Parties, which received slightly less votes in the 9th election of September than in the previous ruling coalition of the centre left.
It was difficult for both blocks to bring together the majority by refusing to negotiate with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origins are in the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by Mr. Kristersson to form the government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On October 29, the outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Loffven announced his failure.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, the Speaker of Parliament Andreas Norlen said that he would propose to the Parliament next week Mr Kristersson as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thus pushing the first vote since the beginning of the government formation effort.
"It is not clear in advance whether different parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as the Prime Minister," said A. Norlenas to journalists.
However, he stressed that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change'.
"The negotiations have to end," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is not yet clear, but Mr Norlen said that the 14th of November is among the possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of the Parliament may, four times, instruct a candidate to form a government with which Parliament would agree.
If all four attempts fail, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Christersson is the third test by Mr Norlen.
Some groups of Christian Democrats from the Moderate Party and the Alliance's partners are pressureing Mr Christersson to accept the support of the extreme right-wing Swedish Democratic Party, but he has yet to reject this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes in the elections and is the third largest party, has been ignoring all major current parties for a long time.
The ultra-rights party, which has successfully taken advantage of voters' anger over immigration since the arrival of almost 400 000 asylum seekers since 2012, demands influence in the decision-making process in exchange for support.
However, the Liberals and Centralists of the Alliance strongly oppose this idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP), with the support of the Greens and the informal left, has provided opportunities for cooperation between the blocks, but only if it maintains its post of Prime Minister.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
Afghan government delegation to participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul government delegation will participate in the international peace talks in Afghanistan in Russia this month, and officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban, for its part, is still considering whether to participate.
On Saturday Russia announced that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the 17-year end of the conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Afghan Government, responsible for reconciliation efforts with fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, and the news agency AFP was told by Sajid Ihsan Taher.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has avoided sending its delegation to this conference, which will focus on initiating peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials - said the representative of Sebagtula Ahmadis. - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Place of birth: (a) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (b) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, (c) Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan.
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
Pakistan, long-time accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, "will necessarily participate", said Muhammad Faisal, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request for comments.
The meeting in Moscow was originally scheduled for September, but was postponed at the request of Kabul to be led by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place at a sensitive time.
The newly appointed US Envoy for Peace, Zalmay Khalilzad, is trying to persuade the Taliban to agree to the conclusion of the war and is concerned that the multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine this effort.
One U.S. government supervisory authority last week pointed out that the Kabul government government in Afghanistan had weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba met North Korea's leader in Pyongyang
North Korea's leader Kim Chen Unas and Cuba's President Miguel Dias-Canel, both of whom hope to lift US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their countries' strategic relations, reported on Monday by North Korea's state media.
Diaz-Canel, who came to Asia to continue his first international journey after his arrival in power in April, came to Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong Unas met him at the airport, and the leaders came together to the city to greet the crowds.
North Korea's state media reported that leaders held talks in the state guest house Paekhwawon, stressed the general socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail, but they pointed out that the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
A meeting with Kim Jong Una could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to make significant progress on the issue of denuclearisation in North Korea are increasingly lacking.
Pyongyang, who recently also sought Moscow's favor in silence, strengthens the rhetoric prior to this week's upcoming meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo in New York.
On the weekend, Pyongyang criticised the US through his official media for its irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington also widely used against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has referred to the possibility of further developing the nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change course.
Sanctions are an important item on Mr Diazo-Cannel's agenda.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Diaz-Canel discussed an arms contract worth almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) with Russia and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military ties.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'acquisition into the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains valid.
The painful sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and the European Union were imposed due to annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diaz-Canel has to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He's going to visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
In the storage areas - cars unsafe?
On Saturday, the woman asked the police officers to find out about this fraud.
According to Klaipėdaian, in 2006 it was left to store the Hyundai Santa Fe branded car in the parking lot at the end of September.
The ad on the website she noticed on the 3rd of November.
It appears that fraudsters tried to sell her vehicle for EUR 3800.
According to the owner, the car could have been stolen.
A man born in 1989 tried to sell the vehicle.
According to the police, the person is not the owner of the court.
An investigation shall be carried out to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
According to the firemen, Sunday evening, about 22: 00 p.m., the fire arose on Bandužiu Street, on the seventh floor of the apartment.
There was a fire in one room's apartment with garbage and a sofa in the room.
The owner of the apartment was taken out of the apartment and examined medically, reported the police.
Burning and sanding objects are thrown out of the apartment through the window.
During the fire, the 7th floor of the stairs were smoked.
Record: At least 157 days of traveling around Britain
On Sunday, the British Athletic took off from the sea to the coast in England, which became the first man to visit Britain along the coast.
For 33 years, Ross Edgley, Ross Egel, spent 157 days in the water, over 15,83 miles [2,83 km].
He sailed six hours later, and he would spend the night on the support team’s accompanying ship.
The last mile, the sportsman overcame with hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He went to shore in Margheite in south-eastern England - this is where Mr Edgley started his journey on June 1.
The sportsman, who planned to take 100 days, said on the shore to the relatives who met him, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that he first felt relief when he went to the shore.
"I was very worried that my feet would not stand," said the athletes.
The world's open-water sailing association pointed out that Edgley had to face extreme weather conditions during this endurance test, supported by Red Bull's producer of energy drinks, and that jellyfish had to be stunned as much as 37 times.
The organisers declare that Mr Edgley has doubled the record of the longest sea-going voyages, which until now was 73 days.
He has also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southernmost and northernmost points of Britain - the Lands Endo Point and John O'Groups.
This distance was over 62 days.
The Secret of the Macabrys Kleboniskis Forest: One Suspect Already Detained
It was a terrible find of the passerby, because the man killed was not deep buried.
Only in these circumstances was the crime learned, because the murderer victim had no loved ones and had not been reported.
According to the original data, he was not too old to be an adult.
Like the suspects of his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested by Kaunas District Court for three months last week.
A second who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is hiding from the punishment imposed on him for another crime, is still being sought.
Until it is found, law enforcement officers are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: for my children I'd make a lot of peace
In the new rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" the ranks of the most prominent artists of the country are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the artist team, who has been entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a certain woman will play Juliet's babysitter.
Povilas Meškėla has also become an important part of the team, which will take care of the singers' singing.
"I think love stories have been created many and very beautiful since the times of Shakespeare, but Romeo and Juliet will probably always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built on various stages for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these buildings", says I. Valinskienė.
Although a well - known woman is well - known on the stage, has created a number of roles in various performances or musicals, the nanny hasn't been able to play for her.
"The time to play Juliet has passed," I. Valinskienė smiles.
- I'd probably be happy to accept this offer in my time."
True, the character of the nanny in the drama of V. Shakespeare is no less important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
It is not only a mediator, a helper - its way and tone of speech, a woman's attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the story more and different colors.
Besides, the babysitter is also important because she is one of just two women in the drama Romeo and Juliet.
"The character of the flower is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than you have is a fun part of the creative process.
So far I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that she would probably do the same for Juliet's babysitter.
- I think the nanny asked her heart.
Most women do this.
I'd probably do that too."
The legendary Kęstutis Ananelis rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is created according to the famous V. Shakespeare drama "Romeo and Juliet".
A work based on real facts tells the tragically completed story of the love of two young people - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of history is determined by the uncertainty of where the conflict between the families of young people - the Monteques and the Capulets - arose.
"All sorts of stories are possible all the time.
Parents who oppose the choice of children have always been and will be.
Only today solutions to such problems - more diverse, - asked if the history of Romeo and Juliet could be repeated today, says future babysitter I. Valinskienė.
- In the very name of my children, I'd be able to deal with a lot of things, as well as the weddings."
In the rock opera directed by the actor and director Ramūnas Cicenas, the main roles of the actor and director - Romeo and Julieta - will be performed by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis, as well as Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicenas, Mindaugas Paikisis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkunas and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest presentation of rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first legendary piece of new colours will be seen by the viewers of Vilnius Siemens Arena on 28 December.
The day later, on December 29, rock opera will be shown on Klaipeda "Svyturis" Arena.

Skamp presents a song whose video has already refused to be shown on one TV
The group "Skamp" this year, commemorating the 20th anniversary of its activities, has once again actively started to create music.
Having announced the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" taking place on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena, a known trio presents new works one by one.
This time, it's Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow and a brave video of the song.
"This piece is about love, so I thought that all kinds of relationships should be recorded in the video, regardless of age or sexual orientation," says Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any form of homophobia is not normal in 2018.
"We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer have to discuss this," says Viktor Diawara, who created music at the beginning of the year during family holidays in Israel.
True, this video "Skamp" has already managed to get negative reactions - he did not want to show one of the most popular country shows.
It tells us a lot about our society.
Television won't show you a clip, because it's where people kiss and it's not the wrong content for kids.
And the fact that at any time of the day TV can be set on the screen and other forms of violence are the right content?" - retortically asks E.Jennings.
The Erics annotate and Vilius Alesius: "We would like to see more people with hands and kisses, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We are raising children and want them to grow up in an environment where tolerance and bullying are as low as possible.
A new song and video we want at least a little bit to clarify the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the group Skamp has been known for its bold texts, which spoke on unpopular or sensitive topics.
The best songs of all groups - old and new - will sound loud and wide in the Skamp20 concert already on 26 December at Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It welcomes everyone with their families, and children under 10 years of age are free of charge.
At the clinics via the road - traffic accident: a man who was hit by a bike
A few minutes after 9 a.m. portal Kauno.diena.lt, the readers' information about police and ambulance crews travelling towards Kaunas clinics was received.
The consultation revealed the reasons for this uproar.
The Kaunas Police Watchman confirmed to the portal that a traffic accident occurred at the Cliniki viaduct located at the intersection between Utena and Aivenių Str.
During her visit, a car and a cyclist met.
According to Kaunas ambulance representative, a person who has been involved in the accident suffered by a bicycle.
Happily, there were no major injuries and open wounds on the body.
Victim medical examination at the disaster site.
Drivers report that this section of the road may be more difficult to pass as a result of an accident.
Presidency: LRT is not political property
While the Seimas intends to return to the consideration of the conclusions of the commission which has investigated the activities of the LRT, the Presidency fears that the ruling parties simply seek to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," said the President's adviser Mindaugas Linge.
However, pointed out by the adviser, it is now possible to see the opposite process.
"It is possible to see that this (political. - ELTA) influence wants to have more.
We are critical enough," said Mr Linge.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT commission operating in the Seimas are questionable and questionable legality, because they are peaceful to the independence of the broadcaster.
Although stressed by M. Lingė, it is necessary to improve LRT governance, this should be done with the assistance of experts and in search of specific aspects that hinder the smooth operation of LRT.
He stressed that already now international institutions emphasize that the activities of LRT should be supervised not by political institutions, but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission which examined the activities of the LRT.
This conclusion was highly critical.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT have been very sceptically evaluated - to reduce the powers of the Council and to link the terms of office of its members with the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In view of these concerns, the Union of European Broadcasters has expressed its concern.
In January the opposition group of Seimas Members addressed the Constitutional Court on whether the special parliamentary commission investigating LRT activities and finances objected to the Constitution.
Workers abroad - good news from R. Karbauskas
The Seimas began to consider an amendment to the Law on Declaration of Residence submitted by Ramūnas Karbauskas, an elder of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union Group, under which citizens who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania would be exempted from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
Following the presentation of the draft, 56 Members of the Seimas supported it on Tuesday, before there were nine, 25 Parliaments abstained.
After discussion in committees, the draft Seimas plenary sitting is planned to be discussed on 6 December. The Seimas has also decided to request the Government's conclusion.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation shall, by decision of the State Social Insurance Fund Administration Agency, be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Residents and working outside Lithuania, according to the data submitted and approved by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered to have left Lithuania.
It is about services that people do not use.
There is an additional possibility to capture the fact that a person has left", R. Karbauskas explained from the Seimas Tribunal.
Such proposed legal regulation, according to the conservative of the Seimas Member, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Part of Lithuanians living abroad abuse this," noted A. Matulas.
Social Democratic Algirdas Sys believes that in this way we are calling on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, the health system would be free of charge for smart people.
Following the adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, persons who have gone to live in other countries shall pay social insurance contributions there, no accumulation of debts, and the burden of administration of the debts of "Sodra".
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Residents’ Register of departure are charged monthly with compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, a debt accumulates.
Duonėla has been convicted of fraud but has been acquitted for counterfeiting
Vilnius Regional Court maintained its sentence for attempted fraud against former famous sportsman Alvydas Duonėla, but he was justified for forgery of documents.
On Monday, the court’s judgment was published immediately.
A. Duonėla has been sentenced to imprisonment for half a quarter of a year, postponing the execution of the sentence.
The multiple Lithuanian kayak rowing champion was sentenced to March this year by Vilnius City District Court.
He was sentenced to half a quarter of a year's imprisonment.
The Vilnius Regional Court, which examined the case on the basis of the complaint of the sentenced person, eliminated one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
A former sportsman will also have to pay almost EUR 760 to the Crime Fund.
The prosecutor's office accused A. Duonėla of falsifying a bill in 2013, by which he lent LTL 200 thousand (about EUR 58) to his former wife, Dalias Burokaitė, the dental office headed by him.
It was only in December 2016 that the couple learned about this when they received calls to cover their debt.
The former spouse said that she had never borrowed money from her husband for the needs of the clinic and that she had never signed a bill.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, the case does not contain objective data proving that it was A. Duonėla who recorded the data that did not correspond to the reality, that it was UAB "Dalecija" that owed A. Duonėla LTL 200 thousand.
Accepts the arguments put forward in the complaint of the sentenced person and his or her defender, and there is no objective evidence to support this in the case.
Having thus established that A. Duonėla only used a counterfeit real document for fraud and admitted that this feature - the use of a counterfeit document - is a constituent part of fraud (in the present case - attempted fraud), A. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proving that he participated in the commission of a criminal act," says Vilnius Regional Court ruling.
Firefighters led the cats buried in the land - they heard the raging three days
According to the fire rescue board of Kaunas County, the report was received that the cat was buried three days after the exchange of thermal pipelines.
When the firemen arrived, they also heard the cat plucking.
It was found that a few days ago there were repairs of the thermal track.
It is believed that two cats could have been shut down by burial under the overlay.
Firefighters unearthed a heat course at a depth of 1 and a half feet [1.5 m] and struck a space for cats to come out.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father would not be surprised by liberal protests against Kavanaugh
On Sunday, the son of Velioni Supreme Court judge Antonino Scalia told the agency Fox News that his father would not be surprised by the opposition of extreme forces against nominated judge Britta Kavanaugh, because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too interfering in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general, he would not be surprised by his noise about the nomination to the Supreme Court, because many people rely on the Roe v Wade case – at least the left says so", said Christopher Scalia, recalling the famous 1973 case, after which women's constitutional right to abortion was established during certain trimesters.
The Roe case, in one particular way, abolished the right of all states to regulate abortion themselves and some states, in response to this decision, immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that in Roe v Wade and other cases the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with during the elections and the legislative process," he added during his performance at Fox & Friends."
"In an attempt to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, therefore nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes regarding approval result in a more severe reaction, because judges take a role that belongs to the legislators."
The senator of Nebraska, Republican Ben Sasse, expressed a similar opinion at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are largely not accountable to anyone and leave the resulting bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, so judges have to take up the work that senators refuse.
The Capitol Hill police arrested and accused hundreds of protestors of unlawful interference in the candidate approval process.
When asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid the hostile reaction to unsubstantiated accusations of sexual misconduct he had committed several decades ago, Scalia said that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh shouldn't hold office in the Supreme Court, because on Thursday, during the Senator poll, the reaction was hot and sometimes insane, Scalia questioned whether all judges were in a calm character.
"Judges are often angry," Scalia said when she spoke about angry disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
“Truly, Judge Kavanaugh may have reacted more aggressively, but these were different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name from unsubstantiated charges."
On Thursday, in the Senate Court Committee, a majority of the parties (11 against 10) were allowed to take part in the vote of the Senate as a whole.
The senator of the Republican Arizona, Jeff Flake, declared at a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive voice to Kavanaugh only if the FBI were given a week to investigate the violations of the current alleged charges against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing and President Trump said that the agency has a wide range of powers and can question "whatever it wishes".
“Schiaparelli” ready-made clothing collection – fantastic clothing
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
Schiaparelli has tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothes and handbags.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli Shoe-shaped hat.
This time, an eccentric image of a long-standing fashion house appeared as very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find senses, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first composition in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched in podium according to music.
She and her friend El Salvador Daldi have come up with art and fashion, and now this idea has been taken over by Calvin Klein and Rafa Simons, who collaborated with the US artist Sterling Ruby.
The Sklando legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, wanted to put on a real mayonnaise before the demonstration, but he didn't get his approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is inherent in the history of "Schiaparelli", – said Bertrandas Guyonas, the director of the last three years, spoken at the Fashion House in Vandom Square.
By creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he based his friendship with Manas Ray and, in collaboration with My Ray Foundation, created clothes according to well-known works of art.
The famous picture of the artist's close eyes "Stikinės larasas" is shown on the shirts sealed with "Perspex" tears, while the red lips from "Observatory time: lovers" are pressed on the true silhouette dress with a collage using the silkography method.

One of Elsa's strangeness was the superstitious attraction to the letter S. Her brand colour – "Socking Rosary" inspired her perfume "Socking".
The first Guyon's "Schiaparelli" handbag with a key hole on the buckle is named "Secret".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 pounds.
Yesterday, a temporary shop was opened on the old left bank where the surreal side of the Paris Fashion Week was demonstrated and Virgil Abloh's carpets were available from the Ikea collection for 100 €.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young fans of Abloh were placed in a row on the quay, eager to buy one of his works at more favourable prices than his male clothing.
For Ablohu, this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one who has access to luxury fashion or furniture created by designers.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help to set up a conversation at the lunch table.
This is what the generation of the millennium thinks," he said recently.
The audience gathered in Marais district realized that this event in the garage would not be common when models began to drive through them on skateboards.
The collection of free colorful men's and women's cloaks by Andreas Kronthaler, the designer of Vivinna Westwood, was based on portraits of the skaters of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul.
Some women (and several men) who were wearing high - heeled sandals were riding on skateboards, but they walked on their own underwearing platform shoes.
After watching the show in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange cardigan bound through her waist, Westwood joined her husband on the podium, who gave her a flower bouquet.
Strong twin connection in photos
Peter Zelewski, who was born in Detroit and lived in London, was already established as a street photographer when he started taking pictures of twins four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and a person, I was always impressed by twins and their extraordinary connection, which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, according to him, "I acquired dependence after taking a portrait of the first twins and there was no way back."
In Zelewski's upcoming book "Twins" pictures and stories of 44 identical twin pairs will be printed.
This project is more visual, he says: "It's not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to take pictures of the powerful and sensitive portraits of people."
Caregivers expressed distrust for the trade union that negotiated wages
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, dissatisfied with the trade union deal with the National Health Service on salaries, expressed their distrust after the vote and accused her of distorting her claims for the increase in remuneration that was expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken following a lengthy debate at the Royal College of Nursing, when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, wrongly promised members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, when the 1% salary limit will be lifted.
Before the expected salary rise, the members became angry and forced Davies to withdraw from office, then submitted a petition and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which they expressed their distrust at the college council.
“A fair and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen,” said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal College of Nursing.
“ The vote is clear and the board and the management of the Royal College of Care understood the message sent to her.
The Council has already sought changes in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to and include Members' words; we will continue to do so."
The meeting will take place next week, and the members of the Royal College of Nursing are expected to leave.
"The basis of the care is trust", said the national health service nurse for the newspaper Guardian.
“The actions of the Royal College of Care Council have destroyed trust in it, so the Council has to leave.
I hope that she will act with dignity and listen to the request.
I wonder if other trade union members will also seek restructuring."
General Trade Union civil servant Rachel Harrison, at the National Health Service, said in August “Guardian”: “After receiving salaries, employees of the National Health Service from all over the country realized that they had not received the expected lift.
It made them angry."
Prior to the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Nursing admitted that it had made mistakes in the wage negotiations in 2018 and had been poorly informed about them.
However, it is also argued that the campaign of the Royal College on the abolition of wage restrictions led the government to abandon this restriction and to commit itself to a gradual increase of 6.5% in wages over three years.
The vote took place following an independent investigation which found that the College was inclined to step down in the negotiations, and Davies was accused of having under-estimated the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Nursing provided information that was not factually correct and that members were not able to make a reasonable transactional decision and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published contradictory information on whether all employees will receive 3% of the increase in their salary.
In a brief report before the college assembly, representatives were mistakenly told that "a 3% increase and a gradual increase in reform are planned".
In fact, salaries should have been gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest wage earners would have immediately received an increase.
"Almost all the information provided to members after the convention about the implementation of the transaction was false (mostly because of the attempt to simplify it)", said the representative of the electoral reform service that carried out the investigation.
"ERS considers that the differences between the current system and the proposed transaction were not explained in a clear and concise manner to the decision-making parties and that the main advantages, including the calculations of 6.5 and 29% mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly identified and therefore it was not possible to reach a reasonable solution."
The decision to express distrust was supported by 78% of the votes cast and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Care took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of Instagram's direct broadcast by trying to "bduct" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for having broadcast Instagram directly, during which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
At the beginning of the live broadcast, most likely filmed in Moscow (based on Lohan’s previously updated Instagram history), the actress suggested providing a hostel for the family, but the situation quickly complicated.
“Hello for everyone! I want to show you what family I met,” she said to the audience, “they are refugees from Syria, and I’m very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Come on, I'll take care of you," she said to her family before turning to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch the movies?
It'd be nice to watch a movie on TV or on a computer."
When the parents refused, Lohan responded with opposition.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything about them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them a home and accommodation, as I am now, you should meet.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't laugh with me."
When the family tried to get away from Lohan by going down the street, the actress followed her by direct transmission via Instagram.
“Look at what’s going on – it’s a child trade. You’re ruining Arabic culture.
You're getting kids, though they don't want to come with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now we're all seen by the world."
The broadcast ended with physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Videos were distributed in the social media and some users were interested in whether this could be treated as an attempt to abduct.
The Independent contacted Lohan representative for comments.
One third of Britons believe that they will never pay out all their debts
Almost a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts in life, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, whose results were disclosed only by The Independent, showed that the British, especially those aged 18-24, believe that they will have debts throughout their lives, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
Last year, a report published by the Institute for Fiscal Research indicates that students who have completed their studies remain in debt of around £46,000, while the poorest students remain in debt of over £57,000.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay their full debt and will therefore work under pressure for the first 30 years.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Statistics Department, the UK family debt is record-sized and the British spends an average of £900 a year more than they earn.
But is it worth worrying about this terrible statistics?
Is lifelong debt simply a new standard way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
Consider the example of cars that are another major purchase purchased after the purchase of houses (if such a success smiles).
This week Auto Trader predicted that in a decade all new cars will be bought for hire, which will be the usual way to buy vehicles.
Jeannie Boyle, director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner, believes that expectations have really changed.
"Today it is really normal to have debts: credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and quick credits have become popular," she said.
"The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debts."
Today, student debt and house price debt have become normal.
Moira O'Neill, head of the Personal Finance Department of the Interactive Investor, believes that the results may cause concern.
"If you borrow a huge amount, four or five times your income, it may appear that no additional debt will mean anything," she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts must think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It should probably not be surprising that the commentators of the financial industry have no doubt.
Brian Brodie, Managing Director, Loan Agency "Freedom Finance", says: "Schools are not taboos.
A loan for home repairs or a new car is no longer considered as a last resort.
Due to low interest rates, many people have helped save on fixed-term deposits, which generate higher returns, but less easily to achieve savings.
As a result, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with excellent creditworthiness assessments."
Richard Haymes, head of the financial problem resolution department of Equifax TDX Group, believes that such expectations – not to get out of debt for a lifetime – are a real concern.
He says: “In August, inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates increased, and wages increased only marginally, and many people are concerned about the decision to borrow without a realistic plan to repay their debts.
Our analysis has shown that the number of personal bankruptcies will increase by 17 percent this year, and the main factor determining this is record consumer borrowing."
Debt may not be a matter of concern while a person is working and earning, but it is not clear how lifeless debts will affect his or her well - being in old age.
A study carried out by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, in conjunction with specialists in lending funds for mortgaged assets from More 2 Life, showed that over the last four years, unguaranteed debt by people increased by more than a third, more than twice as fast as the country average between 55 and 74.
This age group usually borrows on credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than it earns.
Boyle added: “At age 55, more and more people choose to pay their pension debts, which will affect their life in retirement.
Most often, these are the only savings they "must" save.
In addition, people think that using their assets will pay later, but switching their assets to cheaper ones does not give them the money they expected.
If property prices fall, this situation will only get worse."
In half, Serena Williams sang I Touch Myself to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams has released a video where she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" with a naked breast covered with hands.
The tennis axis shared a video on its Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their breasts.
"This month I recorded The Divinyls' version of the global hit I Touch Myself to remind women to check themselves regularly," wrote Williams.
“Yes, I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to identify as early as possible is to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the I Touch Myself Project, which is implemented in honour of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women of her health first."
A project supported by the bottom-wear brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of Amphlett 53.
The video published by the tennis star on her Instagram account received more than 1.5 million reviews and praises from many fans for how the tennis player sang the song.
“The warmest wishes for this clip and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, it’s amazing.
20 years ago, I had breast cancer, and I found the nodule myself, even when the mammograms did not show anything.
It's just necessary to check.
Thank you for not afraid to leave the comfort zone – you are a true Goddess!"
For Berlei project I Touch Myself Project also released a new snake leather bra The Chrissy inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the bra will be donated to BCNA.
It is important to know what signs and symptoms you need to look for when examining yourself.
Signs of breast cancer are not only nodules, but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from the nipples, pitting of the skin surface, persistent pain or changes in the texture of the skin.
In addition, the swelling at the armpit or at the armpit, the swollen vein, and the pelvis may be a warning of cancer.
It is recommended that the breasts are checked monthly in women.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, it is recommended that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor considers that your symptoms need to be further assessed, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to quatto
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and actually tried to make fun of everyone.
The best jokes of the show are usually not related to a specific actual event – as is the new show called "Career Day".
The U.S. high school day, when students bring their fathers, is shown, and the teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) is reluctant to agree that his father, old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver) would give the speech.
Parnassus, who is a lazdele and whose megalomanic personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, the character Daniel Plainview, from the film "Bus Blood", is telling us how he managed the oil industry.
"I was born seven months early," says Parnassus.
“The incubator technologies were just invented, so I was placed in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones have not hardened, but my spirit is not.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who plays a teacher, are barely laughing and can't look at Driver.
However, the jokes of the “Star Wars” actor only get up and he starts to tell about the personal war with another oil magnata H.R. Pickins.
"I married your grandson!" he
"I filled her belly with my swelling seeds and ruined your boy – it's my final revenge, H. R.!"
In less than five minutes, Parnassus became the same memorable character of Adam Drover as Kyl Ren of two films.
"Be cursed, H. R.!"
Candrick's Lamar's songs leaked: eight unheard songs appeared on the Internet
It seems that a lot of Kendrick's Lamar's unpublished songs have been leaked.
On Saturday, eight unheard works spread across the Internet, whose parties were sung by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abi Soul.
It is not clear where the songs came from, and the name of the collection "Bad Kid Hill City EP" and the illustration of the cover (likely created by the fan) are not official.
It may be that only the demonstrative and incomplete versions of songs sounded as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Map City era, while Heroin, sung together with SZA, is more similar to the DAMN/Black Panther soundtrack.
The following songs are distributed in the kit:
Gang Mumber;
"The Only Nigga";
"Want In Life";
Loved Ones (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
Look Over Your Shoulders (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted the representative of Kendrick Lamar for a comment.

Site furniture in Kaunas
The site can be named representative home area, where we spend time with our friends, welcome guests, etc. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceiling decoration, the taste of the owners, appropriate furniture should be selected.
The website should not only be beautiful, but also comfortable.
The best way to help is to invite an interior designer who will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is recommended to first set the main point of the website, i.e. the object to which you will combine furniture and other details.
This can be a fireplace or other important website interior accent.
It would also be great to create a chat room where guests can communicate conveniently so that they are not prevented by furniture that is not locally located, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the arrangement of furniture must promote communication, unite people, not move them away from one another.
Do not push the furniture to the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance should be from the walls.
While the room is small, leave at least a little space from the wall, do not push the furniture right next to it.
If the room is large, leave even more space from the walls.
In fact, the greater the distance, the better.
Set up your furniture to create a balance
Consider various details that will be on your site. Size and location.
All elements shall be compatible with each other.
Site furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
It will revitalise the interior of the website, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become unsaponifiable.
We advise you to always consult interior designers.
By creating the interior of the website itself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk going to extremes: or you will create a boring interior because you will be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, choose inappropriately or over-exploitate by improvising.
Good lighting
This is a very important matter.
After all, different light reveals space in different ways.
The lighting shall be located at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, floor lighting.
The Public Prosecutor's Office appealed against the extenuating judgment to heads of the LCF
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office has appealed against the Vilnius Regional Court's decision to the former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
As reported by the Prosecution Office on Monday, the complaint indicates that Panevėžys City Municipality had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys with monetary funds.
In the pre-trial investigation it was established that in order to find an opportunity to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, in 2010 service contracts were concluded between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality.
The prosecutors state that the services which the Federation had to provide to Panevėžys City Municipality according to the said agreement were not planned and could not be provided, because the planned services had already received or had been financed by the State and sponsors, some of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid from other funds, and some of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoice was issued: money was transferred on invoices for events that had not yet taken place.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office states that it disagrees with the conclusion highlighted in the judgment of the court of first instance that the State itself obliged and commissioned Panevėžys City Municipality to undertake reconstruction of a private hotel, because there was no state obligation regarding a particular hotel, but the proposal was made to Panevėžys City Municipality to resolve hotel development issues required for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the court found it unjustified that the heads of LKF and Panevėžys municipality tried to fulfil the state's obligation without having legal roads, because the data available in the case showed that there were possibilities to organise European Basketball Championship group competitions in other cities, without prejudice to laws.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office, by appeal, requests the removal of the judgment of the court of first instance and, in this case, the adoption of a new – the conviction – judgment concerning seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court fully justified the Secretary General of the LCF Mindaugas Balčiūnas for all the crimes committed.
This case concerns preparation for the European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
The accusations against Mr Balčiūnas were made against abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecution Office accused M. Balčiūnas of having agreed with the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director of the Federation in his position as Secretary-General of the LCF to draw up, in the name of the Federation, the de facto documents for the execution of works which are incompatible with the reality - transfer acts and other financial documents included in the official accounts, as well as the accounts of services provided to Panevėžys Municipality LKF.
According to the data of the pre-trial investigation carried out by the officials of the Management Board of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevėžys City Council, the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be fraudulently and forged documents for the benefit of the LCF and later used to reconstruct the hotel "Romantic" of the company "Via Unica".
The head of this hotel Dalia Kuklerienė has been accused of bribery - it is suspected that she gave TV as a bribe to M. Balčiūnas.
All persons convicted of Mr Balčiūnas have been acquitted.
The accusations in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - as if Bermuda triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania from 1992 to now exceeded the total population of Alytus city and reached about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical workplace and its safety are clear, then the choice of working remotely - from home, public spaces or even other countries - becomes a kind of new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the creation of safety and health conditions for workers working at a distance from other employees of the company, the diversity of modern forms of work can raise a number of questions, according to the press release.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer shall pay 80% of the compensation for the first two days of unemployment and "Sodra" for the rest of the period.
If it is found that an accident occurred during the course of work, sodra compensates 100% of the salary from the first day of incapacity for work.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by BTA, it is clear that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur in the workplace.
In most cases these are various physical works where the risk of injury is higher: care is taken to treat devices or equipment, or to lose concentration or coordination.
However, the offices, which now concentrate on most of the most marketable, best-paid specialists, are facing their own challenges, which are created by the freedom of mobility granted by employers and especially enjoyed by employees", - says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of the Human Resources Management Department of BTA.
The legal acts in force in Lithuania recommend that the employee's duties and limits of responsibility be clearly regulated, and that the working time, place and functions be defined, as well as when forming a job remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during work or not.
There are certainly different situations and nuances, each case being dealt with individually.
Workers have also often heard that, for example, when travelling to or from work or when travelling to working meetings for accidents occurring, the employer is responsible.
However, there are quite a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate conversations, to clarify and to make it as clear as possible and acceptable to both sides what situations are actually considered accidents at work, and who will already have the status of household injuries," the specialist advises.
J.Krikščiūnė claims that nowadays, when the computer and mobile phone and a stable internet connection are often sufficient for the performance of work functions, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work that day instead of at home while drinking coffee in a coffee shop or in a park enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a job or not?
What if the hours in question are not in line with the agreement?
There may be really mixed situations, the circumstances of which are helped by an investigation initiated by "Sodra" or State Labour Inspectorate," says the specialist.
According to her, in financial terms, the main difference between the event at work and the event at home is the amount of the incapacity benefit.
J.Krikščiūnė admits that it was informal to hear unpleasant experiences when employers try to hide the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to contact doctors outside of work, take responsibility for themselves, thus penalizing them financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude towards an employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people mentioned above encourages the search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: it is also employer liability insurance for damage to employees, acquisition of accident insurance, disability insurance or even death insurance, as well as health insurance," says J. Kriščiūnė.
The mobile signature system is running again

This company reported the disruptions on Monday morning, the difficulties experienced by Bite, Telia customers and part of Tele2 users.
The problems were also recorded in Estonia, but representatives of "SK ID Solutions" could not comment on the situation in that country.
Polish lessons for Lithuanian rugby team
The Lithuanian rugby team, which is debuting in the European "Trophy" division, is currently struggling to align themselves to higher-level rivals.
The "Trophy" Division on the Old Continent is the third highest capacity after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 top-ranking continental teams competing here.
Lithuanians started the event in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.
Last weekend, the Lithuanian national team visited Lodze, where it was not equal to the Polish national team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although Lithuanians were self-proclaimed, fights often violated the rules, and Polish regbians broke forward with fines.
For 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes, the penalty strikes were implemented by Wojciech Piotrowiczius, who gave his own 12 points.
In the first deck, Lithuanians had to play for 10 minutes without Tautvydas Mazylis, who received a yellow card.
On the second floor, the guests held several attacks, but they were not able to finish them.
At that time, the Poles managed to break our defense.
The ball was pressed in the legible area by Mateusz Plichta and later by Krystian Pogorzelskis and Mateusz Adamskis.
In addition to several important rugbbiers, the Lithuanian team coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantage of the rivals and claimed that such matches provided a lot of valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and dominated in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to keep up with this game for as long as possible.
We have just risen to this higher level and we need to get used to it.
We won the first matches against the Czechs, but now we have met very powerful competitors and we have had to acknowledge their advantage.
The Polish team provided us with useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, standing at the Lithuanian team's wheel for four years.
The Lithuanians will play the next game in Trophy Division on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing in this division.

The Japanese Coast Guard is looking intensively for a missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the whole tiny island in the north of Japan in 2014.
Japan was very important as a small, meaningless and unworthy island, which was basically unsuitable for life.
It's so important that the territory it's missing is now under intensive surveillance - will it still happen?
Why does Japan need this island?
I don't know.
It is likely that ice and submersible landslides have gone through the island forever, even though it has only recently protruding almost two metres above the surface of the water.
It is almost certain that the island has simply broken, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared nobody knows exactly - it was so useless that no one too much it did.
Probably the first Japanese fishermen to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, because there are better ways to catch where fishing can take place and where Russia's controversial waters start.
That was what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of land was the most western part of Kuryl Island.
This island chain, which Russia calls the Kuryl Islands, and Japan the Northern Territories.
The conflict has continued with some such interruptions since the middle of the 19th century, but it was full of force in the 20th century.
While there are natural resources in these areas, Japan also historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The fact is that the Japanese have been studying these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to make a map, to undertake more detailed research, and to register a number of small islands.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin came to the country and that all the Kuril Islands came to Japan.
So these two states lived together until 1905 when the Russian Empire defeated Japan in the war against Sachalin.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Kuryl Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean large claims on the whole of the island, although there were first ones, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashi, Scottan Islands and Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, because the islands have been examined first and Japan has also belonged to agreements of 1855.
In 2009, Japan proposed that Russia share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the northern territories, but now that the island has disappeared, this geographical link is as if lost.
That physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters is missing.
This is a huge loss, which is why the island remains sought.
However, even if they are found in Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the simple definition of an island - it must be land.
This means a slight reduction in the territory of Japan and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
It's just interesting what the island's search mission expects - it's definitely not going to be lost or sailed.
Incredible drama in the duel of Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams
For more than a week we had to wait for the final version of judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian duels were held in Poland.
The four eyebrows won by Lithuanians as well as Poles.
On the other hand, the final outcome of the decisive due to the long-standing discussions between the judicial panel and the final decision of the competition secretariat.
The meeting of the national team began with the victories of Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) confidently 3:0 won Jakuba Surma, shortly after his hard fight, Edgars Kurdelis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radomirs Obrušniakas.
Then followed the victory of two masters: Damian Duracaz (up to 64 kg) 3:0 overcame Mantas Dužina, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 overcammon Banny.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned the weight to the Lithuanian national team.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartosz Golebiewski.
In the next fight, Piotras Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) over the third round, a clear balance overcame Eigyr Kasmote, and the result again became equal to 3:3.
In contrast, the brothers of Jocula were successful.
Robert Jokuly (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzey Colton, and Arvydas Jokuly (over 91 kg) had to acknowledge Adam Kulik's advantage in the first round.
Most of the discussions were brought about by the battle between Tadas Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski.
It is precisely because of its cross-border meeting that it took more than a week to announce the final result.
One judge gave the victory to the Polish, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical mistake the point allocated to the Lithuanian judge was counted to M. Soczynskis.
After a long dispute, the victory left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the Lithuanian-Polish national team meeting, the result at 10:8 (two points for victory) was won by the owners.
They managed to pay back to the Lithuanians for the devastating defeat of the previous match.
At the meeting in Marijampolė in 2015, Lithuanian fighters won five of the six fights and won the victory result at 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian national team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal against the Lithuanian boxing championship to be held in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
The country's priorities will be followed by the formation of a new Lithuanian boxing team, which will defend the country's honor at the World and European Championships next year.
How does the dog determine in what direction the man went?
You already know that the dog’s smell is particularly sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, some even recognising diseases by smell.
The trackers in the movies are well known, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction of the footprint owner?
In fact, this issue is much more complex than you think.
Tracking of feet consists of three stages - finding, direction setting and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide when to go.
After all, there's not a second between different steps, so their scent is not very different, is it?
Not exactly.
A study published in 1990 at Oslo University described experiments in which the dog was brought to an angle of 90 degrees to the path through which a person passed.
Tests are carried out on grass and on asphalt.
And in most cases, dogs easily set the direction of a person’s movement, even when he tried to mislead them by passing backwards.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference in scent between the adjacent traces is very small and decreases with time.
But scientists say it's not so strange - dogs could say, and which part of the foot hit the ground first.
This is because their smell is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by the areas responsible for smell (how our brain is dominated by the regions responsible for vision).
In dogs, the nose has 125-300 million odour receptors.
In general, dog smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different smells plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out similar experiments with traces left by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to track their direction.
This is because the cancer of a bike is not segmented as a trace of an ongoing person, making it harder to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not owners of the strongest smell.
This title is likely to come from bears.
The males of the white bear follow the ready - to - mate females hundreds of miles [100 km], while the brown bear smells the animal as much as 30 miles [30 km] away.
In private forests promise to regulate felling
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday in the Seimas about deforestation.
At the end of August, there was public displeasure about the forests crossing the Labanor Regional Park.
The felling of these forests was stopped for a month.
The Minister has acknowledged that studies of the crossing Labanore have shown that no gross irregularities have been committed.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced some restrictions, taking into account the work group's proposal to tighten deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation to adjust deforestation will be in place by the end of the year.
The aim is to apply the same restrictions that will apply to fellings in state forests and to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of how 170 thousand followers gathered
We need to give people what they want, and put what they want together in the LRT TV show "Cultured with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylist, she gradually brought together a great crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, you hit the taste of a person, you stretch to yourself, and over time you gradually improve that taste," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in her Facebook account - she has reached this number using a particular strategy: "In the beginning, you try to taste a person, stretch you to yourself, gradually improve that taste over time".
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims to be intolerant to uncertainty, therefore she shows her face as it is – authenticity and ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She notes that there is no longer any human culture on social networks, because many internees come to them in order to get angry with someone or to read comments from other humiliating people: "For example, as a teenager, there was a time when I wanted to jump with everyone and curse - I don't have that wish anymore."
"False life is the worst thing.
And there is a lot of this in social networks.
In Feisbuck a little less than an instagram," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says that she sends a specific message to social networks – it speaks about the emancipation of women.
It also advertises magazine production and sees creations in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know there's a lot of it.
I believe there is a lot of creativity in my work, just like vanity.
I'm balancing - it's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a fake life.
It is much better to give people what they want and quietly put what they want," says Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, well-known people suggested through life stories: to talk about backstages, failures, and life events, thus remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that Mr Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to all culture.
According to her, culture does not have the opportunity to do anything, to do no entertainment and to show real values.
"As a boring teacher against students, is there a chance?
If we don't find a way to present this art, advertise without advertising, we won't get out of it.
When we're real and we catch the reader, maybe something will change.
You'll catch one, two, three - and already addiction," she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared when the helicopter fell in Lituya Bay north of June
On Saturday, after the helicopter crash north of Jun, a search for three people began in Alaska.
One person was saved after Friday's disaster, while the other three could not be found.
The helicopter crashed near the Gulf of Lituya, northwest of June.
It was found that it was Airbus H125 on a long journey to Grand Preri in Texas.
On Friday, aircraft debris were detected 100 feet from the shore.
According to Associated Press, one rescued person was 14 years old.
Mild hypothermia has been reported, but no other problem has been reported.
Two adults and two teenagers were flying in the fallen helicopter.
According to CTVA, David King (53), Joseph Pepper (42) and Andrew Pepper (11.) disappeared.
It has been established that the Senior Pepper is the director of the Alaska construction company Davis Constructiontors & Engineers.
It's not clear what caused the accident.
The National Transport Security Council stated that an investigation had been initiated.
"Two adults and two teenagers were flying with a crash helicopter that was completely new – just from the factory –" says a coastal guard report according to the CCTVA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including operations in Alaska.
According to "Anchorage Daily News", family friend Jeff Brodsky said that his relatives "have not yet lost hope of a miracle".
With the help of a coastal protection helicopter, rescuers renewed their search for experienced climbers on Mount Nevis in Fort Williams, Scotland, on 17 February 2016.
On Saturday, three people disappeared from the helicopter accident were searched for in Alaska.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
President's adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on serious disputes between Judge Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accused Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was thrilled to reveal that he himself had been subjected to sexual violence and defended Kavanaugh against CEO Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge had been accused of sexual violence by ignoring the facts unfavourable to the accusations.
"I am very sympathetic to the victims of sexual violence and violence.
I myself experienced sexual abuse," said Conway at CNN Sunday's State of the Union.
“I am the victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our own behaviour."
Conway said that the news network should be ashamed of the comparison of Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to three to ten years in a prison in Pennsylvania.
Conway also criticised the Senate's Committee on Courts because he was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who had been engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to the people of the United States.
Survey showed that Kavanaugh and Ford testimonials divided U.S. society
The Americans disagree on the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford – the accused claims that she was sexually attacked by a judge when they were teenagers.
The number of people who think Ford or Kavanaugh is lying is almost the same: 38 percent of those surveyed say that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying when giving evidence, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Courts Committee heard both parties, when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed charges against the judge.
When the letter was published, both Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak against the committee.
When giving testimony, Ford stated that he was 100 percent sure that she was trying to attack Kavanaugh rather than another person at a party in the early 1980s.
In her emotional introduction in 51 C.E., she said that she felt a civic duty and could not remain silent.
"I'm really scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Kavanaugh, who denied the accusations of sexual abuse against Ford and two other women, said that "nothing was sexually attacked at high school, college or anytime later".
“Everyone has tried to find something that would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting,” he said.
"It's the simplest defamation of the last minute."
On 27-28 September, a survey carried out by YouGov surveying 2607 people was not surprising – the opinions of people who sympathized with different parties differed: democratic supporters believe more in Ford (73 percent), and Republicans believe in Kavanaugh (74 percent), although more Republicans believed in Ford than in Kavanaugh – Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
The founder of the "Body Worlds" exhibition, called "Doctor Death", wants to be cut and demonstrated at his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented plastic wants to become an eternal part of his Body Worlds exhibition.
Gunther von Hagens has developed an innovative method that gives the opportunity to demonstrate bodies, skulls and organs in an exhibition that has been around the world and has received both admiration and controversial assessments.
In 73 years of cancer, the man told his wife to plasticize after his death to become a permanent exhibit at the Body Worlds exhibition, which will be opened this week in London.
“In a sense, it will be the completion of his life.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to The Observer.
She said that the husband gave firm instructions on what to do with his dead body, and the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries should be rolled out and silicone injected into the body and placed in an appropriate position.
"He said to me, "Angelina, you can freeze me to 25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze."
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, and then I'll have to do it."
Then, ideally, he will join the exhibition at the London Pavilion next to other bodies that have stagnated in time in upright positions, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagens was famous in the United Kingdom for his autopsy by direct transmission of British television (the first public autopsy in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have attended Body Worlds exhibitions worldwide since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernal, said that 100% of the exhibits of the exhibition, covering about 28 000 square feet, were presented by people who " gave their consent because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help to see possible problems".
“We see and read so terrible things that we are afraid of death.
No one will escape it, death is common to all of us, and I think that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernal.
Ronaldo lawyers threaten court action for rape
The lawyers of the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo said on Friday that they would bring the German magazine, which had published the "visibly illegal" American claims that it had been raped in 2009 by Ronaldo, to court.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer at Ronaldo, stated in his statement that the article of the magazine Der Spiegel was "an unacceptable statement of private charges" and he will seek legal redress for the magazine for his client.
The application was sent to the agency Reuters by the company Gestifute representing Ronaldo in response to a request to comment on an article published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of Der Spiegel's statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Der Spiegel first announced charges in April 2017.
Ronaldo, one of the most popular athletes in the world, has won the title of the world's best player five times.
This summer he moved to Italy Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on Der Spiegel's statement.
The magazine announces that the alleged rape took place in June 2009 in the hotel room of Las Vegas, as was said by Leslie Mark Stovall, lawyer of Kathryna Mayorga, who made the accusations.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed out of court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for $375 000 paid by Ronald.
Stovall did not immediately reply to Reuters’ e-mails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls by home phone.
However, Stovallas told Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
The Mayorga magazine Der Spiegel was told that the contract no longer binds them, because she still feels the consequences of the night that she had been nine years ago.
"I have experienced serious crises", she said "Der Spiegel".
“And yet, the charge of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business, ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to test Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the #selfpub3.0 website explains for the first time how to join other business creators, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Orna Ross, the founder of the Union of Independent Creators, has already been recognised as one of the 100 most influential people in publishing, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why the creators should allow Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trends in consumption, such as the increasing use of personal brands, responsible consumption and mobile phone reading, together with digital publishing technologies, create a particularly favourable environment for the businesses of creators," says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers who understand the value of intellectual property.
#selfpub3.0 encourages developers to create several sources of pay through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
May be earned from direct sales, subscription models, concentrated assistance, widespread distribution models and other sources of income, such as online training and related activities.
#selfpub3.0 also encourages the distribution of books in various formats to the broadest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main objective of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage change of mindset and to learn to manage their creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not unduly transferred to another company, such as a specialised publishing house or a provider of independent publishing services.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods should be consulted not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; she also stressed that commercial and creative freedom ensures the true independence of the creators (as well as other people).
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book “Self-Publishing 1.0” describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme – the sale of books for e-book readers and phones in online book shops.
The new Self-Publishing 3.0 era is now starting, where independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organization that unites writers who produce books independently.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, to promote ethical activities, to help start-ups sell books and to encourage developers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian Government about the planned deficit
After hearing the populist government plans to increase deficit expenditure significantly next year, the Italian President and Central Bank President warned on Saturday that the country's debt must be kept under control.
The Managing Parties (the Five-Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League) submitted on Thursday evening a 2019 deficit proposal which would bring the deficit to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and would exceed three times the objective of the previous administration.
This report mixed the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and hit banks' shares.
Moreover, such plans are not consistent with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and supervises their compliance.
Addressing the audience in the Presidential Palace, which commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that, according to the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be controlled".
"We will thus protect our citizens' savings", he said
At a later conference in central Italy, the President of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, said that the country's debt could no longer be increased further, which is the largest of the European Union's major economies and amounts to 131 percent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investments and manage and reduce public debt," Visco said, according to the state news agency Ansa.
"The school must be consistently reduced."
The head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis replied to the words of Mattarella that the debt increased due to the strict requirements imposed by Brussels for years.
"Be calm, Mr President," said Salvinis in his statement.
"The debt of the state has been bloated because of the budgets imposed by the European Year. After all, we change our plans and strive for a better future and growth."
Earlier, before Mr Mattarella or Mr Visco spoke, the Five-Star Movement Commander, Luigi Di Maio, said that the money stolen earlier would be returned to the people's budget, but added that the government did not want to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The managing parties pressed Giovannis Trias, Minister for Economic Affairs, who was not part of the group, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media said that Mattarella supported Tria's unsuccessful attempt to keep the budget deficit below 2 per cent of GDP.
The Presidents of the Party and of the Central Bank shall not directly influence economic policy.
The President of the 77th century may reject the law and refer it back to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then re-admit and legitimise an unchanged law.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
The Indonesian Geophysic Agency withdrew its tsunami warning 34 minutes after its release, followed by a severe earthquake that sent huge waves to the northeast coast of the island of Sulaves, where hundreds of people died and thousands were homeless.
Car bilge after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
At least 384 people died during a 7.5 - point earthquake and a tsunami that hit about 1,500 miles (940 miles) from Jakarta, Palu.
The officials said on Sunday that the number of victims is likely to increase.
On Friday, many people gathered at the Palu Festival on the beach, which was hit by many dead waves of six meters (18 feet) high.
The Geophysic Agency BMKG received criticism in the social media on Saturday: many people wondered whether the tsunami warning had been withdrawn too early.
The Agency stated that it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to cancel the warning on the basis of data from the nearest flood sensor located about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We don’t have surveillance data from Palu.
That's why we had to make a decision based on the data we had," said Rahmat Triyon, Head of the BMKG earthquake and tsunami Centre.
The nearest flood meter, which measures changes in sea level, found only a “minor” wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not notice huge waves near Palu.
“If we had a flood meter at Palu or had received data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We need to think about this in the future," said Triyon.
According to the officials, the tsunami hit Palu and the surrounding areas at a high speed – hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is unclear whether it occurred before the warning was withdrawn or later.
Residents check dead bodies on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of the videos distributed in the social media, we believe that the tsunami took place before the official cancellation of the warning," Triyon said.
The most damaging 9.5-point earthquake occurred on the second Christmas day of 2004 and caused a huge tsunami that killed about 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The scenic city of Palu, with 380 000 people, is near the narrow mouth of the island of Sulaves in the northeast.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (NDA), the tsunamis destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Baptist Gombert, a geophysical researcher at Oxford University, the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
The earthquake on Friday was caused by a horizontal break – the adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally rather than vertically as usual for the tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a landslide in the sea that pushed a lot of water and caused a tsunami," he added, adding that the force of waves moving toward the shore could concentrate on a narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Agency for the Reduction of Accidents, told his correspondents that his team was "ready to send easy public warnings", when the tsunami warning was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, text messages were repeatedly sent to the residents with warnings, but Nugroho said that due to the earthquake area the electricity and communication lines were cut off and there were no sirens along the coast.
The Indonesians questioned in the social media whether the BMKG should have withdrawn the tsunami warning and were angry that the information was not provided in due time.
"I am disappointed... Warning cancelled... And the tsunami still happened..." - Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to the BMKG.
Golf: The duo “Mollywood” is going to beat ticket sales records
Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood won a four-way competition on Saturday, and will probably be recorded in history, because representing Europe is already leading the score at 10:6 against the Ryder Cup final.
After winning Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau's score 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four matches.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do this in 1979.
The shocking results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
A couple three times won 14 important titles of Woods and twice won against Patrick Reed.
They also won the victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, a US team this week who won the next three matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwoods will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five possible.
Fleetwood has already earned the most points in the Ryder Cup Unit Competition as a newcomer European.
At first glance, a couple of new fans named Mollywood did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward.
No such performance is expected from the newcomers of the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, and Molinaris did not hit any of the previous six matches and landed in four.
However, there was also hope: "Fleetwood" was the first in Europe last year, knows "Le Golf National" square as its five fingers and here in 2017 won the "French Open" tournament and demonstrated a determined temperament during this year's "U.S. Open".
Moliner is a new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent European tournament player, a useful feature in a steep square where high grass can cause death, as shown by American failures.
These features of players and harmonious game in the square made them invincible.
"I feel a little sensual now, and I'm only Saturday," said Fleetwood, who is known for his relaxation and has played all weekend with a wide smile in the face.
This afternoon we showed up perfectly, played in a stable and good way.
If we are united in history, this will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we've tried for the team."
Molinari also rejoiced.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to fulfil our duty and not just get into record books, so tomorrow we will have to struggle hard for 4.5 points we need to win; it won't be easy."
Knight fever!
Irish village turned into a medieval battlefield
The Claregalway Castle in the west of Ireland was previously the main fortress of the 15th - century English knight family, and its origin was remembered this Saturday.
Knights duel with swords during medieval battle festival at Claregalway Castle in Golveja, Ireland, September 29, 2018
The yard of a fully restored AngloNORMAN house with a tower has been turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world have restored to detail the contact fights and games that have been popular centuries ago.
Carlos Dornan, dressed in a knight, and Donna Dornan, patrolled their ferry suit in the great art of Claregalway Castle during the medieval battle festival in Golway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
"It's a great weekend trip and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald from Keri County, who became the owner of the tavern for the weekend.
“This is how we came back to the simplest.
I'm trying to do everything as I should," said the theatre worker, who for the first time participated in an armed battle festival.
While their swords were stupid, the helmets of some were folded, and one wounded his lips.
The riders demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbages and aubergines in half.
Near the metal founders forbid arms, spices merchants prepared medicine, and handicraftsmen made and painted wool.
Seriously disposed and well - dressed participants tried to get into their roles.
“I think anyone can wear a suit, but empathy is art,” said Helena Stockpool, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are handmade.
I've been sewing my belt for two years, and now I've been wearing a dress and I've only sew 800 pearls on her sleeves.
It matters to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths increased to 832
According to the National Agency for Disaster Reduction, the number of people killed on Sunday after the earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulaves, Indonesia, has risen to 832 and the area affected is higher than initially assumed.
The agency's representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference that many people were stuck after a 7.5-point earthquake that took place on Friday and led to a six-metre (20-foot) tsunami wave.
FBI addressed the second woman who accused candidate Kavanaugh
The FBI agents investigating the case of Bretto Kavanaugh, a candidate for the US Supreme Court, turned to the second woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was revealed by the woman's lawyer on Sunday.
The report by Deborah Ramirez lawyer John Clune states that the investigation conducted by the FBI in the Kavanaugh case will not only cover individual charges of rape brought this week by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, a Conservative judge of the Federal Court of Appeal, at the dramatic sitting of the Senate.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her his penis at a party where he was drunk, which took place at the Yale University dormitories when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave in to the moderate pressure of the Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI to conduct a study after a Thursday meeting of the Senate, where Professor Ford of the University of California made a detailed accusation that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party held in 1982 when they both attended school and were teenagers.
On Saturday NBC News reported that the White House limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
The brief denied this and published a Twitter message: "I really want them to interview all the people they need at their own discretion."
The representative of the White House, Ray Shah, said that the Senate had determined the scope and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they have been taught," said Shah.
United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards after Braxito
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not abandon environmental or animal protection standards so that trade transactions can be concluded after Braxito.
Michael Gove, British Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, arrives at Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said that it would be useful for the United Kingdom to be known for its quality food products and that the government would announce a strategy on food this year.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup in Unit Races
Francesco Molinaris earned the glory on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th hole and earned a point that helped to achieve the required result of 14.5.
Mickelson surrendered to the hole, putting the first ball into the water, and on the rolling ground, he managed to survive Molinaris became the first European to win all five matches a week, although none of the previous six were hit.
Europe's victory has already been ensured that italics kicked off the ground and there was a lack of one point for the continental victory, while Henrik Stanson and Sergio Garcia were at least half a point in the first match.
At the beginning of the day they took the lead in the result of 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from the possible 12 so that they could recover the trophy and establish their dominion at home, extending from 1993.
Prior to this, the team only two times managed to eliminate the difference between four points and win unit competitions: the US team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 in the “Medina Miracle”, but no one expected another amazing return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave the Jim Furyk team hope of winning the first match, but then the European team points spread throughout the square.
Thorbjorne Olesen crushed Jordan Spieth, and his teammate new John Rahm – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles won four of the four.
Ian Poulter, the best-known Ryder Cup player, was probably the most oval this week when the best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, landed on the 18th Ride and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then we had to wait for the match to end first, and it was Molinari's game, which caused a wave of joy in the crowd, which was the greatest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German policemen protecting the Erdogan used neonacio's name as a code name
According to the local media, secret officials in East Germany used the name of the sadly famous neo-Nazi extremist to protect Turkish President Erdogan during his visit to Berlin this week.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region stated that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany investigates two members of the SEC of the elite anti-terrorist group.
The men were assigned to protect the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
The officials had to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, the sadly famous neonaci, as part of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) extremist group, which killed eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen and a German police officer at the beginning of this century.
Local media report that a strange code name is known when two policemen requested permission to access internal documents necessary for the task.
The authorities immediately withdrew the police.
The leader of Saxony's criminal police, Petrica Kleine, first responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "likely to have been the stupidest" and that "the victims and their loved ones are obviously ignored".
Roland Woller, the Minister of the Interior of Saxony, agreed with this statement and called the decision "false, dreadful and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan's visit to Berlin on Friday led to many controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important "because in the event of disagreement, they have to be dealt with in person".
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardto and his associate Uwe Mundlos were found in the trailer house that burned in East Germany.
One of them is believed to have killed another and then committed suicide following an unsuccessful attempt to rob a bank in the city of Eizenach.
The third member of the Neonazi group, the last remaining Bate's Zschaepe, is soon arrested.
In July this year, the German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 charges of murder.
She denied her contribution to the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused felt moral guilt because she did not try to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies have received a lot of criticism.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of victims believe that the group had many more associates.
It also became clear that the German internal intelligence agency BfV infiltrated a large number of informants into the NSU and constantly prevented the investigation of group-related murders, attempts to kill and robberies.
Muskas withdraws from Tesla’s head position and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who brought him to court for fraud in Twitter messages, where he claimed to be a private company of Tesla.
Muscos will have to withdraw from the post of Head, but the Director General will remain.
The documents of the agreement state that Muscos must leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to that position for three years.
He'll also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Everything started with a Twitter message that was either negligent or deliberately misleading, so Muskas will have to receive prior confirmation before saying or publishing "Tesla" "in any format, including, but not limited to, social media (e.g. Twitter), company's website (e.g. company's blog), press releases and investor calls".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it has not checked Muskas' original Twitter message.
In the complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors in a Twitter message of 7 August, in which he said that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company, one of which would be worth $420 – so the company's securities increased by more than 10 percent.
Musk soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public, and angered investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musk's initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it did not rely on facts".
Musk himself explained in the blog that this mistake could be justified: after a meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Property Fund, he had the impression that he had managed to reach an agreement on the funds.
It is reported that Muscos and the Securities and Exchange Commission had come close to a milder penalty – Muscos would have had to give up the position of the Chairman for only two years and should not be held guilty, but Muscos refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday the price of Tesla's securities fell and probably he changed his opinion again and agreed to stricter conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as in the old one, Muscos does not have to confess the fault of misleading investors.
The patriarch of Alexandria committed himself to supporting the Canonical Church of Ukraine and urged orthodox unity
Theodore II of Alexandria declared himself based on a canonical Ukrainian orthodox church belonging to the patriarch of Moscow.
He spoke in response to the separation between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore arrived on Thursday II to the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and believers in orthodox.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, descending only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I came to tell you, do not give up orthodox faith and canonical churches," Patriarch Theodore II said in his address.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the Polish orthodox church metropolitanist Savva, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legalise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently suffered a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian orthodox church, also known as the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send his explorers to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering in another’s affairs.
Experiments are special representatives of the patriarch, formally holding a higher position than the metropolitan Onufriey, who is the current head of the Moscow Patriarchate Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The Moscow Patriarchate has responded to the actions of Constantinople and has withdrawn all common church services and membership in organizations led or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
It is claimed, however, that this decision warned Constantinople against other hostile actions and that both churches were not considered to have completely ceased ties.
Out of the three churches in Ukraine, other churches recognize only one – the Moscow Patriarchate Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
Most Ukrainian clergy acknowledge its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the secluded churches – the Ukrainian orthodox church owned by the Kiev Patriarchate, which dates back to the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Philaret, who seeks official recognition of the orthodox church, complete independence and equality with the Moscow patriarch.
Damascus opened for the first time in three years the main Syrian-UN trade transition
According to the state news agency SANA, the Syrian government said that it would open a border border with Jordan on Nasib, which was closed for three years due to hostilities in the territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side have abandoned the land near the city of Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
Key messages from Lavrov’s UN speech
While visiting the UN, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, attacked the West for "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not surrender to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday, the Minister said at the UN General Assembly that some Western countries are putting pressure on others in an attempt to maintain “the positions of world leaders that are attributed to themselves. ”
He did not name specific countries, but he said that they are using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world has to pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who represented Russia in the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that diplomatic and negotiating culture is being replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions imposed without the approval of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed by many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and recalled the US blockade for Cuba over many years.
"But history hasn't taught us anything," said Lavrov and added that "Western supporters tend to blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unfounded accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion in Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and recalled the seven-year war in Syria as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to demolish the Damascus regime could have been disastrous for the whole country and opened the way for a "terrorist califet".
Lavrov praised the Astana peace process jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran and stated that it had helped to prevent the Islamic State (IS, previously known as ISIS) and other groups who wanted to seize Syria as a whole.
Now, the most important thing is to rebuild the country’s ruined places and help refugees to return home safely.
Lavrov returned to the struggle of the great forces and said that the UN was actually founded "after learning from the Second World War".
The Russian Foreign Minister recalled that in 2018 he is 80 years old from the “grumble” Munich Treaty signed in 1938, whereby France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German-populated Czechoslovakia to calm Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", a year later war began.
"Munchen betrayal" shows how far "egoism of countries and disregard for international law" can lead," said Lavrov.
"The dictatorship and coercion of the colonial era must be placed in a historical archive or a bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, said Lavrov.
"If you have questions or accusations, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleague's arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Crislas in the eyes of a stranger?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by fog and Bibi blinks its finger into Iran
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, the Israeli Prime Minister said that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that the blamed Israelis are hiding something themselves.
The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who loved the presentation, revealed the news on Thursday – he showed high photographed photographs of the places where Iran allegedly holds nuclear material.
Tehran replied quickly that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its "undeclared nuclear weapon program".
Although Israel never recognized (but never denied) nuclear weapons, the RT journalist Murado Gazdeev tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually look for a log in his eye.
Scottish Government: no complaints have been made against Alex Salmondo before January
The Scottish Government stated that no complaints had been recorded prior to January of this year concerning Alex Salmondo.
Two accusations of sexual harassment against the former First Minister in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the study in March.
Salmondo, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, is a case-law with the Scottish Government regarding a complaint against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been recorded by January.
A Scottish government official said: “In January, the Scottish government received two complaints against Alex Salmondo.
We could have ignored them or concealed them.
In the past, the former First Deputy Minister did not receive any complaints against Alex Salmondo and, as we have already said, the first Minister heard about the investigation from Alex Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and we will persist in defending our position.
The Scottish government will try to get as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot comment more on Mr Salmondo's case for legal reasons."
Alex Salmondo’s representative said: “We will not comment, because our petition against the permanent secretary is now pending at the hearing and we hope that a decision will be taken shortly.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasg crushed Dragons' score 29:13: "Warriors" player Lee Jones's neck
Glasgas regained the winner title in Guinness Pro14 league by earning extra points and winning Dragons at Scottstown stadium, while coach Dave Rennie does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game could have been more accurate.
After the unexpected defeat of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked a lot of changed teams to try and even though she was able to collect the necessary points to survive at the top of the A conference, the matches played in the cool and rainy weather were certainly not smooth.
"I think we were doing a great job tonight, playing on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
“We have to play more precisely and we have been able to seize more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are pleased with this.
We need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won additional points, but next week we have to do more at home with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the weather was windy, the Glasgow team began to earn points early, but TMO caught all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including his capture of Niko Matawalu's internal transfer to the left corner.
Disillusioned for a long time: the left pillar Ollis Kebble broke out in the middle for the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the throw.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received a fine, and the security hit another player immediately after 20 minutes and the Welshs scored a point.
After a rather quiet first half of the game, it ran almost half an hour's mark: Glasgow attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry punished the Welshs for 22 minutes on the side of Hastings.
Warriors landed in the fight, but lost the ball after a smooth handover, because the left side of Matawalu was unable to control it and it was passed on to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and shrewdly handed the ball away to Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings' position and the result in the middle of the match became 12:6.
The first minute of the second half of Glasgow was very successful: the Alex Dunbar ball was caught by Lee Jones and assisted by Hastings.
However, after failure Warriors did not give up – only four minutes later they took over the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons center Adam Warren took it under the gate, thus earning points, and later Joseph Lewis took over the open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and, 54 minutes after the fourth test, earned additional points when Huwa Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure of the four tests).
Glasg maintained a comfortable higher position and carried out the fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar passed the ball after a fight with George Horne and Hastings scored points.
Kebble was declared the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously hindered us from playing, but we were at the middle," said the coach.
“He missed a few meters, but he was slippery and still managed to get away.
He's in good shape and trusts himself."
Ayr United won Morton's score 1:5: Five-star Ayr crushed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore earned two goals, and Declan McDaido added another one, thus helping Ayr to stay at the top of the championship table.
"Ayr" broke forward after the Shankland Gate, beat out of six yards after Michael Rose's angular impact on McDaid.
Morton's 35th minute was equalized by his first attempt, when Charlie Telfer took the ball away from the dubious Robbie Crawford's own court and sent him through the Gatekeeper Ross Doohan to a faraway country with a low spring.
Players from Grinoco had a chance to get out of the way for the fourth second minute when Doohan destroyed Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak penalty that was easily caught by the goalkeeper.
Ayr's 74th minute overcame the rivals for the second time, when the transfer of the alternate Craig McGuffie's long distance was hit in the air and fell on the ground was sent to the gate by another alternate Craig Moore.
Moore passed the ball to Shankland for the same minute, which hit 17 goals this season.
As the fans shouted, Moore returned to his side the fourth from the edge of the court, and McDaidas sent the back ball to the gate.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" match ended in 0:2: first youth victory in the league
"I am glad, I feel relief, I am happy," – I was delighted by Ray McKinnons after the very necessary first Falkirk victory in the league and earned season points.
Rangers borrowed Zakas Ruddens (18 years) earned a stake in both huts and pushed the host team Alloa Athletic to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from the distressing problems.
"This was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
“We probably deserve more in the last three events, so it was great to score three points in a tense situation.
I am pleased that we have received the first points.
It wouldn't have caused anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough for the 26th minute and earned a goal from the gate line in the middle of the second lift, when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over the gatekeeper Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but failed," said Jim Goodwinas, Head of Wasps.
“Hearts” fans petition for the semifinal received more than 11 000 signatures
More than 11 000 people signed a petition from the fans of Hearts regarding the Betfred Cup's semi-finals schedule.
They are angry with the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and in the same stadium.
Following advice from the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to hold the Aberdeen-Rangers play at 12:00, while Hearts-Celtic – 19:45, thus provoked the anger of the fans of Jamba and Dons.
The Evening News together with Aberdeen Evening Express asked for a fair solution for fans on Saturday.
The decision of the so-called Super Saturday was condemned both by Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs published statements criticising the timetable.
On Thursday, a petition was published on the change.org requiring one of the matches to be moved to another place or date.
A man accused of stabbing two women in the village of Kent
Two women in the sixties and eighties died in the place of the crime.
According to the police, another man, who has also reached the age of 70, has been hospitalized and is in stable condition.

Royal Archives and the creators of the musical "Hamilton" light the world about King Jurgis III
When the Queen presented her project, which opened a huge archive of documents gathered during the third year of George’s reign, she expected that letters, blogs and languages would help society to get to know the king who was considered crazy.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with the Vestendo musician.
Academics who want to reveal the real face of the king invited Jurgis III actor to review the most important documents from the times of queen's proproprosenel's rule.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a large crowd of performance fans will be able to access digital documents.
The members of the royal family have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the Duke and Duke of Sasex will watch the performance twice, although the ancestor of Prince Harry is constantly shown on stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays a king in Vestende, said that the documents made us think and helped us to get to know the king whose image was formed by the musical "Hamilton", the film "King George's Madness" and the series for children "Hamilton".
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
US President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after trying to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Une and said at the meeting of his supporters on Saturday that they had "been in love" after the correspondence.
Mr. Trumpas and Mr. Kim said they would seek nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula, which they discussed at the unprecedented meeting held this year in Singapore.
Prior to entering a new phase of history after many years of public disagreement, the leaders of the countries exchanged threats and insults because North Korea wanted to build a nuclear missile capable of reaching the US.
“I was tough like him.
We kept wording," said Mr. Trumpas at the meeting in Western Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, excellent letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos have reached the semi-finals of the Greek Cup
The Athens Panathinaikos Greek Cup held a victory in the quarter-finals without much effort by Lukas Lekavičius.
The Athenian team took the result 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) out of the Patras' Prometheus crew.
He spent 14 minutes on the square, earned 4 trails (2/2 div.), regained one ball and performed one performance transfer and twice passed.
Nick Calathes, who scored 15 points, competed most in "Panathinaikos" ranks.
Crossing the square for Shimonyte: everything decided by the party's cream
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that in the internal elections of Conservatives there was a lack of democracy, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrida Šimonytė as a presidential candidate.
"The "democracy" celebration itself was strange, however, to put it mildly, when the party's cream, the summit decided and actively supported one candidate.
There was probably no chance for the second candidate to win even theoretically," S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the Government
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, and we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister of the State Greens said that I. Šimonytė should be appreciated by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
Mr Skvernelis is not commenting on whether he himself will participate in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of the ruling "states", described the Conservative elections as a "failed experiment" due to the low participation of the parties.
"First of all, one must welcome the experiment, which absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members participated, with only about 20 thousand voters in total.
Knowing what money should have been spent on organising those elections, it is clear accordingly that this failed", R. Karbauskas said to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think that the cost will not justify the result, because the result is no one, the party decided that their candidate is all right, but who spends so much money," he added.
During the internal elections on the weekend, 79% of the Conservative Party members and their supporters voted in favour of Mr Šimonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries joke Estonians: one area can change everything
According to a Baltic survey conducted by Baltic Salary Survey, the company organising the remuneration studies, the wages of the Baltic States grew mostly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia lag a little behind their neighbour, according to the company's press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we can see that monthly wage before tax in Lithuania grew by 81.8 per cent of employees and on average increased by 7.7 per cent, and annual wage with supplements - by 10.5 per cent.
Latvia has slightly overstepped us - there has been a little more annual salary, but like Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povilas Blusius, a representative of the company organising the remuneration research and adds that with such wage growth trends, the general economic indicators of the country that dictate them should also be taken into account.
The fastest wage growth in Estonia
Although Latvia and Estonia had a lower share of employees than Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages grew by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached slightly more than in our country - 11%.
In Estonia, this year's pay rose by 73% of workers and on average it increased by 13 percent.
The trend in wage growth is also strongly influenced by the turnover of workers, since those who change jobs can receive much higher wages than in the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed their jobs and jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - more often than in the other Baltic countries the bonuses have been paid.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual increase in remuneration for such employees was only 3,6 percent.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States, not only as the average largest raise in wages for new workers, but also for long-term employees.
For those who did not change jobs or positions, the salary was the fastest one here: a month of 6%, and an annual year of 9%, including the annexes.
According to the remuneration research specialist, such trends often depend on whether or not they go hand in hand with the country's general economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market moods.
For example, forecasts of the upcoming economic downturn encourage business to be more cautious and less investment-friendly.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction and pharmaceuticals, may also rise to general statistics and overshadow minor changes.
Latvians bear the greatest tax burden
When comparing wage growth, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the largest share of taxes depending on their pay - 31% or 34%, which can increase to 42,4 percent for more earners.
For example, Lithuania has a constant 24 per cent rate, so with higher wage growth in Latvia, employees may have the same or even lower perceived growth than in Lithuania.
Estonia has a similar tax rate as Lithuania - 23,6 per cent, so we find the most favourable taxing of labour in the Baltic States in this country.
IT field - the most competitive salaries
According to the study, in all the Baltic States almost regardless of the level of duties, IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail is the market for positions in this area with one of the smallest indices, so employees earn income below the market average.
Compared to the previous year, wages were fastest to increase for engineering specialists with higher positions, as well as for risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration has not exceeded some positions in the IT field this year – a significant part of the organisation's information security specialists' monthly salaries have been increased to 14 percent.
At the same time, wages remained almost unchanged in retail trade.
However, some companies have successfully implemented the restructuring of their remuneration systems, which has resulted in an annual wage increase of around 2 percent.
According to remuneration specialists, there is a tendency that wage growth dictates the demand of the most demanding specialists – the demand of system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.

White or brown: what kind of sugar is recommended by a dietician
White or brown?
Which sugar to choose?
During the survey in shopping centres it became clear that although Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many Lithuanians are refusing this ingredient, which is called white death.
The fact that brown sugar sales are also growing is also true of supermarkets.
According to the representative of McMaxima, brown sugar is becoming increasingly popular and is being bought more and more by compatriots, although ordinary white sugar is still the preferred option.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialised organic shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to Dietologist Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful health effects can be both.
"Red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, it is harmful to the body when it is multiplied," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
To live without sugar, the dietist recommends a gradual reduction in daily diets.
If you do this - the benefits in every way - the unwanted kilograms will fall and the health will improve.
The month’s consistent use of sugar less will make it easier to give up and completely.
"We form every habit in about a month's time, so if we do such an experiment, let's say, a month's time when we drink some sugar-free product - coffee or tea - we'll see how positively it works and I think that everyone can give up a little bit of effort," the ideologist advises us how to give up sugar.
Doctors claim that sugar is not called white death needlessly - the abuse of sweets can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to reduce its consumption, especially since this product is added to many foods, even bread.
Another step of "Lietkabelis": Lipkevičius lends to another LKL crew
Panevezys "Lietkabelis" team said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevicius - the attacker is lent to Prienai "Skycop" crews.
In this "Betsafe-LKL" season V.Lipkevičius dropped 6.4 points in 22 minutes, returned 2.8 balls, performed 2 productive transfers and collected 8.5 utility points.
In the FIBA Champions League 29 years of 198 cm tall athletes statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 points recovered ball, 1.5 points of performance and 4.8 points of utility in 21 minutes.
In the near future, "Lietkabelis" will announce a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevic joined the coach staff
The chief coach of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" Nenadas Chanakas has become a well-known helper to Lithuanians Sandis Buškevicas.
The 41-year-old Latvian played in Vilnius "Lietuvos Rytas" in the 2005-2006 season, and in 2014-2017 worked in this club system as a assistant to the coach.
Last season S.Buškevicas trained the Jekabpils team.
The sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babrauskas to the staff, but he is still planning to continue his basketball career.
Vytenis Jasikevicius had also received the invitation, but the two sides failed to reach an agreement.
S.Buškevica will work together with Robertas Kuncaitis and Algimantas Bružs at the Lietkabelis Coach Headquarters.
On Tuesday Latvians will join "Lietkabelis" and will be on the "Cido" Arena during the FIBA Champions League match with the Džion JDA, but we will not find it on the bench yet, because registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel price reduction will please not everyone
In order to reduce the prices of biofuels, more deciduous trees will be crossed in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, it is a wish to "affect" the prices of biofuels.
"We have large stocks of certain types.
We need to balance (...).
The concentration on soft foxes is because we can also have some impact on biofuel prices," K. Navickas said in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation regarding deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20 per cent.
According to the Minister, next year the pine will be cut as much as this year, and the spruce will be less than 80 hectares.
According to him, wood felling in Lithuania is more important due to favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be the next year," said Navickas.
Now, 10.2 million ha of forests are public and 800 thousand ha are private.
The fight against food prices is a dubious obligation: encourage purchase only in your area
Among the measures proposed by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, the proposed obligation for state institutions and organizations to purchase 50% of food from local producers is published in the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, local companies that won tenders could supply printing services or office goods to the buyer in municipalities", said Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius.
Egidijus Mockevičius, President of the Association of Processors of Meat Processors, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs and that it would be difficult to control whether the laws are not being used by resellers.
The head of the Business Confederation Valdas Sutkus also criticises the measure of inconsistency.
Macron calls on Europe to defend itself against Russia and the US
On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a 'real European army' capable of protecting against Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a joint European force since his arrival in power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
Recently, he has gained a solid argument after US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Power.
'We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,' Mr Macron said to the radio Europe 1.
This is the first interview given to his radio since the beginning of his post in May 2017.
"When I see President Trump announces that he withdraws from an important disarmament treaty created after the rocket crisis in Europe in the 1980s, what will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
This missile crisis was caused by the unstrategic nuclear weapons development race at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the US and the Soviet Union to conclude the medium-range nuclear agreement (INF) in 1987.
'We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army,' said Mr Macron during an interview on Monday evening in Verden, north-east France, with the President visiting the battlefields of the First World War this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in a situation where Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated a potential threat... we need a Europe that defends itself better, not just dependent on the United States.
The French leader has become the main initiator of the project to set up forces in nine European countries capable of organising a rapid joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The Ministers of Defence of these nine countries will meet for the first time in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the details of how these forces will function.
The European Union is also committed to a significant increase in its defence budget from 2021 onwards, with around €13 billion in research and development over seven years.
The current EU defence budget is below EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomar of the French Military School, who is preparing high-ranking officers, said that the vision of the closely united European defence by Mr Macron is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between European defence, which Emmanuel Macron dreams of, and reality, which is a very great disagreement between European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we are not idiots
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko stated that his country would need a new armament if NATO continued to pool its forces at the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be frightened by the deployment of bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, in particular missiles," says the State News Agency Belta, which met a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
"Recently - you have noticed and we are not hiding - we have created our own missile industry and produced our very precise (reconcilable) missile weapons," the President underlined.
Lukashenka stated last week that Minsk and Moscow were looking for a suitable and inexpensive response to the plans to build a Polish base and to name it the name of the US President, Donaldo Trampo, for Fort Trump.
"Of course, we're worried about this.
If they say, let us say, in Poland, that they are prepared to spend millions of dollars there to deploy a brief fort (...), of course, we are not idiots and, of course, we are responding to it", said Mr Lukešenka when he took part in the discussions of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"Supranted, with our main ally (Russia) we are considering how to answer all this and how to find an appropriate response at the minimum cost", he added.
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 led to the collapse of Western relations with Moscow.
Their contacts are also being dragged by Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and, in March of this year, in Great Britain, it is believed that an attempt has been made by Russia's special services to poison the former double agent Sergey Scraple nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington became even worse in October when Mr Trump declared that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that that step could undermine the global security system.
A man who carried out a violent execution revealed how he killed his wife who raped a footballer
Brazil was subjected to a violent execution by Daniel Correa Freitas, a national footballer.
A sportsman was killed during the 18-year-old girl's birthday.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Parana, in the south-east of Brazil.
He is reported to have been executed by an execution of genitals cut off, and severe neck injuries are reported.
Edison Brittes Junior, who killed a footballer, admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C. Freitas raped his wife, Cristian Brittes.
The Brazilian murderer later described in detail what happened on the television air at the fatal night.
"The evening had already gained momentum when I realized that I had never seen my wife, Cristiana, for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I broke the door before waiting, and saw Danielle lying naked in bed and my wife, who asked for help.
I was deadly mad.
Together with my friends at the party, we took him out into the car.
Here I had a knife with which I fed my wife a man who had been raped.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything for myself at that moment," said the murderer.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of a footballer next to the river, where police officers are also looking for the main tool of rude crime.
The civil Brazilian police arrested E.B. Juniora, his wife and his daughter who celebrated birthday.
It is said that police officers investigating the event still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
It is true that recently distributed latest footballer messages and photos on the occasion of WahtsApp can help the course of the investigation.
A footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through WhatsApp, where he remembered himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as turned out later, is murderer's wife Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various rooms of the house.
I'm going to eat her mother, even though her father's around," the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the Sao Paulo Club, was lent in the second highest capacity in the Brazilian league for Sao Bento.

He was so proud of her.
The fans of Austin Pauers lost their heads: another part of the film awaits
The cult comedy "Ostin Pauers" admired millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, laughing shots and costumes are still becoming inspiration for many fans.
The film's creator and main star Mike Myers announced that the fourth "Ostin Pauers" film is waiting.
However, one of the main actors who embodied in the "Mini Me" film can no longer be seen.

Juliette Lewis will join the series Koners, created according to Rozana
The Stars of Million Particles and Parking series on the Juliette Lewis network Twitter confirmed that they joined the Koners series created by Rozana.
"Yes, that's true.
The secret is revealed! #JulietteLewissontheconners #TheConners" – this week, an actress wrote in Twitter's message and published a photo in which she kept a script with the name of the situation comedy.

“Tell me who will join #TheConners ??!”
I met my brother from the Grizwald family again!
That's great.
The scenario TOKS GERAS. #JulietteLewissonTheConners", wrote Lewis.
Lewis and Galeckis played a brother and sister Audrey and Rusty Griswoldus in the 1989 film Christmas Holiday.
According to "Hollywood Reporter", Lewis will play Galecki's girl Blue, but it's not clear how many series they're going to show up.
The "Konersu" debut is scheduled for October.
This spring, the ratings of the returned series were high and updated for another season, but its creator and star Roseanne Barr were also released in May because Twitter shared a racist joke about the former Obama Administration Officer.
Most of the initial Rozana team, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman, will play in Koners.
"Showtime" canceled the series "I'm dying here" two seasons later.
“Jimo Carrey produced "Showtime" drama-commodity "I am dying here" was revoked after two seasons.
"Showtime" refused to order the third season of Jim Carrey's drama-commodity "I am dying here".
Deadline.com states that the cable television network has withdrawn the series due to low viewing.
The action of the series by Melissa Leo, Aria Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy and Andrew Santino took place on the stage of live comedy performances in the 1980s.
"I am very grateful for the last three years. When I'm asked about the series, I say, "It's a complex series about the complex people... but it was fun to create it." Thank you for looking at it," wrote the Angela on Friday on Twitter.

Eva Green and Marton Csokas will play in BBC drama "Lights"
Eva Green, a star of cheap horror stories, Marton Csokas and Eve Hewson, a performer of Robin Hude, will play the BBC in the six-part drama Lights.
The book-based series of the Eleanor Catton Man Booker Prize begins to be filmed in November.

I loved her novel very much, and the adaptation reveals even more exceptional things for television," Green said in the statement.
"It was a great pleasure to adapt the novel to television and I am delighted to be able to work with wonderful artists from different fields," added Catton.
“Romanas is written in loneliness, and writing a script is undoubtedly a teamwork and I am very happy that the light world has expanded and become richer than I could not imagine.
It's great that the wonderful Claire McCarthy will lead everything, and I look forward to seeing how this great team will play this story."
Alabama Hurts can no longer use suspension
Alabama's backup player, Jalen Hurts, will not be able to be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the top ranking Crimson Tide Saturday match against Louisiana's weaker team, which is the fifth player's match this season.
This year, the NCAA applied a new rule: it is possible to suspend the player who took part in four matches.
This month, Athletic announced that Hurts planned to do this because of the controversial role played by the assessment and the team's staff's response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said that he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama enter the game for the national champion title against the Georgian team, but the second half was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to Crimson Tide's victory score 26:23.
Hurts, a former South-East Conference attacker, started his last 28 Alabama matches and entered the season with record results – 26:2.
During the Saturday competition Hurts completed the first four episodes of Crimson Tide 22 out of 31 transfers, ran 276 yards, scored four times points and once took over the ball.
He also ran 15 times with a ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Deza must sign the contract immediately
Des Bryant, the former attacker of the Dallas Cowboys, said that he was about to return to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Glory Museum, said that it would be better for Bryanto not to delay.
Answering a question asked by Twitter when he was going to sign a contract with a team, Bryant announced on Friday a single word for Twitter: "Soon."
Three times selected for Pro Bowl matches Bryant is not a member of any team since he was abandoned in the middle of April by Dallas Cowboys in the event of a wage dispute.
Bryantas, who may have refused a contract with Baltimore "Ravens" and is constantly connected with Cleveland "Browns", said just before the season he wanted to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, Owens, who is still talking about returning to NFL, said that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
"He has to join the team and prove to everyone what he can," said Owens to the site.
“All surveyors believe that he is no longer successful and that he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he has to get into the team for any salary, accept a one-year or two-year contract – it's totally irrelevant – and show everyone what he can do."
Bryant Dallas team in 2017 69 times caught the ball, ran 838 yards and scored six times.
In 29 years the player did not run 100 yards in his career – 23 competitions.
After signing a five-year contract worth $70 million in 2015, Bryant did not run 1000 yards in any season and did not get more than eight points.
"If the Director-General or the owner thinks your skills are getting worse, you will not be able to guarantee or accumulate the amount you want," said Owens.
He also warned Bryant that he had to get into the team as soon as possible, because later it could fail at all and said that he could return to the "Cowboys" who survived difficult times.
"Of course. I don't know if their relationship has been damaged," said Owens, who 38 times earned points during three seasons playing in the Dallas team.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys takes him back and he gets a chance, it's good for Dezo and franchise."
Discussion on establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
The representatives of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) who visited Kaunas last week evaluate the possibilities to establish a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten such business incubators in Europe where companies receive aid for commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to societal needs.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of this organization's business incubator in the country was already suspended at that time.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering in Santako Valley.
During the meeting guests together with representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and Business discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"This incubator would encourage the application of knowledge and technologies accumulated by CERN to solve important problems, for example, new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing of big data," says Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, KTU's scientific and innovation director.
CERN incubators, like other new business development centres, provide support for business development by providing information and expert advice on application of technologies in product development and by helping to find sources of financing.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such a centre would involve experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
CERN is best known for Switzerland's large Hadron counter-flow accelerator (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
However, CERN does not only perform quantum mechanics, but also researches in other fields, from cryogenics (very cold temperatures affecting substances) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and scientific work have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
Vilnius Vodka has a new manager
The producer of beverages AB "Vilniaus degtinė" appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new CEO, who will replace Raimondas Pilke in this position.
Since last year, Mr. Pilkė, who led the company last year, will continue to be the Finance Director of Vilnius Vodka, according to a report distributed via the Vilnius Stock Exchange of Nasdaq.
Mr. Mituzas is the co-founder of the company "Buga LT" producing sauces, indicated in his "Linkedin" account.
2012-2017 Mr. Mituz was a regional director in SPI Group and previously worked in Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
Vilnius Vodka completed in the first quarter of this year with a loss of EUR 315.500.
Last year the company earned 392.300 EUR profit during the relevant period.
The company's sales revenue without excise duty amounted to EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people are employed in Vilnius Vodka.
STT detained R. Ača - Business news
Former parliamentarian and former director of Raseiniai district municipality administration Remigijus Ačas suspected bribery.
He's in custody.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) announces that officials of the Board of Šiauliai are conducting pre-trial investigation into possible corruption that has occurred in Raseiniai district municipality.
"The former director of Raseiniai district municipality administration R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - red. pašt.) suspected bribery.
The circumstances shall be investigated regarding the non-transparent public procurement, R.A. in the position of the director of the municipality - possible exceptional preference for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with an enterprise managed by the Raseiniai district municipality.
It is suspected that Mr A adopted a big bribe (over 250 MGL) for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is the Raseiniai bus park.
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the alleged leader of the company "Raseinių bus park" managed by the Raseiniai municipality.
This BNS was approved by STT press representative Renata Endružytė.
The STT report states that the allegations are also made by two representatives of companies who directly bribed Mr. Acha or participated in the masking of bribes in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, searched at their workplaces and at home.
Suspension of membership of LSDD
Remigijus Ačas was the director of Raseiniai district municipal administration for a while, but in April, if the council did not approve of his report, he lost these duties.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012.Mr.Ačas was a long-term member of the Seimas and was elected to the parliament from 2004 as a candidate for the party "Tvarka and Justice".
In 2013, however, he and this party separated their roads, and in the 2016 Seimas elections he was not able to win his mandate independently.
Now Mr. Ačas is dependent on the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Shortly after the presentation of this news, the President of the LSDD Kirkilas informed the press that Mr. Ačas temporarily suspended membership of the party until the investigation took place.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the allegations made to Remigius Ačius are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to take all necessary steps to find out the truth.
R. Ačas temporarily suspended membership of the party until pre-trial investigation takes place," says Kirkilas, the leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, Mr. Ačas was the head of a team of advisors to the then President Roland Paks, who was subsequently removed from office through impeachment.
Mayor Gricius: I did not directly control Mr Acho's work
Neither the mayor of Raseiniai district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS said on Monday that they had no information about what particular purchase could be related to the law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gricius said that he was apprehending Mr. Ach when he learned from the media.
'I can't really say we've been very separated by functions, I've been working as a mayor, he (R.Ača - BNS) - by the administration, and I can't tell you what the reasons for this case were, or why the case was done,' the mayor said on Monday.
He also claimed that he did not wish to assess for the same reasons the former management of the municipality administration of Mr. Ačas.
I would be afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as far as he was presented to me for public procurement, for tenders, he said that such and such public procurements had taken place, such competitions, and then what was visible in public space, contracts were concluded, as I saw as mayor.
So I can't tell you how he led the administration at that time as its director," said Mr Gricius.
He said that he himself did not intervene in public procurement and did not influence them.
Minister of Culture in the team - new adviser
The team of advisors of Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson, Minister of Culture, was supplemented by Doc. Dr. Joseph Blažinas.
He will advise on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that from 2016 he was the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive and the professor of the Department of Musicology of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 the students of the Faculty of Communication of the Vilnius University elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and preservation of values.
The Calamity Continues
The VŽ recalls that in May this year the team of Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson was left by counsellor Dr Viktor Bachmetyev, who advised the Minister on information policy issues, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr. Rookytė-Jonsson said that her new Deputy Minister of her choice would create the same areas as Mr. Augustinavičius.
At the moment, in addition to the area that is curated by Augustinavičius, the team of the minister's advisers consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and the chief adviser Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: Business at Risk 90 M€ due to a lack of functioning GPS
Simonas Gentvilas, Vice-President of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, says that due to the poorly functioning Product, Packaging and Waste Accounting Information System (GPAIS), Lithuanian producers and importers may pay almost EUR 90 million in fines at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year approaches and the GPS system fails to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming an increasingly realistic scenario.
It is informally stated that only 1% of planned recycling tasks have been issued with certificates confirming the management of packaging waste," Mr. Gentvilas states in the press.
On 7 November, the Seimas shall initiate an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not functioning, for which reasons the module of the programme is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
"Without necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, manufacturers and importers risk getting huge environmental taxes again at the end of this year," says Mr. Gentvilas.
In his view, the weaknesses and inaction of the accounting system for GPS signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metroil crisis.
Concern about tasks
Some experts also warn that some companies may not be able to meet the national targets for recycling packaging waste for 2018.
Having seen the indicators of packaging recycling made public by organisations during the first half of the year, specialists confirm that they see grounds for concern that some organisations may not manage the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies might no longer be able to benefit from the emission tax relief and would be able to pay the emission tax for a certain amount of their packaging placed on the market each year.
The GOK wrote that two out of the three existing producer organisations reject such concerns, while one does not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, Director General of the Green Point of the biggest organisation, said that at least formally, the success of the task depends on solving the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Information Accounting System (GPAI).
The Green Point plans that this year it will be possible to overcome all types of packaging management tasks, except glass ones.
Although it will not be possible to overcome the task of glass for the Green Point this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses resulting from this.
Experts question the benefits of food vouchers
Experts question the benefits of this innovation when the government plans to provide food vouchers to less prosperous people, thus encouraging family or farmers' trade business.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are old and will not solve problems, and the Government should focus on increasing people's income.
"The system looks rather strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help society to buy something or have greater purchasing power, we need to direct all the capacity to increase people's incomes, and people themselves need to decide whether to buy in one store or another", said Mr Dubnikov.
According to him, the government's offer of food vouchers would be for people with lower incomes.
"Obviously, it applies to people who receive lower incomes, as if a voucher was placed on a pallet, on which it was written, uh, we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be favorable to us.
It sounds like certain pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them," said the analyst.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investments and will increase the administrative burden, because it will need to be supervised by who and how they are allowed, and by what protection against counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, Chief Economist of Swedbank, says that with one instrument, both objectives - to support low-income citizens and small entrepreneurs - would not be achieved.
"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, vouchers compensate for price differences and citizens can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the price difference is compensated by the state from the budget.
Then it's business support, but not population support," said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small shops and, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new entrants to enter the market.
"It would seem that it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and the residents would also be quite uncomfortable, they would have to shop at some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but look for several specialized shops with a smaller range," said the economist.
According to him, in other countries coupons are used when there is a limited amount of goods or services and they need to be provided to everyone in the same way, or to some social group.
The residents then receive the coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market, giving temporary tax relief to businesses, employing the long-term unemployed, or former prisoners, for example.
This practice was successfully applied in Lithuania, according to Mr. Mačiulis.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis stated on Monday that the new food coupon system under consideration by the government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage small traders or farmers.
Prime Minister's adviser Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30 percent discount.
According to him, the number of vouchers would be limited so that farmers would not be able to abuse it.
According to him, 3-5 vouchers would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget does not yet provide for funds for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps from European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently foreseen or not in the budget will be final, yet it will change in the Seimas, so happens, may be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries may change financing things.
There is always a priority, what a decision would be - whether to give up something, finding another additional source of income and so on," said Mr. Malinauskas on Tuesday.
It is up to the moment to decide on the extent to which innovation can be applied and from when.
