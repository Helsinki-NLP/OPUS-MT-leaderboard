Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that "it looks like dolls"
Some members of the Assembly were surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (in Lithuanian Member of the Wales Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at political level.
One member of the "Working" Assembly said that his group was concerned, "so it's rhymes with "Twp" and "Pwp".
It's not for the readers of Wales: "twp" means "silver" and "pwp" means "kaka".
The member of the "Plaid" Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfactory" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative claimed that his political group was "open" as a result of the change of name, but noted that it was a reduction of the word from MWP to a doll.
For the Walen letter w is said to be similar to the Yorkshire English word u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislative proposals to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which received strong support to call the Assembly the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to Members of the Wales Parliament or to WMP, but received the highest support during the public consultation.
The Assembly clearly offers alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present legislative proposals for amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of the Assembly member and the framework plan of the Committee.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on country name change
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held in order to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims on Greek territory and repeatedly objected to Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov, who objected to plebiscit for the change of name, said that he would not take the vote.
However, the referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem’s difficulties, the bells of St. Martyn and other churches were silenced
“The older people I spoke to said that historically, on each corner it was possible to find a bar and church,” said Adams.
- You're not going to find anyone else today."
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
“ Today people communicate differently, ” he said.
- Bars are no longer a neighboring site, where people regularly gather."
When he talks about churches, he is worried that money from the sale of property will not be sufficient for a long time, as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-apartment apartments with co-operative apartments where there will be people who will not help with the temples that have survived.
"Most people who buy co-operative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore end the moment when churches will close down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these co-operative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by the White Communities, before Harlem became a black metropolis – by the metropolitan community, while St. Martynas' church was built a decade later.
The original white methodist community was established in the 1930s.
Nearby the service, the black congregation took over the name of the building.
St. Martyn's church was taken over by the church of the Blacks by the clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shop in Harlem, which refused to recruit or appoint blacks.
In 1939, the building was greatly destroyed by fire, but because the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a wary.
The clergyman David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martyn church, proudly called the warrion the bells of the poor.
The experts, who played a carrill in July, called it differently – "cultural treasure" and "immutable historical instrument".
Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that this was the world’s first carillion played by a black musician, Dionio A. Lind. 18 years ago he started playing a larger carill in Riverside church.
Merriweather said that St. Martyn's church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the past few months in St. Martynas' church was a difficult story for architects and contractors – some of them were invited by the church's seculars and others – by the episcopal church diocese.
In July, Zacristy, the parish governing body composed of secular leaders, expressed concern to the bishop that the diocese "will try to take over the expenses" for the Zacristium, although it did not employ architects and contractors who were sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark in California wounded the catch of lobster in 13 years
The officers reported that the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday when he caught lobster in California on the day of opening of the lobster season.
He was attacked 7 o'clock in Ensinitas near the beach of Lighthouse.
Chad Hammel San Diego KSWB-TV shows said he dived with friends about half an hour after he heard a boy call for help, and then came with a group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel told me first that the boy was worried when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried: “I was bitten!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his whole keybone had been ripped.
“I started to cry out to everyone to get out of the water: “A shark is flying in the water!” Hammel added.
The boy was taken on a plane to the “Rady” Children’s Hospital of San Diego, where he was found to be in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was observed in that area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
He added that the victim had been injured by injuries at the upper torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty departments of all-purpose stores, where specialists will work.
With the UK's GBP 2.8 billion market for beauty, which continues to grow, and the fashion and household sales figures are falling, the larger beauty departments will be tested by 11 shops across the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves, sometime for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its range of beauty up to 3 000 product names, including such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more space in brand areas similar to those in such stores as "Boots".
The shopping centre also publishes its own Boutique range of make-up, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croidon, South London, and the second will be opened later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities every day from local supermarkets, more needs to be done to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that shop sales increasingly look like a department store, because the supermarket networks are trying to fight the sales of goods cheaper by offering more services and non-food goods at Aldi and Lidl stores.
Sainsbury's included Arga sales in hundreds of stores and also installed a number of Habitat stores, because two years ago it bought both networks, which are claimed to have strengthened sales of food products and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous attempt of the shopping center to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical department ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 1st century, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended with a dispute on how to distribute revenues from stores of pharmacists located in supermarkets.
The new strategy came about after Sainsbury's sold its drug business in 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's network, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
It was argued that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was accompanied by an extended range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the external and atmosphere of beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and because of attractive environment and comfortable places we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "sent" because Holly Willoughby has cut off his 11 million pounds deal with him
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones "sewed" after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby stopped his 11 million pounds deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their home trade mark Truly.
The pair's business was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old Head of the "This Morning" program announced that he was leaving the "Instagram" account.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable lifestyle brand for the last moment to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angry Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say that Jones was "sent" when during the intense meeting on Tuesday, a golden television girl admitted at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Bakinghamshire, that due to new transactions amounting to GBP 1.5 million, she would not have enough time to devote his household goods and accessories to the Truly brand.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and it was assumed that it would have doubled the assets of Mr Willoughby 11 million pounds.
Since 37-year-old H. Willoughby reported that he was leaving Truly in the Instagram account, Jones went from Britain to one of his summerhouses.
The source said: "Truly" has been one of the most important priorities of Holly so far.
This was her long-term future, which will last for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou has a full warehouse of ready-made goods for sale."
Experts believe that the lead of The Morning, which is one of the most financially successful British stars, can cost the company millions of investment in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household items, as well as from delays in starting things.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The three children’s mother, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby and Cappu founded Truly, and 52-year-old Jones joined as President.
The couple are on vacation together, and Mr Jones has 40% of the shares of the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace ITV's I'm A Celebrity leader Antas McPartlin.
A close source of Jones said yesterday, "We're not going to comment on his business."
We talked hard and "we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism of the media about a comment that some might regard as "non-presidency", as well as the fact that they are so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
A short funny voice of the "new host" said:
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting since their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on the striggising of nuclear disarmament.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not receive a "appropriate response" from the US on North Korea's early disarmament.
He noted that the USA is instead continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
A brief speech expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
- We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We are now in this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: it was the completion of missile testing, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to enter this stuffed arena, we’ll have about 200 people standing here,” said Trumpas, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were deployed, this was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" prepares a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether employees working abroad will be able to work locally.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other shores.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to lead to an increase in the number of deaths.
In the best time, travelling between many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok, where victims of an earthquake are being treated, sails to Palau, but it will reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days’ time.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of the Indonesian infrastructure as his election campaign centre, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
The lack of funding, however, has made the administration of Jacob restless, since he will be reinstated in the elections in the coming years.
Nothing is also under pressure from the continuing tensions of sectarians in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1 000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, arrows and other simple weapons.
Watch out: Liverpool player Daniel Sturrigge beats a distant levelling goal in the matches with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from winning the Chelsea Premier League's 89-minute match on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
As their team lags behind the result of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He beat the ball on his left foot and hit it to the far edge.
High above the fine ground, the raised ball flew to the right upper corner of the net.
He finally ran over Keppa's jumped Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far as possible in front of me, so I just tried to keep as long as possible for a blow,” Sturridge said LiverpoolFC.com.
- I saw a run in Cante, and with one touch I straightened the ball and, without thinking too much, I just kicked."
After 25 minutes of stabbing by the Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea from the first head of the podium 1:0.
During that attack, the "blue" attacker returned the ball to Mateo Kovaciui with his heel in the middle of the square and hurried towards Liverpool.
In the middle of the square, the wall was quickly played.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who was invading, between his opponents.
Hazard bypassed the defenders and passed through Liverpool player Alice Becker by a left leg blowing the ball into the net to the far bulwark.
The Liverpool team will play with Napoli at Stadio San Paolo (Italy) in the Champions League group stage at 15.00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea meets Videoton on Thursday at 15.00 at the UEFA European League.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is now 832
As reported earlier Sunday by the National Disaster Agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia rose from an earthquake and a tsunami to 832.
The agency's press representative reported at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroh's press conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed due to the 7.5-point earthquake on Friday, which caused a 6-metre wave.
The city of Palu, where more than 380 000 people live, was covered with ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after the death of a woman
The murder investigation was launched after the woman’s body was found this morning in Berkenhed, Mersisaid.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. at Graison Muse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called upon people who had seen or heard in the territory to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “As long as the investigation is under way, I would like to address everyone who was near John’s street in Berkenhed and who saw or heard something suspicious that they could contact us.
I would also like to contact everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured someone on the video recorder and contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhed and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigations are still ongoing, as the police have reported that they inform the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Graison Muse, just tried to return to his apartment, but the police said that nobody could enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when he learned what happened.
The residents have now been informed that they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard how a police officer explained to one person that the whole territory is now considered a crime scene.
The woman turned out to be a bit pale at the scene of the crime.
She kept saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside side, and another van – behind it on the outside side.
Many officials stood on the inside side of the barrier and watched the block of multi-apartment buildings.
For every person with information, please write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimetoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statues are being struck by the last blow to the "rewriting" of history.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, which resembles the actions of the Taliban, under the responsibility of the fanatical Puritonic followers of Cromwell.
However, the Cromwell Society described the offer by J. Crickas as "the fooly" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the transposition of statues by Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace, the statue would inevitably have become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The wonderful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith "The Sunday Telegraph" said: "At the end of the 19th century, many people, perhaps more than today, were regarded by Cromwell as the defender of the parliament from external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether the picture is complete or not, historians argue so far.
One thing is clear: the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed a further development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements, as the Lord's defender, are also worthy of mention and honor."
Swine murderer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked the market in southwestern China and killed the farmer.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found. Due to the damaged artery he was bloody and lying next to the piggy in the Lupansu market in Guidjou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Sininga, China, prepared to give vaccines to pigs.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Junan, he was going to travel to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The following morning, his cousin found his relative dead and found the door open to the nearby pig.
He said there was a big boar in the pig, whose mouth was dirty with blood.
According to the report, the court report confirmed that a pig weighing over 250 pounds [250 kg] had ruined a farmer.
Guyang Evening News quotes: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said his cousin, stating his name was Wu.
The security camera film showed Yuan, who entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan, or his cousin, did not belong to an animal that broke a man.
The market leader reported to Evening News that the pig had to be locked to stop attacking other people and keep until the police are collecting evidence on the ground.
Yuano's family and market authorities are reported to be negotiating compensation for death.
Although few cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the husband was particularly injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [195 kg] pushed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed until the animal was driven by a wife.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggressive can be caused by the taste of blood.
“They are just playful.
They love biting, very curious... not willing to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
The "remains" of Urgan Rose will bring great rain to the southwest of the USA
Hurricane Rose is predicted to weaken by moving through cooler waters along the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring plenty of rains to the whole of North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5 a.m., Rosa moved 137 km/h as a Category 1 storm and was 620 km south-west of the Euchenian Cape (Mexico).
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side is beginning to form a vast area of low pressure and is moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry great tropical humidity to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday Rose will cause up to 15 inches [25 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching extended low - pressure area, will over the next few days bring a large amount of rain to the southwest.
Instead of the rain, it will cause a dangerous sudden flooding of 2.5 to 10 cm [2.5 to 10 cm], a stream of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, will result in precipitation of between 1 inch [5 - 8 cm] per hour.
5 to 8 centimetres of rain is expected in southwestern regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Due to the shrinking nature of tropical rains, there is a potential for sudden flooding and a rapid deterioration of conditions.
In the face of a tropical storm, a particularly bad idea would be to take a walk into the desert.
The heavy canyons of rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, while thunderstorms can cause wind and dust.
The approaching expanded low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to the southern parts of the California coast.
More than one centimetre of rainfall is likely to cause a small stream of debris, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first wet season rainfall in the region.
Some of the rains of tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, and then the rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this results in huge changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas City (Missour) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from that of Saint Louis and Di Moino (Iowa).
Over the next few days, summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South plains to the northeast areas, warm October with a large number of prevailing temperatures of 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C].
New York's temperature is expected to rise to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C] on Tuesday, which would exceed an average of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C].
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the east of the US will be higher in the first half of October than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people watched the Bretto Kavanaugh court hearing
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the painful remarks made by the High Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and the accusations made by the woman Christine Blastey Ford of sexual violence in the 1980s.
However, the political impasse continued as the broadcasters interrupted their regular programmes because of the change in Friday's last minute: the senator of Arizona drew up an agreement for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was quite sure that Kavanaugh, who heard at a high school party, was engraving her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely sure that he was not.
Nielsen reported on Friday that perhaps more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast via the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating the number of people watching television in offices.
To explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as the football matches or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the leader of all networks, when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during the day-long court hearing.
ABC, with 3,26 million viewers, was second.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million.
A great deal of interest remained at the end of the hearing.
The main figure of Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small republican office announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when protestors shouted on him, trying to lift him to the hearing of the Court Committee.
CNN directly filmed him down when people flooded him.
“I stand here in front of you,” said one woman.
- Do you think he says the truth to the country?"
He was told: "You have power when so many women are helpless."
He said that his office had issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, he added that he would have more to say at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks were discussed directly when the Judicial Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Senate.
However, in Flake, he said that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would investigate the accusations made against the candidate in the coming week, the investigation of which was called upon by a democratic minority.
After talking to his friend, the democratic senator, Chris Coons, in part, was convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of the Flake had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kavanaugh's absence from the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister blames critics for "playing politics" for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May's interview with Sunday Times accused her of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with D. Britain's future and to undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birminga, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit" "Spaškiai" plan that Great Britain and the EU should charge each other's tariffs and said that it was "total absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting Police arrested the suspect Dytheon Simpson for death of the LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of having killed a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned in a second-degree murder.
The officers published a video of Sims and Simpson's reunion, and the police mentioned that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The WAFB branch of the CBS reports that the police took glasses from the scene and found the DNA of Simpson on them.
After hearing Simpson, the police reported that he shot Wayde deadly.
The lawyer informs you that his release security is USD 350 000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge parish’s expert service published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a shot into the head and back of the neck.
The department gives merit to the Luiziana State Police Working Group on Refugees, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the district who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
The director of LSU sport Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for “curiousness and the enforcement of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-old guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
Last season, the young man dropped 5,6 points on average during the game and caught 2,6 falling balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "shooked" and "shocked".
"This is always thought of," Wade said.
The volcano spits ash in the city of Mexico
The Popocatepetli volcano was the source of ash that reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when increased crater activity was recorded and gas and ash emissions were recorded 183 times within 24 hours.
The center watched many thunders and earthquakes.
Photos in the social media show car windscreens covering a thin layer of ash in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Chochimilke.
The Geophysics noted that 72 km south-east of the capital volcano has increased since the 7.1-point earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Donu Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Prior to the vote on independence, the police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors for independence crossed the riot police and thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote on separation against Catalonia.
The riot police, which stopped the group of masked separatists, was covered with eggs and powder paints, which caused dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used batters to break the fight that started later in the day.
Within a few hours, the groups for independence, singing "Unforgivable, Unforgivable", faced the protesters of the Unionists who cried out: "Let Spain live!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries caused by protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region of independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but due to a large part of the voting boycotters who did not want to stand apart, the turnout was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1 000 people were injured during violent clashes last year when the police across the region tried to stop voting in polling districts.
On Friday night, independent groups set up a camp to prevent demonstrations supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer certain about the prospects of Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I watched the parents joyfully shouting those who can vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that a vital and difficult victory was plundered in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia's independence parties were hard to maintain momentum this year when many of their most famous leaders went to voluntary exile or were detained and awaited for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42 - year - old police engineer, Joan Puig, who filmed a protest on his phone, said that the conflict had led to a conflict between politicians on both sides.
"The voltage is constantly increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Orioli Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European elections next year.
"Candidation in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonder: Men who entered the house by car

At some point, the car could also have been shot with a teat.
The Menga Crush has guaranteed Livingston's victory at 1:0 against Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Livingston transferred to the upper league surprised Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard, the head of Ibrox club, to lose the second of 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be very important, because in a moment Gary Holt's team compared to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team will meet with the leaders Hearts next Sunday in this Premier League season, from which they lag behind eight points.
Prior to this, the Rangers will play games at home with the Rapid Vienna League on Thursday.
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unrivalled matches in a division to six, and Chief Trainer Holt has not yet felt the taste of defeat, because Kenny Miller was replaced only last month.
Livingston misses the odds of matches with Orthodox guests
Even before you hit the goal, Holt's team had to be in front of them long ago because of its perseverance, which raises the various problems of Rangers.
At first Scott Robinson broke and struck across the gate, and later Alan Litgow slipped, unable to reach the ball transmitted by Craig Halkett's head, and he ran near the gate.
The hosts did not worry about allowing Rangers to play in front because they knew that they could cause problems for guests by creating standard situations.
That is exactly what the decisive goal was.
Rangers has missed a free blow and Livingston has started to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson have jointly handed over the ball to Menga, and the latter, after stopping him, has gained a goal from the middle of the fine court.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers for a longer time, but the defence of the owners has been insurmountable and the goal of the goalmaker Liam Kelly was almost absent.
The game went on in the second helm, although Kelly had to work to support the blow of Alfredoed Morelos to the gate.
Scott Pittman's shot at Rangers goalist Allan McGregor hit his leg, and after the next Livingston standard position, the ball was running next to the gate.
When the ball was transferred, it was constantly found on the Livingston penalty court, but every time it was kicked out, and two requirements for imposing a penalty – one due to the collision of Halkett with Glenn Middleton, who ran into the square after the change, and the other due to the ball’s hand – was not satisfied.
Analysis of the Phenomenal Livingston Performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Meði Arena
Phenomenal Livingston game and result.
They were perfect for all to one and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff have almost not changed since they returned to the top league, but great merit should be given to Holt because when he arrived he lit the team.
He was assisted by many heroes.
Captain Halkett played wonderfully, bringing together a well - organized defense, and Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play great under Gerrard, they did not have enough to reach their level this time.
They had few decisive strokes and only once broke through the defence of hosts. A certain alarm bell for the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne was met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey outside Turkey.
The police forbade 25 000 people to come in front of the mosque for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German Government to meet him in their own country.
Different protests point to the division of visitors: some Turkish Germans treat him as a hero and others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. When faced with a car a biker died
In London, a cyclist was killed when he faced a car.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn streets, the busy road of Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10.15 p.m.
The car driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died in place.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, hit by the perpetrator who then fled, some 1.6 miles [1.6 km] from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that officials are trying to identify the person and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officials were injured during the turmoil
The prison service reported that six prison officers were injured during a major upheaval in a prison of special security men.
The confusion took place in HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusefir on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m., where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were summoned to take control of this disorder, involving eight prisoners and taking place in a single wing of prison.
Officials shall be treated against minor facial injuries at the site of the event.
A representative of the prison service said: "In order to manage the ongoing incident, specially trained prison staff were invited to the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that those responsible will be given to the police and that they will probably spend longer than bars."
HMP Long Lartin is held in prison by more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison manager was reported to be treated in a hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were summoned to prison to control a serious breakdown in which some workers were thrown into billiards.
Hurricane Rose threatens Finix, Las Vegas, Solt Lake City with its rapid floods (this can be useful for dry areas)
It is not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen next week, when the storm Rosa with its remaining energy will collapse through the southwest of the desert and this will pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced the surprise of the sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, which is spreading towards the south and east of Nevada, south-eastern California and Jutta, including Finix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
It is expected that, on a late Monday, as she approaches the rain, on Tuesday Rosa will draw straight to Finixa.
In Finixe, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression no more than 322 miles [322 km] from Finix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Urgent Centre predict that the precipitation of 5 to 10 centimetres is expected to reach 5 centimetres in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim.
Other parts of the desert southwest, including the central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between two inches [2.5 cm] and three inches [5 cm] [5 cm] [6 cm] [5 cm] [6 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 cm] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5 m] [5
For people who do not suffer from sudden flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from these rainfalls, as the south-west is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the US Drought Monitoring Centre, slightly more than 40% of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which corresponds to the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose travels to the coast throughout the California Peninsula, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, who still ranks as a storm with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is 619 miles [619 km] south of Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm faces cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore raging.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitations falling in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the north-west Sonora is expected to reach 8-15 centimetres, but perhaps up to 25 centimetres of rainfall," said weather.com.
Then Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then, Tuesday morning, to the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and Tuesday late evening, through Arizona, as a southern Jutta.
“The main risk expected from Rose or its remains is the very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, in the north-west Sonora and in the south-west of the US desert,” reported the National Urgent Centre.
It is estimated that these rains will cause life - threatening rapid floods, the stream of debris in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Invading Midsamer Norton. Arrested four people suspected of trying to kill
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were detained in a suspected attempt to kill after a young 16 - year - old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton in the "Excelsior" terrace area, about 04.00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is now in a stable state.
The police of Eivon and Sommerset reported that 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock district.
The officials turned to all those who could have any material on the mobile phone about what happened.
A short note says that Kavanaugh "was affected by the Party of Democrats' folly and anger".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the cruel and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," he said in his speech in Vilinga, Western Virginia.
He said that during his nomination process, Kavanaugh “had experienced the malices of the Democratic Party, anger. ”
Kavanaugh testified to the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blastey Ford's accusation that he had attacked her sexually several decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified to his charges during the trial.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw that day how great, noble, and brave Kavanaugh was.
– Vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation in the field of public services," said the crowds of Western Virginia's supporters.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican electoral activity in the middle elections.
“Five weeks have passed before the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate, although I actually participate,” he said.
- That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
A brief statement was that the democrats are trying to "false and hinder".
Senior GOP Assistant to CNN said that the first most important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many being hurled to death by the huge waves that hit the beach, when a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulavesi Indonesia.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the Palu Beach Festival, when the waves of six meters [6 m] high began to climb the coast when they were darkened. Many of them were deadly sewed and destroyed everything that had happened on the road.
After the tsunami, an earthquake of 7.5 points occurred.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the BNPB Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency during the information report in Jakarta.
- The tsunami did not break itself, he pulled back cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho and added that the tsunamis were running at 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
He said that some people went into the trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palos.
The images from the air from the agency of natural disasters showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were bent and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city continued to be shaken by repeated blows.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPT) reported that on Friday's particularly severe earthquake, energy emissions exceeded about 200 times the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It has been reported that tsunamis could be strengthened because of the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received from Dongala.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there," said the representative of the Red Cross in the statement, adding that workers and volunteers travel to areas affected by the disaster.
It was said that "it can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials said that the waves came after the announcement of the warning.
In the popular social media amateur material you can hear a man on the top floor of the building shouting about the approaching tsunami for people standing below the street.
In a few minutes, a water wall takes away buildings and cars to the shore.
Reuters could not confirm the film immediately.
As a result of the earthquake and the tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted and communications networks around Palu were cut off, and the authorities found it difficult to coordinate aid.
The authorities reported that the troops from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo planes with relief supplies, but that the person evacuated still needed food and other essential supplies.
The airport was opened again for aid purposes only and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widod planned to visit Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Dozeba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongala went safely to Palu, where the employees were in the tarpaulin tents, built in the office yard, the sights were destroyed along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when the relief teams started to take difficult steps to provide assistance in the event of a disaster, some people complained that they had many experience in foreign assistance workers had been banned from travelling to Palas.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and personnel employed from abroad can only help once the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
- When the government says, "Yes, it's a national disaster", we can call for international assistance, but this status has not yet been published."
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and loved ones of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would be part of a miracle that would affect a gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the pool.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was pressed under the ruins next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two missing paragliders of Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those stuck in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagis, were his students.
"Because I am older in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon described in detail how, in a few hours, after declaring the fall of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled around the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages contained only one gray, not two blue cranberries.
"I think this means that no messages have been received," he said.
When filling the ATM, thieves stole 26 750 US dollars in the entertainment center "Newport on the Levee"
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning the thieves stole 26 750 US dollars from a staff member of Brink's who was filling a ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment centre.
"The driver of the car was an empty ATM in the entertainment complex and ready to add more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "flagged from behind Brink's employee's back" and stole a bag of money.
According to a press release, the Witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police were unable to identify the number of people involved in the crime.
Every person with information about their identity should contact the Newport police by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reper changed his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Having announced changes in the Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "A person previously officially known as Kanye West".
For 41 years, Mr West has been called Ye for some time and named it the eighth album that was released in June.
The change started before the show "Saturday Night Live" where West was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He must replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the performance for “emotional reasons,” – said the creator of the show.
It is not only a shortening of the current professional name – K. West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you" in the Bible," said Mr West earlier this year when he spoke about the album title with the radio conductor Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
Albums more reflect who we are."
He is one of many well-known rappers who change their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the names of the preferred Love and Brotherly Love.
Former Wester's colleague, JAY-Z, also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrésas Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use troops against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use military forces against the civilian population when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students is approaching in the country.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Taltelolco Square " never use military forces to tame the people of Mexico".
On 2 October 1968, at the time of the start of the left-wing student movements across Latin America, military forces shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by subsidising students monthly and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities involved young people in criminal groups.
US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
"Since China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments have been received since various US government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even if the US does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy at all.
In the meantime, China presented last year its plan to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected to see another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee said in an interview this week with CNBC.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of Work Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the top-ranking American Othello player and was later head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technology competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency's "Robotic Challenge", and asked when he was next to help find more people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to make a hard effort to win state grants.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders away – it's companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to step up efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences finances the people of academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organisations are spending money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre to involve partners from industry and academics, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA (the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency) announced an investment of approximately USD 2 billion for AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the area of artificial intelligence.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would be an action to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with Greece, which blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the province of Macedonia is located, claims that its northern neighbour means claims on Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalists argue that changing the name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavs of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The referendum question was put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO membership and the EU's agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that would have been affected by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, young Macedonians so that they can live freely, they are protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they will follow the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be needed to replace the name.
The State Electoral Commission informed that no reports of violations had been made by 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters gave their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter of Skopje.
Parliamentary Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name in order to open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents, which were built for a boycotting referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads and not through the service door,” said Kawadarkov.
- We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and take part in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that the result "Yes" would be "the assurance of our future".
According to the survey results published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of respondents are going to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they'd vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successfully held, 50 per cent of voters plus one vote must take part in it.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took over power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all Brighton defenses and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, achieved a victory result of 2:0.
Aguero beat the goal at 65 minutes, it would seem incredibly easy.
Argentinian attacker in the middle of the square got the attack at the beginning.
Before he broke into the open field, he ran between three Brighton defenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He broke through one defender, before overtaking several others at the edge of the Brighton fine court.
Then he passed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English attacker returned the ball to Aguero with one spring from the fine ground and the right leg hit the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming the Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has a problem with its feet,” said the Head of City, Pep Guardiola.
- We said he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he's got a goal for that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues to get ahead with these Premier League matches.
The goal is earned at 29th minute.
During that attack, Aguero received the ball while at the depth of Brighton's court.
On the left side of the square between two opponents, he hand over the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane was driving the ball forward with a few kicks until Sterling pushed towards his further whirlwind.
The Sky Blues attacker launched the ball into the gate just before slipping out of the square.
On Tuesday, 12 noon 55 min., City meets with Hoffenheim Champions League group in Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were no reasons left to play again.
The competitive Scherzer hopes to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the opportunity to survive the playoffs; in the national league West they are one point ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies, which won the Nationals on Friday night at 5:2 at least gave you a chance to get a preferential road map, but still will have to try to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Even though we play for nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and other teams will gather, will probably be at the highest level that we will achieve this year.
Why not talk?"
Nationals have not yet announced the startup composition of the Sunday match team, but they are clearly inclined to throw the Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the structure of this game, on Thursday became a throw-out trainer and will take the position of the beater on his usual day of rest – Sunday.
Washington right-handed statistics for this season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 woven over 220 2/3 lifting.
A brief speech in Western Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-term elections, the President indirectly mentions the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
It is five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I don't run... but I really run, that's why I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he continued: – You see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see how it happens right now.
And they are determined to restore power by any means, and see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don't care what they hurt, how they climbed over to gain power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission "to resist and hinder".
"And you see it for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "the wicked, the disgusting, the lowly and the wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Committee on Courts, citing the name of the democratic senator Dianne’s Feinstein, which created huge innovations for the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Hey, hm, like.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinions openly
When Momentum activists voted in my local party for distrust of me, I don't know if it should have been surprising.
Finally, I am the most recent Labour MPs who have been told that I am unwanted, and this is for their opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
I was distrusted by criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want to see many members involved in the meetings and to make the meetings productive."
For most of the eight years that I am a local Labour Parliamentary Member, Friday evening's GC meetings were exactly the same.
It is sad that today, the tone of many meetings is not the same and the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is intolerant and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues, whom I had previously believed were similar in political terms, began to expect me to turn around at an angle of 180 degrees and follow opinions I never agreed with, whether for national security or for the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and even no matter what – there are a series of insults on social networks that encourage my cancellation, the politics of the center is condemned and it is said that I am not a place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have been more successful than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure sexualistic and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbynas said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with every 'untrust' procedure or amendment of the electoral system, this party is getting weaker and weaker.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep out, not to talk so loudly, and then "all things will be fine" with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which in the sense of which my entire school class has collapsed, I have been trying to gain better public services for those most in need, whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No-one in the Nottingham East should in any way be surprised at my political opinions and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who have encouraged this procedure every Friday, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have from Nottingam Momentum addressed to my constituents, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise you that no threats of cancellation or political necessity will prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and all your best interests.

"Ayr"- "Melrose" – 38:17 An insurmountable "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this moment of triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent's Premiership day matches.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one that has not been overcome.
In the end, they had a good defense and well - exploited opportunity to win, so the coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We have raised all the tests during all the matches that have taken place so far, and we are still invincible, so I am truly happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr" turned out to be good, and players used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazzier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released by Warriors on the field, allowed Melrose to collect figures, and Baggot stopped the ineffectual attempt.
Climo increased the advantage of "Ayr" by the fine, when before, in the middle of the match, earned points and completed the personal test with results, helping "Ayr" to unwind the result at 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second keel well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggote, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was stopped for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken out of the field on the carriers.
Captain Ayr Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the surplus of players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt after severe pressure was ineffective.
The player in the home team came back, but after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the fine line for the continuing Ayr fight.
Clime has successfully completed its test, as it had already done since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe arrested David Armstrong's spring at the corner of the square and prevented Gregor Henry, a country attacker, from holding the fifth home team's attempt to gain points.
“Still Game” star seems ready to start a new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to move to the accommodation and catering sector when it turns out that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes and plays scripts with Greg Hemphill, his long-standing comedy partner.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of this release, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although "Scottish Sun" sources mentioned that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "restaurant business".
"We own the sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, expects the court to open the way to the ocean again
Sailors shall patrol at the Navy headquarters in La Pase.
The flag of the ocean’s blue lies on public buildings.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with the slogan: “We are legitimately owned by the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia all over the land, there are still still memories of access to the ocean that Chile was sacrificed for resources in the 19th century bloody conflict – a lively and longing to reinvigorate in the Pacific.
The hopes of the last decades have now been greatly strengthened, as, after five years of reflection, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice judgment, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is concentrated in the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, looks forward to achieving positive results", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the announcement of the ITT decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint, which will oblige Chile to negotiate access to the sea by the Bolivian State.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia's Indian, who is waiting for a controversial electoral struggle for the reelection, is also very interested in the end of Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will make a favourable decision in Bolivia — even if it were to do so — that there would be little change.
The UN body located in the Netherlands has no power to cut off Chile's territory and indicated that it would not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the CJEU will be published only six months after the final arguments have been heard is hardly an indication that the case "was not complicated", – said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law of Chile.
And even if Bolivia has made some progress, the last four years could have ruined it back.
"This issue of access to the sea was raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill have been destroyed by the vengeful Morales rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after all, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, spokesperson of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the judgment was taken abnormally quickly.
"On Monday Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start the era of new relations with Chile and to end the 139-year-long disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, assures us that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour its promises agreed by the leaders of the rival countries at their meeting in Singapore.
His comments were presented at a time when Secretary of State Mikeł Pompeo seemed to have been planning to renew stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Ri says that the "utopian dream" is that the continuation of sanctions and the US's withdrawal of the declaration on the end of the Korean war could ever cause North Korea to fall.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take convincing disarmament action.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread sceptical opinion that Pyongyang is not going to give up the arsenic that the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second Kim and Trump meeting.
The Paris Fashion Show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne, in their spring and summer collections of 2019, presented a wide range of eccentrically large headwear, and he simply impressed the viewers of the Paris Fashion Week in his style.
These extremely unpractical hats have conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers have presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive work of Valentin was a huge body - colored hat decorated with a wide, feather -like edge surrounding the head of the manikin.
Other accessories of non-standard size were gemstoned watermelons, sorcerer hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn in their lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than the high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a nare suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and another resembled a melt of dissolved ice cream.
And if you follow this huge trend of fashion – you won't ask.
Stylish experts predict that these huge covers can be accessed by shops.
The huge hats were popular with La Bomba's high heels, they were worn by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created extremely unpractical hats, which conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a straw bag of the beach, almost the same size as the one carrying it to wear a bathing suit.
The red brick-colored raffia basket, decorated with raffia needles and white leather handle, has become the exclusive accent of the Jacques collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Lukes Armitages said to FEMAIL: "I think that next summer, huge hats and beach bags will arrive in stores, because the designer has had such a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard-sized accessories."
John Edward: "Speaking is a key skill for the citizens of the world"
Scotland's independent schools have improved the record of academic achievements, keeping pace in 2018, and once again demonstrated the exceptional results of the exams, which have only been reinforced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30 000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their career choices and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the planned school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are willing to meet in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you are able to speak to a person in a language that he understands, he will understand you.
If you talk to him in his own speech, you'll talk his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relations and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams, we can say that languages are at the top of popularity and that independent schools have the best maintenance ratings.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the highest A rating.
Data from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A score during the Mandarin test, 72 percent received the highest A score in German, and 69 percent received the highest A score in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider the knowledge of foreign languages to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered to be as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that 17 percent of all the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill jobs were insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required to prepare young people for their future careers.
As access to employment will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses when learning a second language, he or she will be much better off than others in the future if he or she has these skills that are necessary for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will make people learning several languages more competitive.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4 000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the interview, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for the children of today.
By teaching several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important language in the United Kingdom, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever the best interests of your child, there will always be many languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are ready to create a learning environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not denied that, in today's global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and results for Scotland's young people.
This must be done.

LeBron to start the "Lakers" debut on Sunday in San Diego
There is little room for fans to see how LeBron James will start the season in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakeers' coach Lukes Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday season opening competition with Denver's Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's gonna be a little bit of a minute. It's still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Lakers' reporter Mikełas Trudelas said in the Twitter account that James is likely to play for a limited period of time.
This week James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during six pre-seasonal matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any more pre-seasonal matches to get ready," he said.
A short speech in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his campaign tonight in Vilinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled short languages next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the approval of the procedure for suspending the nomination of the candidate of the Supreme Court in the vote, Trump seeks to mobilise support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans were threatened with losing control of Congress in November.
A few hours tonight will take place in the short language of Western Virginia and how to watch it online?
A short speech in Vilinga, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018
You can watch a short speech in Western Virginia online on YouTube.
The short one will probably touch on this week's topic for the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, because it has sowed a lot of tension due to suspicions of improper sexual behaviour when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination until the week before the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main aim of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign states that the aim of these five meetings next week, as Reuters announces, is "to energise volunteers and supporters in their efforts to protect and extend the majority held by the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he starts a very hot campaign season," said Trumpa's campaign representative who did not want to reveal his name.
"The planned language of Vilnius "Wesbanco" should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media attention of Pittsberg," says Metro News of West Virginia.
On Saturday, Short for the second time in the last month will visit West Virginia, a state where won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
A brief try to help the West Virginia candidate for the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to surveys is in the low-rated.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to try to get him to the top of the ratings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
The 2018 Ryder Cup tournament: The US team is military and expects to enter the Sunday Unit Event
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, fours can be exactly what needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuating of success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions such as these.
So on whose side is there success now?
"They were first six points, and now four points, so I guess we can count it as a bit of a success," said Jordan Spietheha in preparation for the day.
Europe is, of course, the leader, has a four-point score and is still waiting for twelve matches.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, according to Spietho, is exhausted, and they do not miss it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spiech was invincible from the beginning to the end and impeccablely the leader.
As the round continued, those wild victories of victory became increasingly famous. Thomas gained two points from two possible ones in order to finish the fourth match.
His blow, which had won them in this match at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar shoutings that said to the American team that the end was not coming.
"You just need to focus and take care of your match," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players is left to play separately.
To a successful end – 18 pits.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwoods, the story of the Ryder Cup is indisputable.
A strange but charming couple from Europe have collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not need any extra blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This course of events and the reaction of the victorious viewers only confirm that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will succeed in achieving the same popularity as Fleetwood or Molinar, who have the chance to make Europe a victory after the last sunrise of Le Golf National.
It would be good for both to succeed at the same time in different pits.
Although it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of four balls, when he was paired with Alex Norren.
An extra blow and two double extra blows through the first nine series of wells pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into trouble from which they could not get out.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four match so interesting to observe due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and do not give, and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe was better at playing as a team, so with determination it came to the final stage, but this quadrupulous stage has also shown that the US team has a fighting spine, which some, especially in states, have doubted.
On the last day of the "Ryder" Cup, Europe takes the lead at 10:6
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will be welcomed with a weighty weight, taking the first fourths of Saturday before the United States at 10:6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwoodo and Francesco Molinario's duo, it continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard fighter Tiger Woods and took the lead in Le Golf National's four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to preserve the trophy that had been lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the four-year-old match against the failed American side and completed the stage 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in fours when winning two matches but unable to overcome the score
Jim Furyk's half needs eight points out of the 12-unit match on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row when Molliwood, together with Molinari, duplicated after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four match in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they flawlessly crushed the loss of confidence in Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau for even better result 5:4.
Woods, who had otherwise failed two Saturday matches, at some times showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his match fours, seven in a row.
Justin Rose® rested in the morning's fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stanson in the fours; they overcame 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Broox Koepk, the world's first and third ranks.
Even though it was a pleasant day with a mild wind in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not go all along like butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Spiech and Justin Thomas raised a cartel for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won a hard victory at 2:1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in the four-ball match, defeated Paulter and Rory McLroy's score at 4:3, without smashing the ball into the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team managed to regain the score of four points by going to single matches, although Furyk's half would have enough equals to keep the trophy.
Although there were two days in second place, Sunday’s success seemed to have turned away.
North Korea says that it will never disarm itself without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen their distrust over the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
The General Assembly of the Rio Yong Ho World Organisation said that North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill” over recent years, such as the suspension of nuclear missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear test base and its commitment not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive a similar response from the US," he regretted.
"With no confidence in the US, we will not be able to rely on our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm."
While Ri repeated the complaints already heard by North Korea about Washington's resistance to the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be rewarded during its steps of action, his statement was distinguished by the fact that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on “the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the 1950s and 1953s Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by forced methods, even by abandoning the declaration on the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that sanctions can cause us to stumble is the same thing as people who don’t care about looking for utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Short meeting, which was highlighted by the US leader in the United Nations a little earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months: "If another country had been South Korea on this issue of nuclear disarmament and not the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech changed dramatically compared to last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Evil's President" Trump named Kim a "missile gentleman", who was preparing a suicide mission, it was absolutely inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles to the US.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to 'destruct' North Korea completely last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the requirements for nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Michel Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must be continued decisively without any concessions until the final demonstration of nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has supported with all votes the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the backstages of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to pave the way for the next meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he left Pyongyang saying that all progress was only to declare North Korea in a few hours' time that he had made "gangsterical demands".
North Korea promised this month at its meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile base and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim claimed that those "appropriate measures" he sought were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the tendency to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of their students to sleep more in order to fight growing match culture in studios, caffeine and nighttime sleep
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often lack basic knowledge about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brig City, a specialist at Women's Hospitals, has developed a course that, according to him, is the first one of this kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effects of sleeplessness on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, “Why is this only about me now, in the last year of my studies?”
She said that nobody had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he said, "The Telegraph."
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains how the most important quality sleep habits help students to achieve academic and sporting results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services department of the University, said that the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The hourly rate shall include a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photo of the dormitory room where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects sports results and how important walking sleep routines are.
In the following section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of students' town with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We ensure that this will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the consequences for health when you choose to smoke," Professor Czeisler explained.
The culture of pride not to sleep overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing problem of sleep deficit.
"To ensure that enough and high-quality sleep has taken place, there should be a secret weapon of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety,  says he – even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep turns the brain into a hunger regime, so students are constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to hold a course when he attended one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive body.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm clock when it is time to go to sleep, just like the rising one, and avoid the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and light-emitting diode lighting, because they can beat your circadian rhythm out of balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": The Men's Gate saddened Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone managed to overcome Steven Gerrard's weakened result of 1:0.
Ibrox hoped to win its first victory on the trip after the triumph of February 4:1 "St Johnstone", but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrards for the second time in the 18th match at the head of the team, and now the latter team is eight points behind the “Hearts” leaders who have fled.
The menga beat seven minutes before the break, but the Rangers who played without inspiration did not see an opportunity to equalize the result.
Rangers has now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and only one gate is behind Hibernian.
The concerns of Rangers do not stop because, most likely, the butter from the tribunals hit the side judge Calum Spence and wounded him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to bypass Ayr and lead him to the Betfred Cup's semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same monk who last week took away the point from Hearts, and he would have liked how his well thought-out combinations were locking opponents at every step.
Rangers dominated by controlling the ball, but having it, Livingston did more.
They could have beat him for the second minute, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who was running to Allan McGregor's gate, with a close blow, but the safety ruined his chances by directing the ball away from the gate.
After a far off attack by Keaghan Jacobs, the free-bang ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner defender Alan Lithow asked for a way through.
Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was only hope and not faith in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfred Morelos thought he deserved a fine when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took his hand to the Colombian complaints.
Rangers' first knee was only able to hit twice, but the former goalr of Ibrox Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibally's head or a gentle sale of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th Minute of Livi may not have matched the course of the game, no one will dispute that they deserved it only for their efforts.
"Rangers" and once again failed to overcome the viscosity of Jacobs' defense.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained restraint and handed Menga over for easy completion.
During the break Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security played Morellos, but the impressively played Kelly ran away from the blow.
Livingston involved guests in such a game as they liked – with the distant transfers of the Lithowo and Halkett ball.
The Holto team could have increased its weight at the end, but McGregor defended himself from Jacobs' blow after the feeding of Lithowas from the corner.
After changing to the square, the Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed at the end of the match for a fine after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson did not respect him again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it's 136 years ago and MORE... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
The Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later created a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become a hit of the world of science and later a hit of popular culture, when in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film, cowboys were played by scientists Royłus Rogers and Dalełas Evans:
He said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms touching radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Hey, now it's really shooting!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But after receiving his name, the invention continues to exist.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system how to see bad cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has trained the immune system to recognise the bad cells, which is part of the treatment
The method involves the collection of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
Then the cells can “see” proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injected back
The trial vaccine has produced promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
In one woman who has received this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise the bad cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves recovering immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory, and then the cells can see proteins that are specific to HER2 cancers and then re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum,” explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and learned how to target cancer cells, has been successful in treating leukaemia.
Kanye, West, released the Short Supporting Tirade, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance at the SNL show.
That didn't end with the good
After an independent performance at the “Saturday Night Live” studio, the audience was ashamed of the shoutings of Canyé West, who praised US President Donald Trump; he said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song Ghost Town that night, wearing a hat with the inscription Make America Great, continued to condemn the democrats and express support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, "How can you like Short, for he's a racist?"
Well, if racism had a problem with me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show started with a comical scene where Matt Damon mocked at the Brent Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's court committee on charges of improper sexual behaviour by Christine Blastey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, the filmed material with West’s rejoinders was introduced into social networks by the comedian Chris Rockas.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind his head covering.
“They mocked me backstage.
He told me not to go there with such a hat.
They mocked me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner."
West went on to say: “Do you want to see what the bottom is?
Start to love."
His speeches at least twice caused shoutings against the audience and members of SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, as Variety reports. One person told the media: "In all the studio there was a deadly silence."
West was invited to immediately replace singer Arian Grande because her former boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West was embarrassing many by his performance, where he performed song I Love It, wearing a "Perrier" bottle suit.
He received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA Candace Turner, who published a record in the Twitter account: "For one of the bravest spirit people: Thank you FOR THE STANDING MY."
But Karen Hunter, the head of the conversation program, published a record in the Twitter account that West was just "been himself, and it's extremely amazing."
“But I choose not to see a person (buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) whose beliefs are poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced in the Twitter account that his name had changed and that he is now officially known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator who changed his name, but went on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
My colleague rapper Snoop Dog was originally called Snoop Lyon; the music legend Prince has changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

The Star of Capital Wars Other Harington criticises a distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington was famous as a sword-waving character, John Snow HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages of the Capital Wars.
But 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of a match hero who claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be cool to be respected.
Speaking about “Sunday Times Culture”, another said that he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to combat the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old colleague of the City Wars, admitted that this topic "residually touched upon him".
“I feel that I am now deeply concerned about this subject. Where did we make a mistake in developing masculinity?” he asked.
"What do we teach growing men that we are facing such problems?"
Another believes that, in part, this distorted wave of masculinity could be responsible television because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is learned?
What does this teach us on television or on the street that young people believe that they should be known for this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important questions of our time – how do we change it?
Obviously we made a mistake with young men somewhere."
He also confirmed by an interview that he would not participate in any prehistory or continuations of the "Seat Wars" when the series ended next summer, and said that "he already had enough battlefields and horses".
Since November, another film will be filmed in the modern version of “True West” by Sam Shepard. It is a film about a film about a film director and his brother robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in the creation of the “Seat Wars” – there he met his wife Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
“Emmy” award-winning fantastic series Rose played Igrīte and another character John Snow's love object.
The couple married Leslie's family property in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in HIV/AIDS infections among citizens.
According to health authorities, over 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of newly infected people were sexually transmitted, which is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But this reduced the number of people infected with HIV to almost zero, said representatives of Chinese health institutions at a conference in the province of Junano.
However, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 over time.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised as early as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are ultimately married to women.
Most cases of infection with the disease are due to inappropriate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as one way to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have leaked data from the Republican senator, condemn "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
On Saturday, US representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of its employees published personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of the legislators Wikipedia.
L. Angelo’s democrat assured us that the accusations were made by experts from the right-wing ultra-right wing and websites.
"Melas, lies and once again derogatory lies," said Waters in their Twitter account.
The information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike® Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from U.S.A.
The information on the Internet appeared on Thursday and was announced by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time when charges of sexual abuse were investigated in the Senate against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information appeared a little later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
"On conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, it was reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records relating to the Waters office and to disclose the information of the Waters staff member," reported from the Capitol.
“These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies”, continued Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false allegations, is under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism from the Internet, including from the former representative of the White House for the press Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry," Fleischer wrote.
“It says that she does not have enough restraint to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't defend himself.
He should not question the cause of the accused.
He should be calm and humble."
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare Waters' reaction with the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at Thursday's meeting.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is participating in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts in the Twitter account.
"It's true, if it's not a lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the authorities and enforcement bodies concerned of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the organisers are clarified,  says she, "that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
Review of the comedy "Jonis Inglišas is blowing again" – exhaled spy show with Rowan Atkinson
The same can be said about the revitalisation of the action spy comedy "Jonis Inglišas" – "Jonis Inglišas" was launched in 2003, and in 2011 returned to the screens with the comedy "Jonis Inglišas Resurrection".
Is this sarcastic car about how we obviously messed up, becoming a new opportunity for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent Johnny Inglišas has a second opportunity with wide eyes and rubber face to bring unpleasant truths to the surface ⇧ After all, the name clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English-speaking cinematographer regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, despite his claims for luxury, also acquired some qualities of inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Binne's features and a little bit of similarity to that guy, was used to create the theme of the drama Fire Transports used during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also a little based on a character about a traveler and a mysterious man who caused chaos, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising.
There's some beautiful moments in this latest Johnny Inglisch movie.
I liked when Johnny Inglisch approached the helicopter wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
The comic talent of Atkinson is obvious, but the humor itself seems breathless and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Unable to insert elements of comedy.
Humor is as if it were for children rather than adults, and the unbelieving adventures of Johnny Inglis don't look as ingenious and purposeful as Atkinson's quiet jokes in the play of Mr. Byn.
The most common topic at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker successfully broke into Britain's very secret spy Internet network and revealed the identities of all British spies in this field, which causes the agent's indignation – the unimportant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the cup of the Prime Minister, the pumped and corner-warmed character, who is already suffering from the devastating political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of the person who represents Teresa May is pressing everything he can, but in the script good material for that is not very much.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people between retired people.
This means that you're going to have to contact Johnny Ingliš, who is currently working as a school director at some fascinating institution, but who provides illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when the English proposed a School of Rock Spy Academy.
An Englishman is sent back to Whitehol to discuss an emergency situation and there agrees with his long-standing common Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough's now married man in relation to the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, a highlander girl, looks under-utilized.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to confuse all things in the secret service of Her Majesty, are taking action again and meeting with Olga Kurylenko's fatal beauty Ofelija Buletova.
The Prime Minister is dangerously screwed by a charismatic billionaire saying that he can solve the problem of British computers, namely the evil Jason Walta, which Jake Lacy plays.
English and Bough start their own odyssey: dressed in waiters, they cause a fire in the French restaurant, they cause chaos on the luxurious Volta yacht, and English starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stopframes were clear to hold on to this last series, but no matter how pleasant or savage it is, all of this resembles children’s television.
It's quite average.
As for the other movies by Johnny Inglis, I couldn't get rid of the idea: is the British film industry not able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would certainly be worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies creating a plan for the British people to work four days a week, but to pay for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but that they would be paid for five days.
It is being reported that the party wants company leaders to share savings from the artificial intelligence (DI) revolution, giving their employees a free day.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring together the same amount of salary.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country's development towards workers.
The transition to a week of four working days was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
One of the sources of the high-ranking Labour Party “The Sunday Times” said: “The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a week of four working days is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised four working days a week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The week of four working days is not party politics and is not discussed in the party."
The shadow government representative, John McDonnellis, took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
Mr McDonnellis stated that he was determined to regain power from the "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in the utilities companies.
Such plans by the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water undertakings may not recover their full share, since the Labour Government may deduct some of the damage they have suffered.
It also approved plans to involve employees on the board of the company and create equity funds so that 10% of the private sector's capital would be transferred to employees and could receive up to GBP 500 per annum dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the "60 Minutes" question as to whether the FBI's investigation into Mr Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote or its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, so the question arises as to whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Inquiry could affect the opinion of any of the Republican senators in such a way that they would not reject that judge.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the 60 Minutes interview, asks senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether it can happen that the FBI will find out something that will change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a more relaxed approach than his South Carolina colleague.
"Well, yes, of course," says Mr Kennedy.
“As I said in my meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaughu.
When these charges appeared, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He answered decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
So Mr Graham's opinion does not seem to change anything.
"I'm going to take Brett Kavanaugh, and I'm going to need really shocking charges," he says.
"For Dr. Ford – I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett is totally denying it," added Graham, in view of Christine Blastey Ford.
‘No one whom it designates shall be able to confirm this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think there's gonna be anything new."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York – an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive goal – to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in the Central Park of the Great meadow, the World Citizens' Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the real goal of the event – eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Initiative, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful contribution to raising awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But are the citizens of the world successful in achieving this goal?
Will the intention to reward people with a free concert really convince them to demand and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called climaxism, fictitious activism – people believe that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing a record on Twitter.
According to the organisers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011 the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters to promote a wide range of goals.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced USD 37 billion in commitments and policies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and declarations triggered by the Group’s actions, including the payment or collection of at least USD 10 billion.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children grow up and discover their full potential". With more than 4,700 Twitter messages, it promised to provide Rwanda with US dollars to help resolve the problem of malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the United Kingdom Government, sponsors, governments and such as you, the citizens of the World, we can make social injustice such as malnutrition a past," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, at the concert in London in April 2018.
This group also pointed out that, following 5 000 requests to improve the diet of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the nutrition power project, which will bring nutritional interventions to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asks, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The world’s citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult way to go: sometimes we will stumble and fail.
However, like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers participating in this year's event in New York City. Deborr-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will lead the event.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use fleet blockades to prevent Russian energy exports
“When necessary, Washington can use the fleet to hinder Russia’s energy access markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” says US Home Affairs Secretary Ryan Zinke, “Washington Examiner”.
Zinke states that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when acting at the invitation of the legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zinke.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this by using the fleet, can make sure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, can take a blockade, and that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to those who participated in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit group known as the U.S. "the voice of energy consumers".
He then compared Washington's methods with those applied in Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is to find a greater or smaller balance to replace fuel," he said and also called Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared to Mr Trump's administration as part of his mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, offering European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the Trump Administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, led Berlin to become a Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington's harsh opposition to this project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received a hostile reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its determination to continue this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I really do not agree with the third country's interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will seriously consider nominations during the presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, the Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that she would seriously consider the issue of presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the Holjoko Town Hall in Massachusettse E. Warren confirmed that he would consider standing as a candidate.
"The time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed authorities, they must go to the highest position," she said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
At a meeting at the town hall, Mr Warren said to President Donald Trump that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very afraid of how Donald Trump treats our democracy," she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court in Britta Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message published on Friday, Mrs Warren said that "an FBI investigation must definitely be carried out before the vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that most voters in the state of Mr Warren themselves believe that she should not stand as President in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the expected Massachusetts voters say that the senator should not participate in the elections, according to a survey conducted by the political research centre of Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Devalas Patrick was more supportive: 38 percent supported a possible candidate and 48 percent opposed.
Others discussed the names of the representatives of the Democratic Party who were nominated as candidates in 2020 – former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
J. Biden says that he will make a formal decision in January, as the Associated Press reports.
At the Donaldo Trump meeting Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq in September when he joined the military service.
In the event of an incident of domestic violence on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he is facing when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who feel the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder, and a certain injury to our soldiers, with whom they return," she said to the meeting of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
She said that the son and other veterans of the war "returned a little, they return a little bit of a hard heart, they return doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, indictment of domestic violence and of an attack on a woman, as well as incitement to report domestic violence with a gun and in the face of intruder, as reported by Dan Bennett, spokesman of Vasila Police Department.
18 states and Colombia support resistance to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new US policy of refusing to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of 18 states and this county submitted amicus curiae (a court consultant) comments in order to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reports.
The applicant’s full name in the proceedings, Grace v Sessions, initiated by the American Union of Civil Liberties against federal policy, shall not be disclosed.
She says that her partner "and members of his criminal gang" was violent against her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
In Greece, state lawyers have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives a lot of asylum applications as countries suffering from the chronic problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants moving away from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In his report on Friday, the Prosecutor General of Colombia, Karl Razino, stated that the new policy "complysed with the laws of state, federal and international law in force for decades".
"Federated law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates this principle," says amicus curiae.
In this note, lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the US economy, and that immigrants are more likely to engage in business and "provide the necessary employment services".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions directed immigration judges to stop providing asylum to those fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Shelter is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views", said Mr.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
The twofold increase in the number of victims in Palu is desperately searching for the rest of the living
The situation of the rest of the living is constantly deteriorating.
"The voltage is very high," says Risa Kusuma, 35-year-olds, reassuring her child's son in the city's evacuation centre in Palu.
“The fast is continuing to transport more and more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water."
It has been observed that people return to their homes that they have been destroyed, that they collect water, and that they are trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5-point, damaged earthquake hospitals are stuffy.
Some injured people, like Dwi Harris, who have experienced back and shoulder fractures, have been placed outside at the Palu Military Hospital – with continued severe repeated strokes in the hospital patients being treated outdoors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he tells of a severe earthquake in the hotel’s fifth - floor room, where his wife and daughter were staying.
“There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I have caught up in the ruins of the wall", – said D. Harry "Associated Press" and added that he and his family came to the city to participate in the wedding.
“ I heard a cry for help from my wife, ” he said.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with propaganda advertising
A week later, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a paid supplement to China Daily's most procurementable newspaper Des Mines Register in Iowa and accused China of influencing the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies such accusation.
“The accusation by D. Trump that Beijing is trying to influence the US elections marks a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China,” said U.S. officials to Reuters Agency.
Although it is common practice for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, and both countries are fighting at tariffs for each other's goods.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese response rates were directed to exporters from Iowa and similar countries which supported the Short Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published on Sunday in the daily Dees Mines Register, Branstad said that China "became even more taunted when it began to print propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese authorities have taken advantage of the freedom of speech and the press in America and have ordered a paid advertisement "Des Mines Register"," T.Branstad wrote.
"In the local Beijing press kiosk, you will not find any conflicting voices and create a true picture of the different views that Chinese people may have about the worrying economic trajectory of China, because the press is under the hard soles of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoided the proposal to print", but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As the mid-term elections approach, B. Kavanaugh fiasco has been deterred by the Republican voter
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been accused of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that this would lead to a negative response in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions caused by the situation are very strong, and many Republicans have already formally claimed to vote.
Such things cannot be taken away later," said Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell School of Siracusa University in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Mr Reeher expressed doubts as to whether the last minute of calls by senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national representative of the progressive group "MoveOn" on Friday.
On Friday morning the protestors read: "The November is approaching!" during the demonstration, the senate's lobby, when the republicers controlling the Committee of the Courts decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blastey Ford, kzip announced "Mic".
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will come across,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is impartial to the news site.
- People say that she was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who, although they do not like the President, often do not simply vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave his testimony, when she presented in detail the accusations of sexual harassment against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts argued that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, this could lead to anger.
"This caused great confusion to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the committee or the final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but also about how Republicans managed this situation and how Ch.B. Ford was treated,” said Guy Cecilas, director of the news channel “Priorities USA”, a group that helps democrats in elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the testimonies of Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, even though she has a little more support.
A new survey by "YouGov" shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in Mr Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they believe in Mr Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Mr Kavanaugh really or likely lied when giving the testimony, and only 30 percent thought the same about Mr Ford.
Invited by Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges made by Mr Ford and evidence from at least one other accused person, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Mr Ford swore testimony to the Senate's Committee on Courts last week, saying that Mr Kavanaugh had attacked her insanely when she was 17 years old.
Mr. Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party where they attended studying at Yale University at the 9th Dec.
The web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
The global network inventor Tim Berners-Lee is developing a new startup seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project "Inrupt" by this legendary inventor is a company whose work is based on the Berners-Lee Open Source Platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who has access to and which information.
The exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee laughed that the goal of Inrupt is to control the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
- It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It may include lists, job lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
As if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in the same browser at the same time.
The personal data online store is unique in that only the user decides who and which information can be accessed.
The company calls this a person's power through the data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills necessary to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools provided on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about changes that would turn up all business models overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a report published on Saturday by Medium, Berners-Lee states that "Inrupt's mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Web Consortium, which was founded at the University of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Mr Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel great optimism about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Honored Bernardas Vannas – the priest awarded with the Victoria Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his home city, the only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored.
Lieutenant Colonel Pastor Bernardas Vannas earned the award on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Belgrade and Lucour.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he did not know that he was awarded the highest-level award of the British army.
At the time, two grandchildren opened the memory stone in the county of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the fact that the stone was discovered just 100 years after the Grandpa was awarded the prize is "a wonderfully symbolic".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel led his battalion through the St. Kenten channel "with a very thick mist, with a heavy flotation of guns and automatic fire."
Later he rushed to the shooting line and led the line forward "especially galantically" and then himself attacked the gun and killed three combatants of the squad.
Lieutenant B. Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vanne, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “some things that will never be equal to themselves, but also a very inspiring thing for humility. ”
After the parade conducted by the Brentwood Emperor Youth Orchestra, Michel and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the crown.
Michael Vann said that he had a great honour to participate in the parade, and he added: "The courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with Kiaulytė Pepa
Imagine: You don’t go to bed all night to see the pack Bellator 206, but eventually you don’t get to see the main view.
There were 13 fights in San Josés Aphis, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were going to fight, UK audiences were surprised by the release of the film "Pepa of the Pork".
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed because it was precisely because of this fight that they did not sleep until morning.
On Twitter, one of the fans named the replacement of the broadcast with a childish cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“In accordance with the rules laid down by the government, 6 o'clock in the morning such content was inappropriate, so the program for children had to be turned on,” said Dave Schwartz, the Chief Marketing and Communication Vice-President of Belator.
"Yes, "Pep."
The president of Bellator Scott Cocker stated that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the schedules to the viewers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," said Cooker.
“But at that time there is 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve it by Sunday in our time – Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast changes, a lot of messages have been exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a question of power.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as usual. We wanted to give more to the fans, but simply failed.
It's a failure."
Desert Island Discs: Tomas Daley felt inadequate because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper to the water Thomas Daley claims that he grew up feeling weaker than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him a motivation for success.
24 Athletes said that only in primary school did they realize that they were not the same as everyone.
For the first time in the Radio 4 programme "Desert Island Discs" conducted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was beginning to speak publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a father, it was less important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the permanent leader of this long - term program, has quit her job for several months because of illness.
In the first Laverne programme, whose guests were asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabited island, Mr Daley said that he was growing less than everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said, "until these days, this feeling of weakness and otherwise was an incentive that gave me the strength to succeed."
He claimed that he wanted to prove that he was worthy of this, so that he would not let others down when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and has taken part in this year's United Nations Commonwealth Games, taking advantage of the opportunity to encourage more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he had started to talk about it publicly because he felt that he was lucky that he could live openly without consequences, and he would like to give others that hope.
Three times the world champion said that to fall in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustina Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – was unexpected.
Last year, Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar laureate, but he claims that the difference in age never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, when he survived so much when he was so young – he took part in his first Olympics only 14 years later, and three years later his father died of cancer – it is difficult to meet someone who would be of the same age, but who experienced the same heights and lows.
In June, when a couple became the parents of their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, the perspective of Mr Daley changed completely.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said that it was most important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
- But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as that of Grandpa Roberto, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old when brain cancer was diagnosed.
Mr Daley, Father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether tickets to the 2012 London Olympics had already been bought, which he intended to watch sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him it wouldn’t be long enough to sit in the first row,” said Daley.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not inviolable,” T. Daley said.
A year later, the athletes competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life – to dance into the water while watching local audiences at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling," he said.
It has also inspired the selection of the first song for the wires – Heather Small track Proud, which has responded to his feelings in preparation for the Olympics and still pleasantly rudes the skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sundays via BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 p.m. in British summer time.
Ph. Mickelson, who lost his form, missed the Ryder Cup on the bench on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will reach the record on Sunday because he will be participating in the Ryder Cup tournament 47 times already, but if it is not a successful anniversary, it will need to improve its shape significantly.
Ph. Mickelson, who has played for the 12th time in the two-year competition, has been placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day in the support team, and the rest of the team improved his technique in the field in order to correct the troubles.
Even though he did not hit the height of his career very directly, 48 athletes are not an ideal player in the squares of Le Gold National, whose long strip of rough grass is particularly unfavourable for inaccurate impact.
In addition, as if the square itself were not frightening enough, in the ninth match, which will take place on Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will play against Francesco Molinari, a very precise UK Open Tournament champion, who, together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If four points behind Americans succeed in launching the upcoming 12-unit match, the Mickelson match can become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but probably he could not speak differently.
“He understood the role he was playing today perfectly, and he ran me through my back and with his hand he said he was ready to play tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- He has no lack of self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I imagined more, but it came out like this, so we decided we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the most played sportsman of the Ryder Cup.
It may be that this will mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which is not equal to the heights of his personal records.
Mr. Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 loses and seven equals, but Furyk claims that his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think that for younger players this week it was also fun to compete with him, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great victory can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that the big edge towards the last Ryder Cup will easily turn into a hard fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in the May 1997 match in Valderam, where the team of opponents led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point score against the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with the result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a lot of weight in Valderam; we had a lot of weight in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderam, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjornas (in the photo), who watched the victory of 2018 release at 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National Square.
So history will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
It's gonna take every effort tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we need to pursue it consistently.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know well who's on the other side – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complex square, T. Bjorn added: “I would not like to get ahead of myself in any way.
Morning will be a matter of quite a different kind of hair.
Tomorrow the most important will be an individual game – this is something quite different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're alone on the field, you're testing your ability to play golf.
This idea needs to be implemented by players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything from you.
Now we're gonna have to stand out with our partner, and he's gonna have to push everything out of himself."
Unlike Mr Bjorne, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear better individually than his partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have raised three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day, because he was on a winning team before Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every fucking word,” he answered, asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
- Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but try to start quickly – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, middle matches become very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and we have released players in a way that we know... we are trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to lead a counter-fight and negotiate with Rory McIlroy in the high-level match, and among Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are leading.
"I chose these guys in this order, because I think they will successfully beat the whole game," said T. Bjorn about his choice for unit games.
The delivery of a new German military ship is postponed again
The latest fregata of the German navy was due to start work as early as 2014 and replace military ships during the Cold War, but, according to the local press, we will not see them until at least next year due to the ever-growing system and significant price increases.
According to the military representative quoted by Die Zeit newspaper, the deployment of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was darkened by the problems of the already presented ship.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships commissioned by the navy as early as 2007 will replace the ageing fregats of the Bremen class.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful armchair, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and certain security technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest frequencies to sail far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the endless delays in the most advanced technologies, military vessels, which are said to allow Germany to channel military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they are put into service.
The unsuccessful F125 fregata fell under the heading last year when the German navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a navy returns a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
There are little known reasons for the return, but the German press mentions a number of major defects in the software and hardware that would have caused the ship to be useless in a military mission.
The software weaknesses are particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is half the size of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that this vessel is too heavy, reducing its efficiency and limiting the ability of the navy to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
The cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also gradually becoming a problem, alongside the perishing technical equipment.
It is said that it has risen from an initial sum of EUR 2.2 billion to an amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion ($ 3.6 billion).
The latest problems affecting the frigate have become very significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is being reduced.
This year, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the navy is actually 'failing to use ships'.
The official said that the problems had arisen over time, because old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class members could join the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the highland estates in Scotland aims to reveal the use of bats in hunting food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future nature protection activities.
The researchers of National Trust for Scotland will observe in their research the bats, soprano bats, brown ears and water-eagles in the gardens of Vester Ross Inverevo.
Special recorders will be placed in certain areas of the territory to allow for monitoring the activity of bats throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile tests by hand detectors.
The analysis of all sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bat signals and the type of activity.
Then a map of residential areas and a report will be created, which will help to form a detailed image of behaviour on the whole landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes that the results will reveal which residential areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of maintenance work on residential areas, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas in order to be suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works that affect overhangs and destroy residential areas.
Windmills and lightnings are also a threat, as are catchers, some of the chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as domestic cats hunting.
The bats are actually not blind.
However, the use of ears to catch prey during night hunting is more helpful than that of the eyes.
The location of insects or obstacles in the flight path shall be accurately identified by bats by a sophisticated echolocation method.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is particularly responsible for bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland in the Threave Manor in Damfris and Galway, where eight of the ten Scottish bat species live.
Manor overseer David Thompson says that the manor area is ideal for them.
“Threave Manor has a great place for bats,” he said.
– We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so work here and elsewhere will help them to understand better what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of verifying the absence of bats before the start of maintenance work on the site, since accidental destruction of one hatchery may result in the death of up to 400 females and cubs, which may result in the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats shall be stored and they shall be prohibited from being killed, irritated or disturbed and the destruction of their hatcheries shall be prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish bat protection fund, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have to learn a lot about our bats, and we don’t know how many local species are going. ”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape – lawyers intend to bring a German magazine to court
Cristiano Ronaldo called him the charges of rape "melagians" and said that people, using his name, "are seeking to make themselves known".
His lawyers are ready to bring the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published charges, to court.
The attacker of Portuguese and Juventus clubs was accused of rape of American Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel announced that he had then allegedly paid the woman 375 000 dollars to keep the event silent.
Speaking to 142 million followers in a lively "Instagram" picture a few hours after reports of charges, Mr. Ronald criticised the reports of 33 years and called them "melagiens".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – liars – said five times “Ballon d’Or” winner looking at the camera.
- Using my name, they want to be famous.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name is part of my work.
I am a happy person, it's all right," the athletes added smilingly.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of Ch. Ronald are going to sue Der Spiegel for charges which they called "inadmissible publicity of suspicions of private space".
Judge Christian Schertz said that the sportsman will seek compensation for "moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation – perhaps one of the most serious personal offences in the last few years."
It is said that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at Palms Casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to Nevada Clark County Court, after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman's room where he allegedly raped her analogue.
K. Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on his knees and told her that there was a "99 percent good man" issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronald acknowledged that the couple had sexual intercourse, but they claimed that they were contractual.
K. Mayorga also states that she applied to the police, and her injuries in the hospital were photographed, but later she agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she "feared of countermeasures" and was worried that she would "publicly humiliate".
A 34 - year - old woman claims that she is now seeking to cancel the agreement because she still feels traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronald had gone from Manchester United to Madrid Real Club, and this summer, after signing a contract worth 100 million euros, he joined the Italian giant Juventus.
Braxitas. The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Grego Clarko, Secretary of Business, the United Kingdom would be "perpetuatingly sorry" if after Braxito it lost its global leadership in car manufacturing.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota unit in the United Kingdom to the BBC that, if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, production in the Burnaton factory near Derby would be suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the loss of death at the border would mean the loss of jobs without an agreement.
Auris and Avensis produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory," said the CEO of Toyota Burnstone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concerns about the withdrawal from the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
BMW claims, for example, that it will close its Mini plant after a month of Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying threat will arise in the supply chain Brexit without contract.
Toyota's production line operates when necessary, as custom-made cars have their parts delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK EU leaves without a treaty on 29 March, there may be problems at the border; according to this industry, this may delay or delay delivery of details.
Toyota claimed that it would not be possible to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbishiri plant and that production would stop.
According to Clark, the plan for future relations with the EU of Theresa May Chequers is "made in such a way as to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that I say would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to use this opportunity," he said for the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
"In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue using the very successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say for what time the production would stop, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaton factory and who is responsible for the United Trade Union meetings, said that his trade union members are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The government representative said: "We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, the short meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"As the fight for the candidate for the Supreme Court judges continues, a very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rhodes Rosenstein may be postponed for a week", said the White House on Sunday.
Rossenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, short-term relations with Russia and possible interference of the President with the rule of law.
The question of whether Short will forgive Deputy Prosecutor General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the carrying of a microphone for conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through Amendment 25.
Rossenstein denied this report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday with his report of resignation.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then held in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was postponed in order not to coincide with the meeting of the Senate Court Committee, where both Kavanaughas and Dr Christine Blastey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, witnessed.
On Friday, the FBI ordered that Kavanaugh's accusations be investigated within a week, thus postponing the vote again in the plenary sitting of the Senate.
A short press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox news release.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “His date is not fixed, but it may take place this week, but in view of all events relating to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report news to the press."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: from 10 September, Sanders did not hold any press conference in the White House.
The married Chris Wallaces asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences rarely take place because they don't like TV journalists who want to be "effective to viewers".
Then mentioned that Trump more often communicates directly with the press.
"The President answers questions more frequently than any previous president," she said and, without providing any evidence, she added: "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than to talk to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that this has happened many times over the last few weeks, and press conferences will be replaced by your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to the questions regularly leaves the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One person’s press conferences are rare.
The President's free and sometimes strange presentation against journalists in New York this week probably explained why.
Health Minister wrote to Scottish NST workers from the EU about the concerns of Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote a letter from the EU to Scottish NSB workers expressing her gratitude and willingness to stay under Brexit.
The Scottish Member Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for long-term resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote: "The negotiations on exit between the UK and the EU continued and are approaching the expected solutions this autumn.
But the UK Government started to prepare faster for a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees – regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the functioning of the healthcare system, benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Urgent operation by Christian Abercrombie who suffered a head injury
On Saturday at 31:27, the Vanderbilt Commodores team won an urgent operation by Christion Abercrombie, a defender of the race's head traumatized "Tennessee State Tigers", reported Michelas Organas, journalist of "Tennessee".
Chief coach of Tennessee State Rhodes Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff at the side line of Abercrombie gave a breath of oxygen, then placed on the carriers and sent them for further research.
Mr Chris Harris, the official of the state of Tennessee, from the WSMV, said that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type and extent of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Officially spent the sports season, Abercrombie moved from Illinois and played the first season in the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the match, on Saturday he took back five balls, and the total number of balls he got during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay higher stamp duty
According to the new plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty and the additional money they receive will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risks posed by the successful Corbino campaign to attract young voters
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK tax-paying persons
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to GBP 120 million per year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May announces that foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK are going to be taxed at a higher rate by means of a stamp duty and that the money they receive will be used to help the homeless.
This step is expected to reduce the risks posed by the successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters, in order to ensure more affordable housing and adapt to high-income people.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on tax-paying persons and businesses in the UK and the additional money received will be used to promote the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The additional fee – to be paid next to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for the rental of second homes or homes – may amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that this step will allow the collection of up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built real estate is purchased by non-UK residents, which results in higher prices and makes it more difficult for customers to buy the first home.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making many rich countries and especially the districts of the capital city the ghosts of cities.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks later, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but not using it, of maintaining high real estate prices, and called on May to address the shame of the British housing supply by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbynas announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the prohibition of unloading without fault.
In addition, he wants to give more power to build new houses to municipal councils.
May said: “Last year I told you that I would try to restore the British dream when I was a prime minister – every new generation must have a better life.
This means that we need to sort out our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is wrong that people who are not resident in the UK and companies established abroad can buy their homes as easily as the British people do.
For many people the dream of having a home has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team"
Jack Ross, CEO of Sunderland, says that his final goal is to ever become the leader of the Scottish national team.
At the age of 42, Scott likes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, currently located in the third place of the first league and three points behind the first place.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to "Stadium of Light" this summer.
“ As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into B's team and it's over," Ross told the BBC programme Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But as a child, I grew up at the Hamden stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish national competitions, and that always attracted me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully."
To Ross, Sunderland was led by Dickas Advocate, David Moyes, Samas Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Home Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswick Town's proposals, the former head of Alloa Athletic says that he didn't feel worried when he started working after such famous leaders in such a big club.
"Now my success will be measured by the answer to the question "Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club clearly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him there, but I'll probably just get the club back to the league to think that I've been working here successfully."
Ross's management career lasts only three years. Previously he worked as a manager assistant at the Dubarton Club and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
Later, they helped to recover to Alloa, who fell into the third division, and the St Mirren club, which was threatened with falling down, turned the next season into the winners of the championship.
Ross says that he is more satisfied than ever with his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic Clubs.
"This change was probably radical," he remembers about the leadership of "Alloa".
“I sincerely believed that it was more appropriate to lead me than to play.
This sounds strange because I was lucky, made a lot of money, and I was happy with the satisfying achievements.
But playing can be hard.
Every week you have to overcome many problems.
And now it's not easy – work stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. As an adult, I have always felt in my slugs, but leadership is most satisfying."

The studies found that the best time for beer pinta was 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of the poor British brewers, but it has made it even more difficult for the restaurant networks to bear the burden.
The figures showed that in July the sales of breweries and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants the revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business advisory company CGA, who prepared this data, said: “Incessant sunrise and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship meant that the trend continued in July, as was the case in June, when brewery income increased by 2.8 percent. True, restaurants suffered even more than before.
In June trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation got even worse.
The results of the beer and bars on the main income from the sale of beverages were undoubtedly the best, and trade in them increased more strongly than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the main revenue from the food business brewery was also affected by the sun.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-run breweries and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food sales dropped by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the leisure and productivity sector, says the company RSM: “These results continue the trend that has been evident since the end of April.
In the case of catering establishments, the main factors remain the air and the impact of major social and sporting events.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer. It is true that the fall in sales of 4.8 percent for many years will be particularly painful because it will contribute to continued cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for businesses receiving the most income from food trade. Time will show whether the milder temperature in August will provide the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in breweries and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the slow down in the development of branded networks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring tool for the UK breweries, bars and restaurants sector and its guidelines collect and analyse operational data from 47 active groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some only 11 years old, has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is being declared
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic account for their parents
One in five children, some only 11 years of age, creates secret social media accounts and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing rapidly, making reference to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is being declared
Twenty percent of the students said they were using a censored basic account for their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally found a secret 13-year-old daughter's website found out that her teen girl insisted on saying, "Reject me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, and half of these students have been classified as hidden.
The head of the MDK, Mikeius Buchanan, said: "The fact that so many teenagers give in to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying."
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant at the general annual meeting of the Management Body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish lighter and chairman. Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity to make use of the various international experience she has gained over the past decade.
"Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Council will bring significant benefits to Scottish sport," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I will make a real contribution and help lead sports in Scotland. ”

Advertising of breast milk, which compares mothers to cows, has received different assessments on the Internet
The company producing breast milk attracts different views on its advertising, which compares feeding mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark the beginning of trade in a product described as the world's first silent portable breasts, the consumer technology company Elvie has released an inspired advertising of an ironic music video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom that the new milking mothers enjoy.
Four true mothers dance in the side-car, according to the sound recording, for example: "Yes, I'm lying to myself, but no tail can see" and "If you didn't notice, here is not the body, here is my breasts."
The appendix continues: "Extract him, pull him out, feed him to the babies, pull him out, pull him out, milk my beautiful."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The video reviewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments was answered in various ways by the viewers, and many said that it looked at the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their newborn babies are taken away from them after a few days," one woman wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk invisibly fit in the feeding bra ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It’s a surprise that it hurts both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for advertising that presents breast milk for mothers who do not take their babies away?"
Another added: "Advertisement is a total misunderstanding."
The other commentator defended the advertising – one woman admitted that she had a song "very fun".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy it if I'd still feed.
When I got off my milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertising is for mothers who withdraw their milk (often in workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that all shocks with unseen pelts in their bras.
The campaign’s idea is based on the perception that many women who stop breast milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk drawer doesn't make any sound, has no wires or pipes, and has an unobservable room in the feeding bra, which allows women to move their milk freely, keep babies or even leave their homes.
Mother's partner and executive director Anna Balarin commented: Elvie's milk draw is a revolutionary product that deserves to be sold boldly and provocatively.
When we compared the women who feed with the dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the fact that the milk is being cut off and to all the challenges it poses, while also showing, with joy and as much as possible, the incredible sense of freedom that the new dairy draws.
Elvie's milking came to the press headlines not for the first time.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski's mother demonstrated her two children on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp at the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially during the month, but there has been a significant increase in the number of children detained, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that they were at risk of staying in the country when they applied for child custody.
When the federal authorities announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, the Chief Executive of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, testified to Congress that the institution had arrested several dozens of people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not previously tried.
“Almost 80 percent of these people live illegally in the country as guardians or as members of their families, most of whom are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these people", said Albence.
According to the shelter workers, in order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which require some children to appear in court within a month of detention rather than within 60 days, as was the case before.
Many people will try to defend their application for legal status against a judge on immigration issues not when they come personally, but through a conference video call.
Those who are recognised as not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely it is that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to episodes of violence or attempts to escape.
Defenders claim that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as the Tornilles shelter, where the size increases the likelihood of losing sight of signs of child suffering.
They added that moving children to the tent town could deepen many of the injuries that had already been suffered by them by not giving them sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or by saying goodbye to their friends.
Syria told U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walidas al-Moualem, invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been taking place for eight years.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces under the pretext of the fight against terrorism on Syrian land are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this holy struggle until we have eradicated both terrorist groups and any irregular aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are some 2 000 United States troops in Syria who are training and advising the Kurd forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1 000 land soldiers in a war-destructed country.
As far as the refugee problem is concerned, Moualem said that conditions for their return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fears that deter refugees from returning.
"We have applied to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large insurgent fortress in Idlib has created the conditions for more rapid progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-led Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines, and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, expects to convene soon the first meetings of a committee composed of the Government and members of the opposition to prepare the draft post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem has set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the Committee: the work of the Group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and has warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for the second term?
On the basis of this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, his presidency would be prematurely ended with impeachment and scandal.
Of course, this would be the most dramatic end of the Presidency ever!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue among viewers.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time ratings in CNN TV have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC to almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of best broadcasting time, whose number has grown from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC is the first player in cable TV ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” says Neal Barrer, who produces the ABC series Descedent about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the attack of the Congress House.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Only funny parts and a few unpleasant truths, how to secretly enter the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote in favour of the Short.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He's making me laugh," he said to Scovell.
Chaos is valuable because he's having fun.
Of course, unlike other shows shown on television, the stories coming from Washington may determine the future of Roe v Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
Failure to watch is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's more than necessary to be informed to the citizen when you realize that you've been watching a group of experts for six hours now, discussing how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his "Treasure" book, Paul Manafort is showing a $15,000 B.C. article "The Washington Post" and what is meant by the shocking description of Stormy Daniels' Short Anatomy.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions resemble a reality show, because every night he throws you something," says the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" Brent Montgomery.
You can't miss any series, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of heat and sunlight outside his house on the bank of the North Caucasus, but he was in the room and, by recording CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not rest – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had a station against the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
"I remember when we used to make these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization",  says Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from around is pouring into the tense fight of the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is no wonder that the conversion of the Congress Districts, which ended with the attempt of two Members of the House of Representatives to win the same post, has resulted in money in the 17th District of Pennsylvania.
The recently redesigned suburb of Pittsberg involved the Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamba in the fight, who won his seat in a special election in another district last spring.
The Lamb competes with another Member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the previous district 12 of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps to reconstruct when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that, in violation of the Constitution, the old counties were falsified for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the election fight in the new district of 17, the main parties' financial institutions – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRK) – were hit by the campaign's finances.
Lamb was famous in Pennsylvania when a small majority in the 18th Congress District won the widely held special elections held in March.
For more than a decade, the Republicans took this place, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political experts gave the Democrats some kind of advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but then calmed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, but in principle they did not have a negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela, and until partners moved the management of the Tromp Organization, he had a hotel in the country.
“The recent decisions of the officials of the Taiwanese State Department decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” said the representative of the Department Heather Nauert earlier this month.
However, sanctions are only considered for El Salvador, which received some USD 140 million of American assistance in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions for individuals, would have been painful for a high-level Central American country with unemployment and murders.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an important step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the highest administrative officials clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus largely concluded any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to demonstrate the importance of the administration for this assembly, Vice-President Michel Pence has now been added to the list of speakers for the conference planned for the middle of October,” diplomats said.
And three American envoys silently returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any reprimand or punishment from Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, about which three American officials, including two diplomats, had agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
It is inevitable to wait for a report by special adviser Robert Mueller on a possible short disruption to justice – very strong evidence of him is now available in public archives.
Moreover, as it is said, Mueller asks his investigation whether the Short Campaign has not been conducted in secret cooperation with Russia, which has harmed our elections.
If Congress were to move to other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time, when he is going to come back against voters and perhaps finally against the Commission of Officers.
Here is a great deal of "if" and I do not say that the end of the short term is inevitable – just like its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938 German officials were ready to demolish Hitler – it was only necessary for the West to oppose him and support Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We screwed up and missed an opportunity to prevent the slaughterings that took several years later.
History lies around such fundamental turning points – then the unscrupulous march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Now the Americans have reached some of these crucial turning points.
What if Trump dismisses Deputy Prosecutor General Rhodes Rosenstein, the person on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
Rossenstein’s difficulties began when the newspaper reported that last year the official suggested that he secretly record the president and consider his unfitness to perform his duties.
Rossenstein says that The Times' story is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation conducted by the FBI by Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite convincing accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
Finally, will we vote in favour of Congress in the mid-term elections, which will force Short to assume responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is threatened with a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Jewish of Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once located in the home where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later I was sent to light the Sabbath candles on a table with swastic.
When I have such an inheritance, how can I look at our future in a neo-optimistic way?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers' reunion with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistic
Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive on Thursday knowing that if it were possible to win an impressive competition with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month against the Austrians, it could be in a strong position to leave the G Group.
Because of the road trauma the middle player Graham Dorrans this season was able to show up for the first time only 2:2 in the final competition with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers Club can use this result as a trampling for more important goals.
"This was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a great team," said 31-year-old player.
“We started playing in the belief that we will achieve something, and we have finished with something.
Perhaps we could have been more ambitious at the end, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They must've played the first heap better, and we've stretched the second and showed us who we're the better team.
Thursday will be another important evening of the European League.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough, because in the last competition they have been a great result, but I have no doubt that with the support of the viewers we can take a step forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the workouts are great.
I hope that we will now be able to take a step forward, forget last season and play successfully."
This fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Although the questioners had a clear picture of the concern they wanted to have, few spoke to family members about this.
About half of the nationwide survey respondents said that they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide life insurance company.
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you do not advance your wishes, you will not prepare your family to care for you.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and what kind of care you would like to receive, since these factors can be important to predict costs.
Invite a financial adviser, who can also help you to figure out a way to pay these costs.
For long-term care, you can decide to pay these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed life assurance scheme or your assets as long as you have the money.
Develop legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by allowing documents to be protected.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Furthermore, consider the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you become inefficient.
Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and that he or she is taken to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be ready, list these details in the plan.
“It’s not just financial issues that matter. Who are doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracum
After spending the evening in town, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
In his chest, in his belly, and in his hand forty years, the victim was shot in the district of Ilfracum Oxford Grauv, in Devon.
About 02.30 a.m., officers described the shootings carried out during the summer of England as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not threaten his life, and the police are asking for the help of witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
“At least 384 were killed when the Indonesian city of Palu was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on Friday,” the officials say.
Due to the destruction of communications, officials were not able to obtain any data from the residence of the Danube, north of the Palu area close to the 7.5-point earthquake epicentre.
In the event of a disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulaves.
In 2017, Palu, which had about 379 800 inhabitants, is the capital of the central province of Sulavesi, established at the end of a narrow western bay on the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake hit tsunamis.
The Danube is a rennet that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulavesi.
In 2017, approximately 299 200 inhabitants lived in Regenty – a smaller administrative region than the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulavesi, in particular the coastal region of the Danube.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, however, mainly concentrated on Morovale on the other side of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times in the last century from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in the Danube and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, the tsunami hit western Dongal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is located on the seismically active Pacific fire ring, is constantly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh Indonesia caused a tsunami in the north of Sumatra, affecting 14 countries and killing 226 000 people along the Indian coast – more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and early April 2005, several severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed near Nias Island.
In 2006, the 6.8-point earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-point earthquake rocked the area near the Western Province of Sumatra, Tyre.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5-point earthquake hit one of the islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres, killing dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, due to a mild earthquake in Aceh, the renown of Pidiya Jaya was destroyed and panicd, as people remembered how everything was destroyed after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes hit the richly visited island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is arrested for indictment of domestic violence
Indictment led to arrest of Track Palin, the son of the chief governor of former Alaska and candidate for Vice President Saraha Palin.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police, 29-year-old Palin of Vasila (Aliaska) was arrested with suspicion of domestic violence, interference with the reporting of domestic violence and resistance to detention.
According to a police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palin was released for pre-trial detention at Mat-With Pre-trial Detention and released for a $500 deposit.
“On Saturday he appeared in court, where he was asked to justify himself, he said he was completely innocent,” the network reported.
Palin is accused of three class A offences, which means that a fine of USD 250 000 may be imprisoned and punished for up to one year.
He's also accused of B-class abuse, he's a fine day in prison and he's a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
Date of UN designation: 1 January 2016.
His girl said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from the Veterans' groups, which linked his son's cruel treatment to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died Friday after the tsunami on the island of Sulavesi Indonesia.
7.5 The earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near Central Sulaves, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
In social media, video recordings are shared that show the tsunami’s moment of impact.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people gathered to the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors in New York's terrorist attack suspect rarely seek capital punishment
In New York City, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been committed in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on 31 October, 30-year-old Saipov rented a truck from Home Depot and arranged an attack on the bicycle trail along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – driving along the path, placing pedestrians and cyclists.
As reported in a report on the intention to seek the death penalty in the South of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious personal injury.
According to the court document, both of these points of charge can lead to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal great jury announced to Saipov the indictment of 22 points, including eight charges of extortion of property (usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases) and the accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claim that the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and that the way Saipov executed it was called disgusting, cruel and immoral.
“The actions of Sayfull Habibullaevicius Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss of family members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnano Pagnucci,” states the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade ago, the last case requiring a death penalty in the South District of New York was dealt with.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time, the death penalty was executed in 1953 in the New York federal case against the spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenberg, who were sentenced two years ago to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accused act, Saipov revealed to the officials that he was inspired by the Islamic State (ISIS) videos he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital room to hang an Islamic flag.
He did not admit his fault according to 22 points of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders representing Saipov, said that they were obviously disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not to admit guilt and imprisonment to life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the injury of these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to reach the death penalty.
The Tori Parliamenter says that NIGELAS FARAGE has to be responsible for the Braxit negotiations
Today, at the Torror Conference, Nigel Farageć promised to mobilise the nation's army.
A former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of the parliamentarians of the Theresa May party suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boneñas, a member of the Conservative Chamber of Communities, told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would now have left if the Secretary of Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite divided ranks of supporters were revealed by the tors in favour of staying in the EU who joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement her compromise plan agreed in Chekers when it is attacked by Braxit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bonne, through Leave Means Leave, Solihalle said he wanted to ruin the Chekers plan.
He said that Farage was to be an equal partner and had to be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led, we would have left the EU already," he said.
He added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chekers Plan'.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we did not fight to obey others.
In our own country we want to make our own laws."
“The belief that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false” said Bone.
The supporter of Brexit, Thor Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the demonstrations and told journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, hear the people.
The Czechs' plan is not popular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it; it is also unpopular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, above all, vote for us.
Abandon the Chekers Plan and start listening."
In her critical report, May added: "The Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage, he said, must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a referendum decision in 2016.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, the nation and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to extradite Brexit, so today we're here to tell them that we're not going to let them get away with it."
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to force our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, to feel hot.
We are mobilising this nation's army, which has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And the opponents of Brexit marched up Birmingham streets before holding a two-hour rendezvous in the city centre.
As the group formed this weekend, a group of activists waved with posters "Toriai v "Brexit".
Legiborist Lord Adoni suffocated the Conservative about the security problems they experienced as a result of the party app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the option Canada plus, without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in the presidential elections
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential elections after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future at a meeting with the public on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who regularly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections, which will meet with GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Short Campaign in Massachusetts.
It was predicted that it could negotiate with the Short Year 2020.
Since Trump became President, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok was her 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and women must lead it.
Detained suspect in LSU Simso shooting case
The police of Louisiana Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that they had detained a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Waydeł Sims on Friday.
At a press conference held at 11:00, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained.
The police distributed a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man there.
20 - year - old Sims was shot and died early on Friday, near the town of South University.
According to 247sports, police commander Murphy J. Paul announced to the media on Saturday that Wayde, Sims, was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Waydeius stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, had a gun, and shot at Waydés Sims.
Symposium was not arrested and was closed to arrest by the East Baton Ruž District Police Department.
The 198-cm-old pre-last year student Sims grew up in Baton Ruže, in the last season he played 32 games, 10 of which started in five, spent 17.4 minutes on the ground, earning 5,6 points and winning a 2,9 ball.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came to the title of the world champion when the team directed him to give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott overcame Lewis Hamilton on Saturday's qualification drive, it became clear immediately that Mercedes's team's instructions in the race will be very important.
When he started his race from the first place, Bott started his race perfectly and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left him in the trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn into a two-way garage, left Hamilton and he returned to the race in the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
Mercedes turned into a two-way garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind the Vettel, but after the actions that had not been completed by the contact, Hamilton ran forward when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre, was reluctant to free up the inner side of the track in order to keep his position in the third turn.
On 21th birthday, Max Verstappen started from the end of the roll, but at the end of the first wheel he was already on his seventh drive.
He was the fastest part of the race, because he was driving without changing tires to be as fast as possible in the finish, to bypass Kimi Raikkonen and finish the fourth.
Finally, in the 44th wheel he entered the garage of two partitions, but the remaining eight wheels were unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line by a fourth.
“ It was a difficult day for Valtter because he had a good weekend, and when he was asked to spend, he acted like a gentleman.
The team worked perfectly and won the first two places," he said.
That was really bad body language
President Donald Trump scorned Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting with people on Saturday because this persistently denies Christine Blastey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of sexual rape.
In his speech in Western Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, obscene and unjust.
"What could have happened and actually happens in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see that people are wicked, wicked, unclean and unjust," he said.
“ When you see official statements and discharges, then you say: “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document?
Not at all.
I didn't get married."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we did not drain," he added, visualizing the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I did not marry her story."
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I did it as she asked."
However, it seems that the president did not agree with her when he met with people on Saturday evening: “You know, this was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't leak, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend the candidate for Supreme Court judges accused by three women of illegal sexual conduct, the President said that the democrats used the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any appropriate means.
You see grossness, uncleanness; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to cross to gain power and control", - quoted the President's speech "Mediaite".
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two prizes in the match with the Dandi Club "Giants"
"Dundee Stars" took advantage of the defeat of Belfast Giants on Friday Elite and won Saturday's response game Dandi's score 5:3.
“Giants” got ahead early when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer earned two goals.
Mikeło Sullivan and Jordan Cowenie's result was a positive one before Dwyer took the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of Dandi’s team evened out the result, but later two of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen’s goals brought victory.
Adam Keefe, the men of Adam Keefe, experienced the third defeat this season in the Elite League, before Friday night in Belfast and won the Dandi Club score 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, and the previous three match winners were Giants.
Dwyer beat the first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after the transfer of Kendallo McFull, and four more minutes later, Beauviller doubled after the transfer of David Rutherford.
At the hard-start matches Sullivan returned the arena hosts to the game earning a goal of 13:10, and after the transfer of Matt Marquardto, Cownies adjusted the result 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants went out for the first break at the top, and he got his second goal at the end of the first podium.
Having a quantitative balance, the square hosts regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the result at 27:37.
Cowanie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to assist Nielsen in the first game of Dandi's team to beat forward at the end of the second helm, and established the victory by winning the fifth helm in the middle of the last helm.
Giants, who have already lost four final matches out of five, will meet Milton Keynes team at home the next Friday.
The air traffic controller died to help hundreds of aircraft passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he died helping an aircraft with several hundred passengers safely to take off to the air.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were found missing after a severe earthquake on the island of Sulaves on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
The area continues to be shaken by severe repeated earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained at his workplace to help the 6321 aircraft of Batik Air, which was already on the take-off runway, to fly safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was falling, he jumped out of it.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Australia’s ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, an Indonesian air navigation representative, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We took him on a helicopter from Balykpapan, in Kalimantan, to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is an extremely painful message for us," he added.
On the other hand, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands, as the national disaster reduction agency reports that cities of Heaven, Siggio and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to increase as many victims are still under the ruins and we cannot reach them", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] high, the city of Palu will be destroyed; it will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, said: “Each minute, high - speed cars bring the victims.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere."
Janis Gelfand CNN, leader of the international Indonesian Red Cross, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
James Widod, President of Indonesia, came to Palau on Sunday and asked the country’s army: “Please all of you work day and night to carry out all your evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombook, where more than 550 people died.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Newgini now states that once the plane falls into the lagoon one person has disappeared
The airlines that carried out the flight, which ended the plane crash on the Pacific Lagoon of Micronesia, now say that one person is missing, although previously they said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking plane.
In the report Air Newgini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of one passenger's husband.
The airlines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their search for a man.
The airlines have not responded immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crews when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuk.
The officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear why the accident occurred and what was the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane fell from a very low point of view.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynez told us that he and others were able to get to emergency exits in a sinking plane that was flooded to his waist.
He said that the flight satellites were covered by panic and shouted, while he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that their sailors, who repaired the quay nearby, also helped rescue people who had been taken to the shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane dragged to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the aviation safety network, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades by aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them owned Air Newgini.
Analyst set out a sequence of events during the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office presented the facts in the repeated case of a man who was accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the area of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury the use of cell phone records to unite the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telllis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on her death night, which contradicted previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not present in his city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellie was telling the truth, saying that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he “wronged because his truck was in Nashville. ”
Another coincidence was that Telli said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers Tellis deleted Chambers messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has taken her out of his life," said Hale.
It is envisaged that the defence will start to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge argued that the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The Hiphop Trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading his music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the origins of the hip hop and again popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Futures and Common have recently reborn in UK works by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A new York babysitter brought a couple to court after they had been dismissed because of a "racist" message
A New York babysitter brought a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a message sent at the wrong address from a mother complaining that she was "one more black".
The couple denies the existence of racists and called the claim "violence".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman is saddened to learn that the new child care provider Giselle Maurice is black when she arrived on the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEAE, YOUR JUST," Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to his husband.
However, she was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized that she had acted unwittingly, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and dismissed Mr. Maurice, saying that the former nurse, who was an African American, had failed to do her job and had hoped to see a Filipino instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by Uber car.
Maurice has now brought a couple to court to claim compensation for dismissal and is trying to order as much as USD 350 a day for half a year's life and work at the customer's home, for which it was initially hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday at Post, adding: "I know this is discrimination".
The couple turned their backs on the charges of racism by denying it and claimed that it was reasonable to dismiss Mauritius because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the man Joel Plasz.
“ Would you trust your children to someone who was rude, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so."
Plasz, who compared the claim to "violation", said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge for this?
This is not very nice behaviour", – added investment banking specialist.
While the court proceedings were under way, the media were shocked to condemn a couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers fear that readers will not understand the speaking bear
Karen Jankel, a daughter of Bondo, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to feel another place to read the book for the first time before it is released.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book to children about the crust bear, would not be too upset if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th year of the release of the book after the father's death was kind and sad together.
Speaking about Paddington, which she described as “a very important member of the family”, she added that his father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a rather calm person and didn't like to be drunk," she said.
“Since Paddington was so similar to him, he felt like having a child who achieved something: he was proud of him, although it is not really your job.
I think he valued the success story of Paddington in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
When her daughter landed, she was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteuro 2, where doctors were not able to save her life.
“Nada constantly called and said that the condition was really bad, it is not expected to survive,” said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“At that time I received a call from Nad, who called to tell her that she had two minutes to live, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, my dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicines given by your doctor that kept your heart beat slowly stopped working and left your body.
She died a little earlier and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I couldn't fight, cry, or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I should've kept it in myself."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, who is now mourning his deceased daughter, got on board with other passengers who do not understand the difficult test she needs to face.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was lowered, and my tears were all the time.
It is difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's Suffocating Postcards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wales Bridge distribute cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Mr. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want one father to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, who lives on board, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They would always say that his smile lights the room."
But he quit work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Mr Davis said: "I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur."
Mr Davis created the cards “so that people know that there are people around you who can contact and talk, even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Humphreys, a long-time friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed and complained to anyone," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
The situation was completely bad at Christmas: when the children rolled out their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye and did not react."
She said that his death was a huge injury to them, but they must overcome it: “In the family it left empty.
It's ruining our heart.
But we must all live and fight."

The future of Bretto Kavanaugh remained on the hair at the start of the investigation by the FBI
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a study of limited duration and scope – maybe we would bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee "is" in the strong grips of supporters.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their opposition is determined by time alone.
Before the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks remain and, if the Republicans are expected to turn out to be poor, their efforts to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can obtain 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate relations and confirm them to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean deserts "reduced"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserts to South Korea fell when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, said last year there were 1 127 desserts, compared to 2 706 desserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were strengthened border controls between North Korea and China and increased smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not provide any public comments.
Many North Korean deserts are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China sees the deserts as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced them back to their homeland.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically fighting, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang at the heart of the negotiations on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when both agreed essentially to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of keeping their sanctions unchanged since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm the first," said Mr. Ri.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh calls him "sterical" and claims that he is not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Chamber of Representatives, described the candidate for the Supreme Court judges Bretta Kavanaugh as "sterical" and said that he was not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr Pelosi made these comments during an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't just think that if a woman did this, she would be told that she was hysterical," Mr Pelosi expressed his reaction to the evidence given by Mr Kavanaugh to the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had committed sexual violence against Dr Christine Blastey Ford, both of whom were still teenagers.
In his introductory speech, when he spoke about the family and the times of high school, Mr Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he did not begin to cry or cry.
He also totally condemned the former Democrats in the Committee, who accused him of "the grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his bias towards the democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by his statements and the attack of the Clinton and Democratic Party," she said.
When asked whether he would seek to exclude Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy had been approved and the Democrats had received a majority of the votes in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
"I will say this – if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, it is not appropriate to perform his duties not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Mr Pelosi.
He is currently a judge of the District Appeal Court of Colombia.
Ms Pelosi added that she was concerned, as a democracy, about the possible decisions of Ms Kavanaugh concerning the Act on Access to Health or in the Roe v Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
"Now is not the time to say hysterically, biased personality: "How wonderful!" – said N. Pelosi.
The power that women should exercise
This is a legitimate criticism – finally, the outburst of months and even years of anger, which she cannot say without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, does it seem to you?"
She went on to say: “I was very much helped by a woman head of a company who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a certain method: when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to at the time: ‘ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
It seemed brilliant to me."
The tears are considered to be an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most outstanding memories is one of the first works in the office, where most men worked, and where I once started crying for irresistible anger.
“Never let them see you crying,” said me.
- They don't know you're insane.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
A member of the Congress of the Democratic Party from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with the Gary Charter during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Kharto was caught by a stranger on board the Monkey Business (aphorism of light time) and withdrawn his candidacy, Mr Schroeder felt deeply disappointed that there was no reason why he could not stand for President himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
- There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Sneedle with seven thumbs."
When the campaign started late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore not to announce a candidate until she collects $2 million.
It was an uneven fight.
She noticed that some of the donors who donated $1,000 to men were only allocating 250 dollars to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave her speech that she announced that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported it, a disappointment system that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger about sexism – that she wept.
“You would have thought I had a nervous problem,” recalled Mr Schroeder’s press response to her speech.
- You'd think I'm supported by the Cleanex tissue business.
I remember thinking what's going to be written in my tomb monument.
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade generation can benefit Beijing
The first salvages in the U.S. and China’s trade war have been fueled, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say that the conflict could eventually be of benefit to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump gave his first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The greatest resistance took place this week, when new tariffs came into force, affecting goods worth USD 200 billion ($150 billion), i.e., in principle, half of Chinese exports to the US.
Beijing replied to all the measures in the same way: the latest decision imposed a duty of between five and ten per cent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars in total.
China has sworn to fight the US teeth for the tooth, and it seems that this second world market is not going to land in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only be relaxed if China complied with the requirements, but publicly bowing the US would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its part properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the United States could eventually have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic disruptions in both countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than the observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute "Asia New American Security Center".
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is ready to receive return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by the war of more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walidas al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The progress in the fight against terrorism has made the situation in the territory much more stable and secure," he said.
The government continues its efforts to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore normal conditions.
All conditions have already been put in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and prosperity.
The UN estimates that around 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, it was also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which won the final result of the U.S. team 16,5:10,5, won the "Le Golf National" Cup in 2018 at the "Le Golf National" Square near Paris (France).
For the sixth time in a row, the USA has lost in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe has recovered its crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn collected 14,5 points that were enough to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was hard to do throughout the tournament, let go of the ground straight to the water with the 16th hole in the match against Francesco Molinari for 3 days.
The Italian player F. Molinari has competed in all rounds and has become one of the four players who achieved a score of 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained the current form.
The American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was won by the lowest-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustine Johnson 2:1, the world's top ranking player, lost English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Veteran Spaniard Sergio Garcia from the eight "Ryder" Cup tournaments became the most successful European player ever in this tournament, collecting 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I could help," said S. Garcia after the victory of Europeans.
He sends an estafe to his compatriot John Ram, who hit the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday Unit Game 2:1.
“I am incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his match in France and now he owns 13-21-3 "Ryder" Cup career record.
These are strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 biggest prizes and landed only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the driving lawn all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing team show: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a moment when we began to put pressure on Europeans.
We fought.
I'm heading for Thomas's hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I can be their captain.
There's a bow down your head.
Our opponents were superior."
