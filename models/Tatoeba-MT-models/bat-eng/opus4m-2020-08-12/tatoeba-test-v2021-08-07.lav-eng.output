When an English speaker notices that a foreigner he speaks to does not understand something he says, he repeats exactly the same thing, but louder, as if he were deaf. At no point does he come to mind that choosing his words might be complicated, or that his expression could be easily understood by a foreigner, and that he could say it in other words. As a result, a person not only still does not understand what he said, but also becomes irritated about being considered deaf.
