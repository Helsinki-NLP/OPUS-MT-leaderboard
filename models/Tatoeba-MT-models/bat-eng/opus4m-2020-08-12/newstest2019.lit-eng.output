All accused persons: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšis, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurianskis gathered to the 11th hearing of MG Baltic case on Monday.
The hearing began with evidence from the accused.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the new lawyer appointed by the State to the court of Š. Gustainis, told the judicial panel of judges before he was able to get acquainted with the case file.
Then MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevicius stated that in order to ensure the full defence of a person, the judicial panel must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the case-file and asked to postpone the hearing.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to criminal case-files.
It is not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevicius.
The new lawyer A. Doroshev noted that he had not been able to get acquainted with the indictment or with all the case-file.
At the previous hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustainis, informed him that he had refused his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Sound recordings were also heard during the meeting.
The accused lawyers were angry that the sound recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, when taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated group-friendly decisions in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on decision-making of public procurement winners, reminds ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, of whom more than 50 members of the previous Seimas and this term of office, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament were interviewed.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches have been carried out.
It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received more than 8 thousand euros of bribe, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapsys - more than 27 thousand euros of bribe. E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros of bribe.
Labour party suspected of bribery and trade impact, Liberals Movement - bribery, trade of influence and abuse, and MG Baltic suspected of influence of bribery and trade of these parties.
Politicians are suspected to have consulted R. Kurianski, Vice President of MG Baltic and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the Group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics Guards: Liberals Movement Board on Vilnius Department's action right
"The decisions taken by the Board comply with the articles of association," Vytautas Tamošiūnas, the head of the BNS reported after the meeting of the Commission.
"Our solution wasn't something new.
The explanation as to how we had already been done by the Commission in July, when the question of the Pagėgiai and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, by virtue of the statute, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the board decides that a department can behave as it wishes - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all the departments will form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberals Movement of the Party repealed the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the list of newly elected election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statute of the party and decisions of the board.
By 31 October the Vilnius branch had to cancel its wish to participate in municipal elections with the list of committees.
But the department didn't do it.
Former Head of Unit Parliamentary Member Aušrinė Armonaitė has already left the Liberals Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former Chairman of the Liberals Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to seek another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Election Committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!"
He left the lot too.
Election of municipal councils and mayors will take place next March.
The villagers in northern India took a tiger on a tractor, which previously broke a man, and the officials reported on Monday.
The forest supervision officer, Mahavir Kaugelagi, said that the tigers had trembled a man working on the fields late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, while the woman tried to escape, took her by a tractor.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and insured a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Lakhympur Kheri District, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, about 250 km southeast of the capital of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
Prohibiting tigers in protected areas shall be prohibited.
The Director of the Reserve, Ramesh Pandey, said that under the Wildlife Act, the case will be reported to the police.
In April, in the area of Nighasan, Utar Pradesh, the villagers beat another tiger and suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is a national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Law, the tigers are considered to be a endangered species.
Last year’s government data show that at least one person died every day during the previous three years in a collision with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been gradually increasing since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established reserves in national parks, and the fear of the big cats began to be considered a crime.
Although the methods for calculating tigers have changed, the censuses would indicate that the then population of about 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
The mandatory labelling of cats and dogs by microchips is proposed.
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other Members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, where it is proposed that cats and dogs must be marked with subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 – also cats will be marked, therefore citizens will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of pet animals.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal producers or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that the expected average cost of providing a microchip and a service of around EUR 5 will be compensated for by all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling of pet animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be distributed over three years and to reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is planned that the funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the special programme of municipal environmental protection support, the income of which will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and reallocation of funds.
These funds will be available to municipalities not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeika, compulsory marking practices are common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because lost ones can easily be returned to owners) and saves the time for the keepers themselves, when the search for a runaway and lost pet requires a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care for the animal throughout its life.
The earlier mandatory labelling proposals were opposed, as the programmes concerned were proposed for funding from the population.
"The model now presented should avoid this criticism, because it is proposed to finance animal protection with increased income in the environmental protection support programme and the right to label not only veterinary doctors, but also public figures, i.e. persons from animal care establishments who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by the group of Seimas Members representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andriks, Antonas Vinkus and others.
13 members of the government were killed in the Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Ariff Noori, a representative of the Provincial Governor, indicated that seven soldiers and six police officers had died.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack on the joint military and police control post in the Chogian district.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed during the three-hour battle with Afghan forces and another ten Talibans were injured.
The Taliban press release, Zabihullah Mujahid, has distributed to the media a statement in which the movement assumes responsibility for the Monday attack in Ghazni Province.
Mr Noori said that this post was built two days ago in a strategically important area in order to cut off the supply route for the Taliban.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Earth" stretched out the help hand for the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the FIBA European Cup's fourth round competition will take place in Vilnius "Morning" Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
A duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which maintains warm relations with the Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina KB Pristina teams on 7th November under its roof in the Ryto Arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to organize this match in the house, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," Commander Max Michelson of the Ukrainian crew thanked "Morning".
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball countries in the world, so we will have the real honor to play here.
We expect support from the Vilnius people.
The Kosovo team was unable to come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
At present, Ukraine's team takes third place after the first wheel with one victory at three meetings, while Kosovo's team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a particularly important contact point for Group E, as only two crews will enter the next stage.
In the past, Ukraine and Kosovo team matches were also held in Vilnius for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the 100:61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
On Wednesday basketball fans will be able to get to the match free of charge, and the start of the duel – at 7 p.m.
"Women lying better" star actress B. Arsobaitis is persecuted by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė is already getting roles related to liars for a few times.
At first, the series "Women lying better", then the performance "Meals" and, finally, the comedy "Meals".
In this film, Brigitt plays an eloquent wife of Dainius Kazlauskas' hero.
"I loved filming in the "Melangers" because I'm more a theatre actress and I'm rarely seen in cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the ground was the puppy Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I've never admired those little, decorative "fife" quadrups.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I wanted to buy it from my host but failed," the actress smiled.
From the first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" that was produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "In addition to our boys..." producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas is entering the comical and intriguing perimeters of family members.
Your lover just announced she's waiting.
It would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't tell everyone about the good news, your parents suddenly say they're different!
After 50 years together...
And it all takes place just before the most beautiful celebration of the year - Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, for no one expected such atomic axes.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaite's comedy "Melagi" good mood will be presented to the audience by four-fold film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The "Meals" comedy - in the Chinese since November 9.
Deciding whether EUR 100 million of unpaid tax for emigrants has been written off
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Residence Declaration Law prepared by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the leader of "states".
56 Seimas Members voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas shall proceed to the consideration of amendments on or after 6 December upon the receipt of the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, over three years, one person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000.
Social Democratic Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way, the Seimas would 'proclaim some people not to comply with their obligations' - declared departure and then no taxes would be levied.
The Conservative member of the Committee on Health noted that Lithuanians living abroad are taking advantage of the fact that by paying a small health insurance tax they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are given the same services as those paying this tax to residents.
The amendments provide that those who have left Lithuania would be considered to be those who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The director of "Sodra" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of emigrated people and the activities of "Sodra".
A video on the Internet about a sliding bear reveals a serious problem
It is filtered out how a mother bear climbs on a steep snowy slope, while the baby climbs, slips, and relentlessly climbs.
The video received numerous reviews and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed back to his mother.
He does not succeed at the first time, but he does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
Indeed, the video was of interest, but it also reveals the human threat to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm obviously afraid of a bear drone.
Their movements show that they panic.
If there were no drones around them, they would probably have chosen a safer route or overcome it more slowly or carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said ecologist Mark Ditmer to the publication The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, along with his colleagues, studied how drones affect the bear.
The animals were equipped with heart instruments.
When the drone came near, some bears ran away, and others did not run anywhere, but all their hearts began to beat more often.
Scientists recommend that drones be used responsibly to film animals, not to fly too close, not to raise noise, and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The escaped president was addressed through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the court of Kiev invited the deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, who left Russia, to attend the hearing on the alleged betrayal of his state in an unusual manner - the summons were published in the Official Journal.
In a court call published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoj kurjer", the former leader is invited to attend a meeting of criminal proceedings to be held on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates that Mr Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court announced that it had completed the debate in the Yanukovych case.
Alexander Gorošinskis, a Russian attorney-at-law, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers until November 19, so that he could attend a meeting where V. Yanukovych would be expected to speak his last word by video.
With the support of the Kremlin, Mr Yanukovych was demolished and fled to Russia during the Maydan Uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula, and a little later there was war between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the battles have resulted in about 10,000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.

Restrictions on Cogenerative Power Plants Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CJ) against the decision of the ruling to adopt a law on the possibility to suspend construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that the group of Seimas members had applied to the KT asking to investigate compliance of the governing amendments to the Waste Management Law with the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning existing waste incineration plant projects, by entrusting the Government with the establishment of new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," says the report.
"Parliaments note that in view of the fact that the law defines a prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of "residential territory" is defined), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the established criteria have been formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of Lithuanian residents in the country, it would be practically impossible to construct such objects throughout the territory of the country", - adds.
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CJ has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and effects which arose before the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the government is empowered to apply the law retroactively according to an undefined criterion.
The establishment of such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security and protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law," - states the appeal.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in Vilnius and Kaunas CHP projects.
The suspension of the current projects would not only result in 100 million financial losses, huge losses and Lithuania's population, but also increase heating prices and increase environmental pollution due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the KT was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberals Movement, Social Democratic Groups and Deputy Senior of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė, which provide for the right of the Government to suspend the construction of cogenerative power plants already in operation, as well as to establish a 20 km "quarantine" zone for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas shall enter into force from 1 January 2019.
It is planned to consider this proposal during the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the Government's right to suspend projects already started is not planned to be abandoned.
The CJ will deal with this case in order of order at least one year later.
Presenting questions at LeBron James' statistics at Lakers' Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career in the Los Angeles Lakers Club is not as expected by him, organisation and basketball fans.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start has led to rumors for the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, the president of the basketball operations, Magic Johnson, calmed down such talks, stating that he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The biggest team star, L. James, should also turn to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 for the recovered ball and 7.7 for the effective transmission.
But she does not tell the truth.

V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in man's virginity and law enforcement
"For me, this was the most unbelieving thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are carrying out the work they are required to perform.
Everyone is doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action by him should be taken," said V.Ačienė.
R. Ača Special Investigation Service (STT) detained on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, as the director of the Administration of the Raseiniai municipality, took a big bribe, and in exchange could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai Bus Park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having bought directly from R. Ača or having participated in masking bribes for various financial operations.
In April of this year R. Ača was dismissed from office as head of administration by the council of Raseiniai district by the third attempt after expressed mistrust.
Former "Routine" March of this year became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas, he suspended membership of this party on Monday.
A few years ago, R. Ačas had failed to stand as a representative of the electoral committee "Your Raseiniai" in the mayor elections.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to nominate his candidacy in the Raseiniai mayor elections next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian peasants and Greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says that she is waiting for further law enforcement action - it will depend on whether she will be excluded from the work of the commission.
"I really don't make any big decisions today, this week, I think I'll make a decision.
I will see if there is a need, what charges are made, of course, I will take a decision, one way or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's time for her place," she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives in the Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Franckietis and the Head of "States" Ramūnas Karbauskas to separate himself from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission by transferring her to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She claims that further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission "will cause a lack of confidence in society and discredit the work of the important parliamentary monitoring committee".

President urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments in the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, opening the Trade and Investment Forum, President Grybauskaitė stressed that, when seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'unite our efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world', which addresses the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, 'overproduction and unfair competition'.
"The European Union has a very important commitment from China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important for the negotiation of a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Dalia Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening-up of China is important not only for Europe but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that the transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential for the environment of new investment relations," said Dalia Grybauskaitė.
"Cropped capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not only here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
Several heads of state participate in the exhibition, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, which amounted to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, Chinese imports exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some of the officials are concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing's special attention to Eastern Europe splits the unity of the EU.

The reason for the Lion Air plane disaster was revealed: loved ones of the dead were angry
Data from the black box of Lion Air's crashed Indonesian airline show that in at least four of its last flights, speedometer malfunctions occurred, reported by the researchers on Monday.
Soerian Tjahion, Chairman of the National Committee on Transport Security (NTSK), said that a similar incident occurred during the last four plane flights, including the fatal, when the liner fell into the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after the take-off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed during the disaster.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, actually the technical problem was speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said Mr Tjahjon during the press conference.
"Black box data showed that during two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem," he added.
"There are many rumors in social networks.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (data remained) about the four flights that had problems with the airspeed meter," said the NTSK manager.
During the meeting with the members of the families who died, Mr Tjahjono said that the information of the flight recorder is in line with the reports that the speed and height of the last flight had changed irregularly since the aircraft rose.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box that records the conversations in the pilot's cab.
Lion Air indicated that the technical failure detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, has not been invited to speak with the Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, who has moderated the meeting of family members with officials supervising the search for aircraft and victims' remains and disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed down when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Kirana, who, together with his brother Kusnan, founded Lion Air in 1999, introduce himself.
Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man who admitted himself as the father of the passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who served as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air has shown us no compassion."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana quickly left, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the victims.
Almost 140 dead, loaded parts of human remains have been handed over to police medical experts.
To date, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives questioned why a liner that was launched two months ago was allowed to fly, although during the 28th October flight from Bali to Jakarta, there was a breakdown, including a result of a dreading sudden downfall of the plane immediately after the takeoff.
Lion Air said that this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond by law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not recur.
Mr Tjahjono said that the large amount of small scraps and the fact that the scraps were spread in a relatively small area indicate that the liner was likely running into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
He didn't blow up in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when he touched the water, acted in big turns - this is shown by all the broken turbine blades," the officer explained.
The breakdown of Lion Air liner has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died when Garuda aircraft crashed near Medan.
After the crash, rescuers led the crash: a minor was hit
On Monday evening on the road Cancers - Plungė, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz hit Tilviks.
The cars were hit by a forkmouth, and three people were reported to have been injured.
It is reported that a BMW driver, born in 1999, went on the opposite side of the road and ran into a Mercedes-Benz car, where Dad, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firefighters.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz had her teeth shot in an accident.
All victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial facilitations to referenda
After approval by the Seimas of the ruling proposal to reduce the referendum cartel for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has more protection, the President will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"For the Constitution, more than half of the population voted - this is a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular to the items contained in its first section, should certainly be at least a minimum majority.
It is easy to predict that the President would really veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's internal politician said to the Radio of Knowledge on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamentals of the State - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the State, therefore reducing the number of votes necessary to replace these articles, according to Mr Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "an unmanageable risk".
"The President believes that there is no need for artificial facilitations, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people," he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas shall plan to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the referendum law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections one and fourteen of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote agree to this during the referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace Articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution by a referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved in September the veto of the President on amendments previously adopted by the Parliament which mitigated the requirements regarding the number of votes in the event of a change of citizenship, which defines Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution.
It is proposed that the referendum be reduced in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot currently, with some exceptions, have dual citizenship.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum will not be held - a sufficient number of people will not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "Bražka", therefore it is necessary to update them
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to grow, therefore it must be updated, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task which the State must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already drawing, because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into remote planning, it is the minimum we must do", said Mr. Masiulis at the communication conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of the external port of Klaipėda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we must complete the construction of roads, railways, external port in Klaipėda, clean up the airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we must already start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time," the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr Masiulis repeated that there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
"The condition of roads is not improving yet, because the funds are not enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even critical maintenance, such as motorways, is not enough.
We must set the amount to be devoted to road surveillance if we want their condition to improve," said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport sector services grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, which crossed Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU hauliers will have to return to the country of registration on a periodic basis.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to offer the tractor a permanent return home, because empty trucks would drive in Europe, burn fuel and increase emissions.
Most of this will be achieved by railways, since the cost will increase so much that part of the transport will pass on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr. Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with the guardians of heritage
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced to the Committee on Economics of the Seimas that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural use of Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CRD) Algimantas Degutis called the deliberations of Mr. Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950 ’ s is a value recorded in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide to remove it.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"Extracting this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal could be built, so that when you arrive in Vilnius, you would feel in a modern country, and not in such an interesting, truly not representing our country as an innovative one," said Mr. Masiulis last week in the Seimas.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with Rail Baltica railway by building an underground station.
This transport unit should be operational in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to be 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
In total, Kaunas Airport handled 1.2 million passengers last year.
What do Lithuanian troops do in Afghanistan?

Next year start direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar
Next spring, the largest passenger aircraft Boeing 767 flying on regular flights will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be owned by Madagascar, based on information provided by the tour organizer Itaka Lietuva by the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that the passengers of Blue panorama airlines will be able to choose between 259 economic class and 8 business class locations.
The new holiday direction will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominika Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, states that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday directions.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer season 2019.
For example, Novoturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister for Finance on a potential crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
"We always have to prepare for harder times.
What I want to be pleased about is that for the first time in the history of Lithuania we have been storing reserves for the third year in a row.
But it is also very important not to talk about illness," said Mr Shapoka during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister for Finance and Vice Minister Miguel Tuskienė participates in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discussed issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, since some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a specific tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how revenue from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget of Italy as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has made use of this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that ESM functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buracz.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently he was 120 years old since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balis Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiauliai Municipality, then Šiauliai Governorate.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have an excellent opportunity to remember how the life-expiring national rebirth has brought together many Lithuanian people, including brothers Burachus - Bali, Jonas and Bronius - from the very depth of the village - all creatives can participate in fostering, nurturing and preserving our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas has been travelling in the hands of his home country with his camera for more than 50 years and has provided a wide and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve rapidly disappearing national cultural deposits and had a rare ability to comprehend the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Buračas, Lithuania's landscape, mounds, our people, commemorated in everyday and festive environment, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burač’s legacy for describing national labour customs and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
In addition to the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions, the published material shows the progress of our civilisation over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupations.
The book’s manuscript is very rich in the works of the interwar Samogitia, especially the Cupishene, Šiauliai, Telsian, as well as the people of Aukštaitia and Dzukija, their holidays and descriptions of other traditions and customs written by Bali Buračas.
More than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs have been selected from some 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, which are grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture specific to the Cupish, the Scotch, and other areas of Aukštaitija and Samogitija.

The tragic fate of a couple: they died after just a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of Texas, a couple of newlyweds died in a helicopter disaster just hours earlier.
William Troy, 24 years old, and his peer wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight, when the helicopter entered the hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Surprisingly, the disaster occurred when the young men were about 20 miles [24 km] away, just as they were years old.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
Young people studied at Sam Hoston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Family Ranch, near Juvaldi, and went by a family-owned helicopter after the wedding feast.
The disaster occurred when the helicopter flew about 30 miles [24 km] away.
The newlyweds were flying to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board a plane and fly for the honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the final destination of the couple's journey.
"It is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence has been piloting the aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after take-off.
His rubble passed by a wide radius on a rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously exposed", said Craig Hatch of National Transport Security Board (NTSB) during the press conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to take the debris away and then look at it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that location, he said.
The cause of the accident has not yet been established and the preliminary NSB report should be published after two weeks.
The Prime Minister of Israel calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to the members of his party's "Likud" parliament, reported his office.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald, the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran during the period when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the President of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, Israel's Minister of Defence Avigdor Lyberman stated that the new sanctions would give a 'decisive' blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls 'the toughest sanctions of all time', were introduced following the decision taken and controversially assessed by Mr Trump in May to withdraw from the world power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
Sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and at removing Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long been opposed to this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish State is also saying that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance the militia groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow him to establish himself there from a military point of view.
Other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court renaissances the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The court will hear witnesses of the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, North town.
On Tuesday, Vilnius Regional Court decided that one of the witnesses of the case would be heard at the next hearing on 26 November in order to clarify all significant circumstances of the case.
In this case, an excusable sentence has already been handed down, but the prosecutor's office does not agree with it.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court, due to the fatal accident of a motorcyclist, justified the car driver who announced that the motorcyclist was driving in the city at a high speed and committed a gross violation.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the regional court to cancel the judgement of the district court and claims that E. Osipov is the most responsible for the accident, and the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
A family lawyer of a motorcyclist who has died also asks for the judgment to be set aside.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, at about 15.00, when the car "Škoda Fabia" driven by E. Osipov entered Žirmūnai Street from Lakūnai Street and faced the main road motorbike.
The prosecutor's office accused the man that the driver of the car had violated the Rules of the Road, which intended to give way to the road, and caused an accident - a man who died on the main road by motorcycle Piaggo.
Initial police reports indicate that the driver of the scooter died, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Rolandas Bužinskas, a judge of Vilnius District Court, has said that the experts found that the motorbike driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the permitted speed at that place is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such high speed," said the judge.
At that time, a busy driver of a car claimed to have driven just 5-6 kilometers an hour.
The driver who saw the obstacle tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who was driving from side to side of the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner employees died in Syria
Among the victims are five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
This is announced by the Nova Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian military corps has been deployed in the said territory, and a number of Syrian volunteers and "military personnel" have joined.
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide information on Russia's fate.
The former King of Belgium will have to pass the paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Fischer.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Seyly Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies parenthood.
According to the RTBF station, he can appeal to the Supreme Court against DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Fischer, the former man of Delphine's mother, is neither the father of the artist, nor the father of the artist.
Delphine asked for an appropriate investigation so that his father's daughter, Albert, could be recognised.
to distribute money to the parties of the CoR, but they will give nothing to the social workers
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
This spring, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), led by Parliament's Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilos, has been established, so far it is not foreseen to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the LRA in the event of a change in the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to lots.
Laura Matošityte, President of the CoR, informed the GCC that "this Thursday a meeting of the Commission is scheduled to decide on the allocation of the half-yearly budget grant to the parties".
According to her, it is up to the LRA to take a decision on this issue before 15 November.
It is planned to allocate EUR 2.751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the governing State and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberals Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, and the non-member Labour Party in the Seimas - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently participating Party of Order and Justice - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in the parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition to the Polish Election Action-Christian Family Union - about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the current law, which will be the basis for the budget allocation by the CoR, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow LSDDP established only this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
For this party has not yet participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the next three elections - the self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to political parties and budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the governing bodies, Mr Kirkilas, and the leader of the peasant-Greens Ramūnas Karbauskas, assure that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CoR and, according to Mr Matošaitytė, "grants will be allocated according to the legal order that exists so far".
It is true that the Head of the Committee has not rejected that if the Seimas rejects the president's veto this week or next week and new amendments regarding the allocation of budget funds to the parties take effect, a decision on the award of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, may be discussed in the committee.
"In making the decision we will take into account the entire legal environment, because we are the executive body to implement the laws," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and new laws came into force, additional money would be distributed to the parties by the Government after borrowing the corresponding amounts for this purpose.
The seven lots of grants already allocated would not be harmed by such a decision.

Poroshenko: clients of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 of them - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully according to the test procedures.
As President, I do not have an opportunity and I do not have to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in clarifying the murder of Mr Handziuk and "accepting the necessary responsibility" for the murderers, organisers and clients of the crime.
"After this case has been re-qualified to murder (the case), they are quite rightly and reasonably threatened with the sentence of life imprisonment," the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly called public demands for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the speeches made by the representatives of the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice wherever they may be'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would be more confused.
"I urge all the forces, both the authorities and the forces supporting the opposition, not to squander out on unsubstantiated arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - such as to build public confidence.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation for destabilising the situation in the country," he assured.
In July, Mr Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and acidified in the city of Cherson.
She was an adviser to this mayor of southern Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died in the hospital on Sunday.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lucenka, failed to explain the perpetrators of this attack.
After her death, the authorities were accused of being unable to carry out the investigation properly by public activists.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
'I am making my resignation statement today,' said Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament, reading his study report.
Parliament still has to accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional facilities to water - free facilities with the computer revolution of the 1970 ’ s.
The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates presented the high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water in water pipes, said Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation between solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years," Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates.
A technological toilet was created at the expense of a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
In seven years, the fund spent $200 million on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilizers or water.
In total, about 20 toilet models were created, according to Bill Gates.
Now the device is complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under five die every year because of poor sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already amounts to 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the toilet presentation glass with faeces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".
S. Sīla, elected president of the Association of Mass Football

Anxiety in France: Human death is a concern
On Monday, French health officials announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide in case of concern about several dozen people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The ANSES health agency announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide metam was taken after a new safety review started earlier this year before at least three of the poisonings started in September in the Department of Art and Loira.
In these cases, the government had already stopped the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained about eye and throat pricking and breathing problems in the Anje region, where there is a lot of salad juice.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not rush it," said Francoise Weber, Deputy Director of ANSES, to the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
The US Environment Agency (US EPA) regards the metam, one of the most common pesticides used in the US and Europe, as a 'expected human carcinogen'.
This pesticide, sold under names such as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new security check has to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not there are alternatives," said Mr Weber.
"We take care of the difficulties of salad juice growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their displeasure with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, near Nantes, more than half of the 35 000 tonnes of lettuce juice consumed in Europe each year are grown.
In the following season there will be "a lot less saladd juices, skaters and couples", last month, after the government stopped using the metam, the news agency AFP said Philippe Retreer, the head of the Federation of Producers of Nantes.

President Paul Biya has been sworn in Cameroon following the 7th term of office of the Controversial Elections
At a ceremony under the supervision of Parliament's President, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, for 85 years, Mr Biya promised to protect the 'unity and unity' of the West African State.
The oldest president of Africa, who has been ruling his country for 35 years, was declared a winner in the 7th October elections, with 71% of the votes cast.
However, the elections were darkened by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at a presbiterion school in the North-West region where English-speaking separatists conduct an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the north-west and neighbouring south-west province, the demand for autonomy was launched in the event of dissatisfied with alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and the economy.
In 2017, when Mr Biya refused to give up radically announced an independent state, the Republic of Amazon, and raised weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed this year during separatist attacks and government response operations.
More than 300 000 people have fled from violence: some cross the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-dead forests.
During the October elections in the North-West region, only 5% of the voters voted and 15% of the electorate voted in the south-west province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya has obtained two thirds of the votes.
Pre-election of Conservatives: errors due to inexperience
"Someplaces were missing - understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities have allowed them to use their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent," the politician said.
According to him, the complaints were received, but their content does not change substantially, and the infringements themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced - it was also news for them.
So not all our actions were in line with our order.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC that the principles we described should be respected.
These complaints do not, however, provide grounds for doubting the results," A. Anušauskas said.
According to the President of the CEC, there have been cases where ballot papers were not sealed - the ballot papers found in ballot papers were cancelled without a stamp.
There was a lack of space in some towns, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations concern several dozen ballot papers.
"Well, because the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference to the election results," explained Anušauskas.
It is said that the turnout of the party members in the elections was 55%, whereas the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday are also unchanged: 79% (16418 votes) voted for the winner Ingridas Šimonytė, while 21% (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas Ušackas.
On 17 November, the TS-LK Council will officially support the candidature of I. Šimonytė in the presidential elections next May.
Short says probably won't meet Putin in Paris
John Bolton, the national security adviser of the White House, said earlier that D. Trumpas would meet Putin in Paris, where this week the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be held.
However, on his way to the last meetings before the US Congress mid-term elections, Mr Trump declared that journalists were not sure whether this would be an appropriate opportunity to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, added the President of the White House, they will meet at the G-20 summit and 'probably many times will meet' after that.
Mr Trumps is still trying to reload his relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia intervened in the 2016 US Presidential elections.
Kęstutis Strupas requests the annulment of the VTEK Decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director-General of Santara clinics of Vilnius University, asks for the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (SCE) to be revoked - it recognises that the transactions have not been declared in good time and thus the law has been violated.
On Tuesday K. Strupas' complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests to cancel the decision of the VTEK on 23 May, BNS reported by the representative of the court Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltadūnė.
K. Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he claims that he understood the exception of the law.
In May, the VTEK announced that the then removed Director General of Santara clinics K. Strupas and Head of the Ambulatory rehabilitation department of Vilnius Republican University Hospital Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the law regulating declaration of private interests.
The investigation revealed that four transactions were declared not in compliance with the deadlines: in 2010 a loan was taken from the bank with the spouse, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, in 2017 a gift was given to the daughter - an apartment and in 1996 a loan was granted to the natural person together with the spouse and not repaid.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own but also your spouse’s data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of TV information from Info TV.
It has been explained whether K. Strupas and his spouse, the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital S. Strupienė duly and timely declared the transactions they had concluded.
Last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros, as announced by "Info TV".
However, the former head of the Santa Rican clinics and his wife did not state in their declarations of interests.
Law enforcement K. Strupas, along with at least ten other persons, has made allegations in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, illegal financial compensation was demanded from companies for winning purchases of public computers and software in clinics, it was concealed as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have negotiated at least five times during public procurement in the Santara clinics in the field of information technologies.
Mr Strup himself denies his fault.
The alleged professor of corruption, K. Strupas, was dismissed from the position of head of Santara clinics in September.
By decision of the Santara clinics' stakeholders, the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University have terminated employment relations with K. Strupai at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be managed temporarily by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition for the election of the new Director General is held, promising to announce it this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, who presented them on Monday at the forum "Replacement of educational content: foreign experience in solutions in Lithuania".
The Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke in the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of educational content in the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
"In accordance with the results of the international student achievement study PISA, students' achievements are below the OECD average," said Jurgita Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science.
According to OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in a report from the Ministry of Education and Science, Lithuania is too knowledge-oriented rather than a practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programs focus on students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but they also need it for children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
The Vice Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius presented changes in the content of general education, said that the volume of programs starting this school year will decrease, they will be more specific and disciplines more closely interrelated.
According to Vice Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent – they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of student evaluation will change into a cumulative score, the greater weight will be gained and informally acquired student competences.
The number of standardised tests will decrease.
Promising that the general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, connected to e-resources, a task bank.
Updating the content of education aims to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupils' achievements by a third, students' acquisition of modern competences at school and literacy in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million of EU and state budget funds to update its educational content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes updated during the 2019-2020 school year will be tested in part of schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism about the project of nearly EUR 8 million carried out by the Centre for Development of Education for the renewal of primary, primary and secondary education framework programmes.
For four years it is planned to allocate EUR 7.8 million, and at the beginning of October the first procurement of EUR 1.3 million was announced, which sought out educational programme promoters.
When the experts criticised this purchase, he was suspended, and J.Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science, dismissed Giedrius Vaidelelis, Director of the Centre for Development of Education.

Resigned Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lucenka
The Ukrainian Prosecutor General Jurijus Lucenka announced his resignation on Tuesday in the country's parliament due to the death of the acid-enriched fighter Katerina Gandziuk, announced by the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, a request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, and this must be submitted to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Lucenko presented the progress and results of law enforcement investigation into K. Gandziuk's murder order in the Supreme Rada.
In his speech to the parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but he expressed his disgust at the use of Gandziuk's death for politicians' public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption, and spoke publicly about police corruption in her home city of southern Ukraine in Cherson.
On July 31, the unknown attacker K. Gandziuk swung acid in his face.
On 4 November she died in hospital because of the injuries she suffered.
The opponents at the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine request an answer who killed Mr Gandziuk, aFP/Scanpix's photo.
According to Mr Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation consists of 12 persons possibly linked to Mr Gandziuk's murder order.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leakage of information, suspects received essential knowledge.
Mr Lucenko added that he personally knew Ms Gandziuk and was angry that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"If no one has any reason to say that someone clings to power, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament," says Mr Lucenko's speech in Rada in the Obozrevatel.
It is said that Mr Lucenko added that 'it is impossible for a country to allow double-governance when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for discovered crimes'.
Mr Lucenko is considered to be a close companion of the President of the country Peter Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following the prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Khokin, suspected of corruption of senior officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Ms Aurelija Vernickaitė, Deputy Minister for Energy, informed Elta, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not achieve the overall EU-level trajectory of the national renewable energy action plans - in 2015 it accounted for 6% of renewable energy.
The EC estimates that progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a number of difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a less important role at this stage.

The Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation of political corruption, has been instructed to explain possible unlawful influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this deadline by stating that "in public space there appeared significant information about possible unlawful influence and influence on political processes and state institutions".
A. Širinskienė in the draft states "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when referring to the Constitutional Court or trying to influence decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The reference to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by the opposition Conservatives.
The ruling "states" have found out that Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their applications.
I have an impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (SCE), the leaders of the 'states' are blaming the former collaborator Povil Urbšis.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Municipalities could instruct the members of VTEK to dismiss the former Head of the Prevention Division of the Commission Mindaugas Siauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to clarify the influence of interested persons or groups of them, influence on the conduct of elections, formation of coalitions, work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, election of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to competent authorities and how they have responded.
Researchers should submit their conclusions by 1 May of the following year.
An election campaign by the President, the European Parliament, will take place at that time.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the 'states'.
Two social workers have also been appointed as members, one "Organizer", one liberal and one Lithuanian Polish election campaign representative of the Christian Family Union.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskas, Chairman of the governing Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union.
According to him, the investigation carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGC) during the previous session in respect of essentially the same matters showed that the investigation should be continued.
The German head of internal intelligence has lost his post
Mr Maassen, who was 55, even more aroused by his statement that his problems were attributable to the 'radical left' coalition of Merkel.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, last weekend it became clear that, at the meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised the 'inanimate' immigration policy of Merkel.
The German Minister for the Interior, Horst Seehofer, who has defended the head of intelligence for a long time, stated at a press conference on Monday that the recent comments made by Mr Maassen were unacceptable and 'disillusioned' him personally.
Mr Seehofer, who himself was under pressure, both because of this dispute and because of his poor party presence in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to reserve Mr Maassen.

Body girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
Fancy girl with white blowing bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can the white swan floating toward the altar be larger than S or M size and still look attractive?
Plus with the reality show "Size (r) Evolution" the participants will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project this evening will shed tears of happiness - her boyfriend will appear on the filming ground.
"There are others who think that bigger girls don't get the attention or sight of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend himself is a sportsman, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require a figure to meet some standards from me," Aurika, who will speak to the show before she shows her wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it is a complex construction, it is rich in materials, dress is difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Some women also believe that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that the model of dress that is properly chosen really solves this "problem", - explained Robertas Kalinkinas, one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer.
The fate of the girls in the project R. Kalinkinas solves together with the entire commission – the Erika Vitulskiene, who opened the fashion house plus the size, photographer and star of social networks Naglis Bieranz and TV producer Laura Putas.
"In deciding which girl should say goodbye to the show, there are many conflicts between the members of the commission - we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show in different ways.
The task of demonstration of wedding dresses has been made even more difficult, and this - I can now tell you - has appeared to be two newcomers who were certainly not worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening of all meanings," says R. Kalinkinas.
Newcomers - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show famous for Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty Mother Dovilė - just like other girls participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and went to the best 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls in Vilnius city streets, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK audiences who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
Having received international recognition, the reality show of the bodies' beauty takes place in Lithuania for the second week – here, plus the size of the girls competed for the name of the first in the country plus the size of the star.
So far, only eight of them are left - and they all know that only one winner can be.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of reality show "Size (r) evolution" begins already this Monday evening at 20.30 p.m. on LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the most sexy man in the world
The U.S. magazine People has announced this year's most sexy man in the world.
It became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not feel funny when he spoke about the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?"
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexy today - laughing at the actors.
Speaking openly, Idris said that this title, it was a very pleasant feeling, which haughted his ego.
The British star is convinced that he has often received abusive words and ridicules, which have made his childhood difficult because, as he himself describes, he was "very high and inexpensive".
The young actor displeased his peers and became the object of bullying because of his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"As soon as I grew up moustaches and muscle became the coolest guy in my city's district," Idris smiles.
When a man loses his pride on the Osse screens, Elba works as a discotheque at parties held in Spain, and especially in rude Ibiza.
A leisure man enjoys the Thai boxing and has a line of fashion that he realizes by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor assures him that the most important thing in the world is his family, so he plans a wedding with the fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd most sexual man in the world elected by People magazine.
In 2017 the title was awarded to Blake Shelton.
In the Širvintai district, a man was killed at the time of drinking.

Managers no longer require 20 km when constructing waste incineration plants
Vilnius CHP plant is under construction near Gariūnai market.
Those in charge of the construction of waste incineration plants no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 miles [20 km] from the settlements.
On Monday Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environment Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law in the Seimas, which waives such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the group of 'states', who previously supported the provision on a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
The amendment by Mr Mažeika provides that, from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built with regard to environmental protection and public health protection requirements laid down by laws.
He admits that the amendments were triggered by the President's doubts about such a ban.
'In view of the definition of the territory of residence, it is clear that such places where the above-mentioned facilities could be built would be almost impossible to discover,' the chairman of the committee said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president’s veto adjustments to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for the permission of the Government to take decisions on the future of two plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provision, Mr Mazeika, does not propose an adjustment.
In Vilnius, the power plant with waste and biofuels is being built by the energy group Lietuvos energija and in Kaunas, together with Fortum, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The latter already burns waste in Klaipėda.

The leaders of Great Britain and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday on the complex issue of Northern Ireland, which is strangled by the Brexit negotiations, reported by Dublin.
In her telephone conversation, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called mechanism of the Insurance Measures Agreement, which would allow the United Kingdom Province of Northern Ireland to leave an open border with the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, says the report issued by the Irish Government.
In the interview, Mr May said 'opened the way for a review of the mechanism of insurance measures'.
'The Wardwar has made it clear that it is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the measures,' says the Government's report.
The Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the Single Market and the Customs Union next March.
Both parties agree on 'prohibition measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement has been signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied provisionally throughout the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit's Secretary Dominica Raab is trying to get Britain out of the agreement unilaterally in three months' time.
However, Mr Varadkar said to journalists in Dublin that his government cannot support this.
"The three-month or limited term insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they are to be written," he said.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed the breakthrough in Brexit's negotiations after a weekend report in Britain that an agreement is reached.
"I would say that we are making further progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr May's representative in London.
The European Commission's representative, Margaritis Schin, also said to journalists: 'We are not yet there'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration calling for the right to receive reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa.
'We call on the leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts,' says the Group's report.
They argue that the 'global information and communication area' is a common good which 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated in accordance with the principles of commitment to truth, approach to pluralism and rational methods of establishing facts," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for assistance from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticises 'false news', but regularly blamed for the distortion of facts.
World leaders should take a position on this issue when they gather for the 'Peace Forum' to be held in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based media freedom and protection of the rights of journalists, the reporters without borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdu Dufas, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas has approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety which provide that penalties for breaches of product safety must be increased.
Amendments were unanimously accepted in the Chamber.
As the member of the Seimas Committee on Health, Anton Vinkus, said, when speaking about the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
It also adapts its provisions to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is divided more fully and specifically among all the operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further violations, because the entities that have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations," said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give more power to market surveillance authorities and establish a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to label the product properly and thus ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, the State control of product safety by the market surveillance authorities does not grant access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of producers and suppliers, which makes the work of the authorities more difficult.
According to the Ministry's assessment, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect an infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law – 14 companies have done so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose on manufacturers an obligation to label the product properly, thereby ensuring its traceability, in order to facilitate market surveillance authorities' understanding of suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of economic entities that manufacture, place products on the market, carry out state product safety controls.
It is planned to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has made them available on the market, the service provider who has provided dangerous services (now between EUR 144 and EUR 1,448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CPC) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and the placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between EUR 868 and EUR 4 344) would be imposed.
Without the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products damage the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between EUR 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (now between EUR 5 792 and EUR 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25 thousand is imposed for infringement of product safety legislation (minimum fine not set), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.
A 10-year-old had a baby: a family member was raped
In Colombia, millions of people were shocked.
A 10 - year - old girl who was raped by an older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world because of the cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For a while, they were under medical supervision.
It's still a little while before the young mom and the baby go home.
"On the basis of the information I received from the police officers, the baby became pregnant after having been sexually exploited by a family member - brother," said the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted to one foreign TV.
The police investigate the case of rape and violence against the child.
Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in remote and remote areas
The troops from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of Oslo, the country's capital.
This is part of the NATO Exercise "Trisak Jung 2018" - the largest NATO Exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a long time after the 11 September terrorist attacks away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But they are most skilled in fighting in Arctic conditions, and these are their skills that are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers on the mountains east of Tynesett, often in the outermost and harshest areas, have been involved in staged battles against real British soldiers.
The soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wild nature, but in a harsh climate they have to stretch a much higher weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The troops staying in the camp say that they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like any other, especially resemble real warfare, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.
Premier League Autsaiders won the first season victory

Kaunas Vice-President, who has withdrawn, does not plan to return to politics
Former Vice-President of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left work in the municipality and the United Kaunas organization for support to Vygaudas Ušacks during the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time on the family", said Mr Mačiulis.
He also said that he was not going to participate in the next municipal elections.
Mr Mačiulis had not yet had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ušacks after losing the initial elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union on Sunday.
"If openly, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
It is clear that when Vygaudas withdraws from the further election fight, this stage of my life is over," said Mr Mačiulis.
He said that he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy regarding support to V. Ušacks, but regretted that "Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in international relations".
Mr. Mačiulis was a deputy mayor of Kaunas for a short time in 2011, and later he returned to this post after successful election of "United Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of Erudito Licejus, a private school, as well as several other companies.
Workers are plundering in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
When the Kaunas residents noticed the workers who were breaking up in Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally taking place.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Sužiedelis assured that there are changes to the protective roof covering of the south-west tower with a piece of protective wall.
According to the speaker, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn-out can coating in the state of emergency threatened the surrounding people - people could fall and injure - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also detrimental to heritage," explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be like those that were centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions", - G. Vežidėlis added that he wanted the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the practical side – roofs must protect them from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when dealing with heritage.
Prior to that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin as early as the Soviet era, so they had no historical value anymore," the Director of Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The employment contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not last more than three months after the signing of the contract.
"It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of November," said the museum director.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost EUR 24 thousand.
This amount, according to the speaker, was provided for in this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas.diena.lt has written, as according to the research carried out, Kaunas Castle could have looked earlier.

Now, for two weeks, military exercises with about 500 troops will take place in Pohang, South, and the Ministry of Defence reported in Seoul.
There are 28 500 soldiers stationed in South Korea.
Both countries have been organising joint military manoeuvres for many years, which Pyongyang calls 'provocation' and 'preparation for invasion'.
On Friday, North Korea threatened to renew its nuclear programme if Washington did not lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be 'seriously considered', said the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told TV that criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up his nuclear weapon.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet North Korea's envoy Kim Yong Cholu this week in New York City.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two significant US brain centres
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, which is based in Vilnius and has already been counting 13 years of activity, the U.S. will allow implementation of projects and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We worked in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries we analyse are also priorities for them," said Kojala.
The agreements point out that the EESC and the US authorities will work together on international project applications, exchange expertise and expertise, and organise expert visits.
This should be of particular benefit to Lithuanian analysts, because both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top analysts.
FPRI took seventh place in its category in the most recent World Analytical Centres ranking established by the University of Pennsylvania.
At that time, the CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work in the highest US political institutions, is top ten in the same rating category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the information space of the USA and encourage us to raise the quality cartel," said Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in distributing the upcoming EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision-makers and public spaces.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not maintained by targeted grants.
The EESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were easily injured when two buildings collapsed on Monday in Marseille, southern France, and fire service reported.
As the buildings fell down into the street, the clouds of dust rose.
Tens of firefighters worked at the site near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.

A member of the Afghan Special Forces shot an American instructor through training
North of Solt Lake City, the 39-year-old mayor of Nort Ogden, Brent Taylor, had a year's vacation to carry out his mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Force Headquarters, but had to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. military member, whose name has not yet been published, was injured during a Saturday attack that killed Mr Taylor's life.
According to the officials, Taylor died of a fire of infantry weapons.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, Chief of Utata National Guard, told journalists that Taylor helped to train and strengthen the capacity of the Afghan National Army.
The Utah media quoted NATO's report that Taylor was shot by one of the trained Special Forces troops and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains should be taken to Dover's Air Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He has previously carried out two missions in Iraq, which was also his second mission in Afghanistan.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Mr Taylor told the local media that he had been appointed to a team of advisers and instructors from one of the special forces in that country.
