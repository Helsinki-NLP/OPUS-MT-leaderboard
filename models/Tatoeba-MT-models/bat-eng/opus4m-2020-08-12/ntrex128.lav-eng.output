Members of the Wales Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility "to be perceived as a convenience"
Some members of the Assembly were concerned about the proposal to change their appointment to the MWP (Member of the Parliament of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM across the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour party AM explained that their group is concerned about "replays with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "single", but "pwp" means "kaka".
The Praid AM parties pointed out that none of the group "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
The representative of the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group is ready to consider the change of name, but added that MWP is very similar to Muppet, meaning "light".
In this context it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is spoken similarly to the English language Yorkshire dialect "u".
The assembly commission, which is currently preparing draft laws to change the name of the assembly, said: "The final decision on the terms to be used to designate the members of the assembly must, of course, be taken by the members of the assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which gave broad support to the assembly to change its name to the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the name of AM, the panel preferred "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the fight for agreement can be a headache for the Assembly spy Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill of change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the laws on disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
AM's final vote on what they will be called will be taken after discussing the laws and regulations.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on the change of name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was organised to resolve decades of disagreement with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, one of the plebisciths of changing the name, declared that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a matter that needs to be done to join the EU and NATO.
St. Mārtiņš' church calls to silence while the churches of Harlem are fighting for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to tell, they used to be on every corner of the bar and church," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there's no one else."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Barars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Even when talking to churches, he is worried that the money received when selling property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will have returned to their starting point".
The church, he added, will probably be replaced by apartment buildings with flats, where people will not help the remaining temples in the area.
"The majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and so the day when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will enter these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the black metropolis, the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St Martina 10 years later.
The original white methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, which had worshipped at the same time.
The black congregation of St Martins’ Church took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. On 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, he led a boycott of the working retailers who refused to recruit or give them promotion.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but since Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing to David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St Martin's church, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played this call game in July, used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger call game in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather told me that St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the past few months around St. Mārtiņš' church reflected the relationship between Architects and builders, some of which were attracted by secular power and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
The church council, made up of secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese in writing with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on costs" to the council, although the council has not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark hurts 13-year-olds in the lobster fishing area
The shark attacked a 13 - year - old kid in California on Saturday and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services told.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach beach in Ensinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends on Saturday morning had a dire about half an hour when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and then with the group went to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought it was just an admiration for the lobster he caught, but then he "understood that the boy screamed "I was saying!
I was told!"
The whole bone of his key was broken," Hammel said, who immediately noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I shouted everyone to leave the water: "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to Ray’s children’s hospital in San Diego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a species that was dangerous to humans.
Jails added that the upper part of the torso was injured.
The officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Ensinita for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for security reasons.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's is attacking "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with all-shop beauty shelves and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the large beauty market of GBP 2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow despite the decline in sales of fashion and household items, 11 shops in the country will try larger rows of beauty shelves and, if everything goes well, there will be more such shops next year.
In the beauty industry, money is invested when supermarkets are looking for the use of shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's informed that I would double my offer for beauty up to 3000 products, including such brands as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand areas similar to those in "Boots" stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique line of decorative cosmetics, where most products will be vegan friendly — increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the scent wholesaler Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and switching to small purchases of food every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that commodity outlets will become more and more similar to all-purpose stores, because the chain of shops is trying to fight discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has placed "Argos" outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several "Habitats" since it bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved sales of goods and made it more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended up defeating.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tested in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute on how to distribute income from pharmacy shops in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after 3 years ago, "Sainsbury's" sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to "Celesio", the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to this plan "Lloyds" will be tasked with adding a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for customers, we have changed the appearance of our beauty products' shelves and the impression they create.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a comfortable location means that now we are a charming goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter Jones after Holly Willouby gave up the 11 million-pound deal
Dragon Den's star Peter Jones "became angry" after the TV programme manager Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Viloubia has no time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The pair business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
"This Morning" 37-year-old broadcast manager used Instagram to announce she's leaving.
Holly Willouby has abandoned Dragon Den's star Peter Jones in anger because at the last moment she left their profitable lifestyle brand business — to focus on her new huge contracts with Mark & Spencer and ITV.
The information sources claim that Jones was "enraged" when a TV gold girl at a tense meeting in Marlow, Bakinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, worth up to GBP 1.5 million, meant that she had no time to devote to their home uniforms and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared with the Goop brand of Guinnett Platowe and, according to the hint, it will double the wealth of Vilouby, which is estimated to be GBP 11 million.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information: "Truly was the most important of the Holly priorities.
This should have become her long-term future, to which she would be devoted for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlova there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the head of "This Morning" – one of the most financially profitable stars – can pay millions of dollars to leave the company because he has invested a lot of money in various products, from pillows and candles to clothes and goods for home use, and will delay their placing on the market even more.
And that can mean ending a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willouby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for 10 years.
Vilouby "Truly" together with Keps was founded in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the chair in March.
Both couples are on vacation, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in the Boldvina TV producer company.
Viloubia must become the ambassador of the M&S brand, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones yesterday said, "We don't want to comment on his business!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He laughed about the criticism that will be received from news companies about a comment that some may find 'indecent to the President' and about the fact that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has the President given up so much?
The tramp said in his supposed voice of a news dictator.
"I didn't give up anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting once more after Tramp in June at their initial meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearisation in North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US's "response" to North Korea's initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
The tramp was much more optimistic in its speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of missile testing, assistance in the release of prisoners, and the return of remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's simple to give the President an impression, but instead of standing there 10 000 people trying to get into this closely populated area, we have 200 here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lomboca earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombardoq were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to initiate foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they said very clearly that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a certain problem," said Miss Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" collects a group for driving to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palas to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
In view of the fact that earthquakes are taking place regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared with its natural fury.
Although there are shelters for tsunamis in Aceh (Aceh), these are rare along other shores.
The fact that Palas was not given a warning about the tsunami, although the warning was valid, may also have influenced human death.
Even in the most favourable times, movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital who had anchored in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of the infrastructure destroyed by Indonesia the centre of his election campaign and has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr Joko's administration and is waiting for him to be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with the long-standing problem of tensions between the sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Starige rebalances match against Chelsea with ambition
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing his life against Chelsea in the Prime Minister League, receiving the gate at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Saturday minutes 89.
Starige received a play from Xherdan Shaqiri, who was about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea Gate when his team lost at 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the further gate table.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally overflowed the head of Cep Arrizabalag, which is in the jump, and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get as much time for myself," Starige explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touching the ball, and without much thought, kicking."
"Chelsea" at midnight was led by 1:0 after 25 minutes the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before turning to the middle of the field and jumping as quickly as possible on the side of Liverpool.
Kovachich played fast and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful blow between the players, allowing Azard to enter the zone.
Azards exceeded the speed of protection and completed the combination by blowing the left leg into the further room in the network, passing "Livepool" to Alison Becker.
Liverpool Champions League groups will fight Napoli in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15.00.
Chelsea will meet at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832, and early Sunday the state disaster agency announced.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5-magnith earthquake, which struck the country on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high, reports the agency's representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the news conference.
The city of Palas, where more than 380 000 people live, was covered by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police suspect of a woman being arrested by a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was launched this morning when a woman found her body in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old wounded victim was found at 7.55, at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police have called on people in this area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something in their car video recorders to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as reported by the police, they are involved in informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mūza, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building or leave it.
He was not able to say a word when he learned what had happened.
Citizens are informed that it will take hours to be allowed to return.
There was a story of a policeman telling a man that the entire neighborhood was being perceived as a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene.
She goes on to say, "It's so terrible!"
Two afternoons, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was placed right outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment house.
Anyone with information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by 30 September by calling 0800 555 111 to name 247.
Kromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest "historic rewrite" scandal
Abandoning it would be ethically justified in the light of activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in his fanatical Puritan followers destroying so many of England's cultural and religious monuments.
However, Crick's Cromwell's suggestion was described as "silence" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the current debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Castle would also be the goal.
Cromwell himself ordered neither the destruction of icons during the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell shows his view in the 19th century and is part of historiography as a person that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: "Many of Cromwells - perhaps more than they were today at the end of the 19th century - considered Parliament's defender against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue on whether this is really a completely accurate representation of the subject.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a well-known person who represents one of the parties of the breed of that time.
His achievements as the protector of the Lords are worthy of praise and praise."
Pig-slaughter to death collapsed the farmer in China
According to information on the local media, the pig was attacked and killed by a farmer in the south-west of China.
The man — only his name, Yuan — was found dead with a broken artery, all in one blood at a pig house on the market in the Guizhou province of Lupanshui, reported on Sunday "South China Morning Post".
A pig is about to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in a pig house in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
He and his cousin were reported to have arrived on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the nearby pig house was standing open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig house with blood on his mouth.
According to information, the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy vepri had broken the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin said, "just his name Wu" and the article "Guiyang Evening News" are mentioned.
The safety cell material showed how Juan entered the market on Thursday at around 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Juan did not belong to him or to his cousin.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the vepris was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence on the spot.
According to the information, Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other attacks by pigs are known to occur in humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, which resulted in critical injuries to the man.
Another 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pig in Wales kept the farmers under pressure on the tractor until the animal was terrified by his wife.
After farmers at Oregon in 2012 ate his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "pistole shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to invade, they are very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of Orkan Rosa brings a great deal of strength to the South-West of the United States
It is predicted that the plane Rose will weaken as it passes through the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will bring flooding in the north and southwest of Mexico in the next few days.
At 5 p.m. (after East American time), Rose’s gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the Category 1 orchestra, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, low pressure is formed above the Pacific, moving eastwards to the east coast of the United States. Ross with the force of tropical storm approaching the Lower California peninsula, on Monday it will begin to drive the moisture mass deep from the tropical band northwards to the southwest of the United States.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in the Monday part of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low - pressure raging, will create a large, strong rainy area in the south-west in the next few days.
1 to 4 inches (~2.6 to 10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
The moisture will cause the rains deep from the tropical zone, which will reach 2-3 inches (~5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In part south-west, especially in most Arizona, rain is expected to reach up to 24 inches (~5.2–101 cm).
There may be sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersal of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to walk into the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into rapid rivers, while thunderstorms will bring local fragrant winds and sand storms.
Low pressure dragged in close proximity will bring local strong rains on the southern California coastline.
Rainwaters are possible, which together will exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm) and can cause low mud flow and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
Separate dispersed tropical rains Arizona will begin to approach late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain takes over the wider territory late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Strong rains on Tuesday will spread in the Four Corner region (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as temperatures are falling in the Arctic and the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Dees Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
The following days will try to develop and expand lasting summer heat.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm in many parts of the United States, reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Fahrenheit) and 80 degrees Fahrenheit in large areas from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, which would exceed an average of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a strong likelihood of temperatures in the eastern part of the United States exceeding the average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing in the Britta Caveno case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched six television channels enthusiastically, according to Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the candidate of the Supreme Court, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment, which she claims occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political unarranged, broadcasting companies stopped regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would investigate charges during the week.
Forda informed the Committee on Justice of the Senate that she is absolutely sure that Capeno took care of her drink and tried to remove clothes during the high school party.
Caveno unfailingly showed that he was absolutely convinced that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report, 20.4 million people watched all this on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the interest of medium viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually comes up with problems when it comes to people looking at the offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of viewers of the exclusion games or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Caveno, was the largest audience, with an average of 5.69 million all day long hearings, informed Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million, informed Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleuk was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Capeno, the senator noticed the CNN and the CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the protesters' indignation, tried to get the elevator to the hearing of the Committee on Justice.
In a live broadcast of CNN, he stood for several minutes in a stabbed eye, as barren.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "you own power, while so many women are helpless."
Fleuk explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he was told that he had more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was happening live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was going to vote for the nomination of Capeno for voting in the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal with the accusations against the candidate that had been claimed by a democratic minority next week.
The Fleika was partly persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Koons and several other senators, Fleuk made his decision.
The choice of the flute was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes for the approval of Capeno without an investigation.
President Tramp has ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May charges critics of political games against Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Teresa Maye, people who criticised her plan to leave the European Union were accused of "political games" with the future of Britain and the destruction of national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa Maya arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister of Meja Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit's plan for the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, called Chequers Plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "fully absurd".
Form Sims shooting: police arrested Dieton Simpson, suspected of murder of LSU player
The police have arrested the suspect for killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and arrested as a second-rank murderer, reported to the Baton Rouge police station.
The officials released a video showing Sims’ clash with Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The CBS subsidiary, WAFB, reports that the police found glasses at the scene of the crime and found the blood of Simpson on them.
After the police interrogation of Simpson, he informed him that he had been admitted to the shooting of Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was granted a security of $350,000.
On Friday, a team of medical experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish Church issued a provisional statement stating that death was caused by a shot in the head that touched the neck.
The Department thanks the Police Refugee Operational Group of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Policy Laboratory, the police of the South University and the residents of the territory for their assistance in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, the director of LSU sport, thanked the lawmakers of the territory for their "excellence and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet (6 inch (~1,98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
In the last season in one game he scored on average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "wronged" and "shocked" about Wade's death.
"This is what a man is always worried about," said Wade.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash that rises from the Pokatepetla volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital city.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The centre observed multiple seduction and shaking.
Images on social networks showed that car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco, are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicalians have noticed the activation of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since a major earthquake of 7.1 Magniths hit the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash between the independent protestors and the public order police and, when thousands of opponents joined the demonstrations, to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on secession in Catalonia.
The group of masked secession supporters, who were prevented by the public order police, left them with eggs and shed powdery colours to form dark dust clouds on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day, the police used stacks to prevent the fights.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters were involved in a confrontation with united protesters who said, "For a long time for Spain!"
Fourteen people were given medical help during protests because of minor injuries, reports the local newspapers.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the area taken over remains under great strain.
Voters were convinced about independence, although the voter was low and those who were against separation voted largely boycott.
According to Catalonia officials, almost 1000 people were injured last year, when the police tried to stop voting at electoral stations throughout the region and violent clashes broke out.
The independence support groups were on duty on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narkis Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer hopes that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting the independence of Catalonia won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have fought to maintain progress this year, because several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and awaited for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed on the phone to support the protest police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in detention to trial since last year, announced that he would stand as candidates for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Handling in European elections is the best way to expose the regression of democratic values and the repression brought against us by the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Men arrested after crashing the car in the building
Three men (33, 34, and 39 years old) were arrested after the vehicle was repeatedly hit by a building in London.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Bleming informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Maybe it was shot at the car at the same time.
Mengo impact allows "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first gate ensured "Livingston" victory
The sponsored Livingston surprised Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games, which was played by Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive, because Gary Holt's team levelled out the situation with "Hibernian".
Gerard's team hasn't won guests this season, and next Sunday they have to meet with the leader "Hearts", from which they lag behind eight points.
Prior to this, on Thursday, the Rangers welcomed the Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his series without loss to six games, and Chief Trainer Holt has still not felt the taste of defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't use the opportunity for dull guests
The Holt team with its own direct game, which made it difficult for the "Rangers" in many ways, had to be in the lead long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt at the gate, then Alan Litgow's attempt, after slipping into his feet, to delay Craig Halkett's head over the gate line, was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the decisive gates came.
Ranger allowed a free-blow, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to give the opportunity to Meng, who hit and got the gate from the middle of the zone.
At this stage "Rangers" managed the ball, but the protection of guests turned out to be inpercussible and the goal guard Liam Kelly was not hindered in particular.
This continued during the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the diligence of Ranger's goalkeeper, Alan McGregor, and Litgov abandoned the gate in the Livingston combination.
In the Livingston zone, centred bombs continued to appear, but two calls for punishment — after the Halpet fight for the ball with the substitute Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" Livingston performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alasdair Lamont in Tony Meši Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent in continuing to outperform expectations by improving performance.
Their playing style and personality have practically not changed since their return to the highest echelon, but Holts deserves great praise for how he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining first class organized protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Workall alert.
However, the Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into the area of the hosts — and it is basically an invitation to wake up "Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne with shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25 000 people for security reasons, not allowing them to gather before the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to take him to themselves.
The protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions created by a guest, some of whom regard Turkish Germany as a hero while others despise it as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies in collision with a car
A bikeman died in a car crash in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, on the road section with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and medical help was provided, but the man died on site.
The collision took place several months after another biker died on Chailders Street, about a mile from the Sunday collision point.
The police service in the capital city announced that police officers are involved in identifying a man and informing their relatives.
There are closed roads and buses on the scene, but car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six workers injured during the disorder
The Prison Office reports that six prison workers were injured in disorderly men's strict regime prisons.
The disturbances occurred in HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorches, about 9.30 a.m. on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent an emergency involving eight prisoners and confined to a single wing, the staff of the Special Service Tornado were involved.
The employees were treated with mild facial injuries at the site.
A representative of the prison service stated: "In order to resolve the HMP Long Lartin incident, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were medically assisted for injuries.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a prison chief was reported to have been treated in hospital following an attack by a prisoner.
And last October, those responsible for the control of the smuggles were sent to prison to resolve the serious disturbances in which the staff had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orcano Roza Feniks, Las Vegas and Soltleixitija are threatened with sudden flooding (likely to benefit the land affected by the drought)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early in the beginning of the next week, when the Orange Rose, with its remaining force, will travel across the desert southwest, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday to the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, the south-east of California and the Utah, including the Phoenix, Flagstaph, Las Vegas and Soltleixy.
Rose is expected to move right across the Fenix on Tuesday, coming with the case late on Monday.
National Meteorological Service in Frenix Twitter stated that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within 200 miles (320 km) of Fenix!
Katrina (in 1967) was an orchestra 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest models of National Hurricane Center predict 2-4 inches (~5.08-10.2 cm) of rain, reaching as many as 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other desert south-west areas, including the central part of the Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 inches (~2.54-5.08 cm), reaching 4 inches (~10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rose’s rain can become a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is of very serious concern, some of the rainstorms are likely to be of benefit, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported by weather.com.
First, the route of the Orcano Rose leads to the Lower California peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still with the power of the orchestra on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm faces colder Pacific waters and so slows down.
Therefore, the orchestra is expected to reach Mexico on Monday afternoon or morning with the power of a tropical storm.
In the case of the region, Mexico can be strong, with a significant risk of flooding.
"The rain is expected to reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the south-west of Sonora, with precipitation likely reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico like a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then move across Arizona and reach the Utah south on Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remains is the very strong rainfall in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and the US desert south-west," said the National Center of the Orkanes.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsommer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for a murder attempt after a 16 - year - old boy with a wounded wound was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 CST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
The police reported that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in the Redstock area, Eivon and Sommerset.
The police have called upon anyone who might have a mobile phone material about what happened.
Tramp says that Caveno has suffered from the "wrongness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote on the Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump declared at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Tramp stressed that Caveno had suffered from the "wrongness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Caveno gave a witness to the Congress, where she strongly and emotionally denied any charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, both of which were teenagers.
Forda also gave evidence of her accusations during the hearing.
The President announced on Saturday that "The people of America saw" Caveno's "excellence, ability and courage" that day.
"The vote on the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history of serving the people," he announced to the supporter crowd in Western Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the nomination around him, talking about the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates."
The tramp argued that the Democrats had undertaken the mission of "present and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate regarding the nomination of Caveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
The officials reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away when gigantic waves hit the shores after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for the festival in Pale on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves hit the coast on the chair, washing many with death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami broke out after a severe earthquake of 7.5 logs.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they became victims," informed Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indian disaster reduction agency BNB, in a warning in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it broke everything on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people climbed into trees to escape, and survived," he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palau.
The photos taken by the disaster agency on the flight show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
After crumbling the coastal city continued to shout on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT stated in its statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped in Hirosim during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have strengthened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide", and informed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and the damage could be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"Communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal," informed Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are travelling to the regions affected by the disaster.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been worse," the organisation informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not informing that the tsunami had hit Pala, although the officials claimed that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
A video on social networks shows that a man desperately calls people on the street floor on the top floor of the building and approaches the tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, washing out buildings and machines.
The news agency Reuters was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electrical power, which disabled communication in Palas, making it difficult for officials to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The officials stated that the army had begun to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuaters still need food and other basic goods.
The city airport is only open for aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Dooseba told us that the employees of "World Vision" who had successfully reached the city of Palas from Dongala, Dongala, and now were living in the tarpaulin roofs in the office yard, passed through the scenes of the damage.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that were destroyed," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even after relief teams determinedly began to organise relief for disaster victims, some complained that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian legislation, the financing, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the area of destruction is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government announces, "Well, it's a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been established."
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become wonders that would make life more gloomy during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was printed under the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, had prepared two of the missing paraglider games in Asia that took place this month earlier in Indonesia.
Other members of the hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught the burden of emotion."
Mr Gendon recalled that after the paraglider in the team spread news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent the reports of WhatsApp to the participants of the Palais competition who participated in the beach festival for hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thief plunders 26 750 dollars during ATM filling in the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement by the Newport Police Department, thieves stole 26 750 dollars in Brink's office in the Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
"The driver emptyed the entertainment complex ATM and was prepared to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "flagged Brink's employee from the back" and stole the bag with the ATM money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Canje West: rapper changes his name to Je
Reper Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Having announced the replacement on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: "A being previously known as Canji West."
For some time now, 41-year-old West was called Je and used the title of his eighth album, which was published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The show's creators tell us that he replaces the singer Arian Grande who stopped working for an "emotional cause".
West has said that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it is also of religious significance.
"I believe that "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You"," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Canje, which means "only one," followed by "Ye", which is the reflection on the good and the bad in us, on our confusion, on everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous repers who have changed their names.
Sea Combus, known until now as Puff Daddy, Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love Brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with the West, has and has not used the sign of thought and the capital letters.
The President-elect of Mexico promises not to use the army for civilians
The President-elect of Mexico, Andre Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody return to students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday "Tlatelco Plaza" never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Army units shot a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drew young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various U.S. government bodies made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally lacks a strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: it aims to become a key country in the area of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A twofold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind in the US, and the next cardinal shift in artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the USA.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is Executive Director of "Silution Ventures", which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, "Face+".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melon) University he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that beat America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lie acknowledged the technology competition organised by the previous US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when he would be prepared for the next time to identify people with ideas for the future.
"Scientists in the USA often have to work very hard to get government grants," said Lee.
"Not China attracts leading scientists, but big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lighthouses to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its performance in the area of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be awarded automatically to people with a PhD in Philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defense Department established a joint artificial intelligence centre to bring together partners from industry and academics, and White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA (the Central Organisation for Research and Development of the Ministry of Defence of the USA) announced a 2 billion-dollar contribution to the initiative entitled "AI Next".
In turn, the National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation, which was intended to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been in operation for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia by taking a step that will prevent the disputes that have lasted for decades with Greece, which have blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, underlines that its northern neighbour's name shows claims on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in the opposition insist that changes will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter's activity will reach at least 50% of what is needed to make the referendum valid.
The referendum newsletter asks: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by concluding an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that is worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely, under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the title, Parliament will need a 2/3 majority.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities had been reported by 1 afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old Vladimir, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at the tents set by those who had referendums in boycotts.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a raised head, not through the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zayev states that NATO membership will launch the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will cast a vote in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote was cast.
He said the result "yes" "will confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum – less than the required activity.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telema TV showed that 57 percent of the voters planned to take part in the vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western Government, which came to power last May.
Watch: The Manchester "City" Serhio Aguero lavates through the entire Brighton protection to get the gate
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling won the "Brighton" protection by allowing Manchester City on Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win at 2:0.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal in 65 minutes was ridiculously light.
The Argentinian attacker received a play in the middle of the plot at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and jumped into the free space.
Then the four green shirts envelops Agvero.
He overturned the ball into one guard, and then he ran over several more Brighton fields.
Then he made a play left, reaching Sterling.
The attacker of the English center used his first touch to play back Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat the "Brigton" goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, striking the ball on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," Pep Guardiana, the manager of "City", told the reporters.
"We discussed playing with him 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We're lucky he got the gate at that time.
But it was Sterling, which provided Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The gate was made in 29 minutes.
Agvero got a bomb in that game deep in the Brighton area.
He sent the ball with a beautiful hit along the Leroy Sane's left leg caviar.
In Sanée, he had several beats until Sterling was entrusted with carrying the ball to the next gatepost.
The Sky Blues Centre attacker easily transmitted the bomb into the network just before crossing the border.
"City" will fight with "Hoffenheim" Champions League group on Tuesday at 12.55 at "Rhein-Neckar-Aena" stadium in Zinshami, Germany.
Shercer wants to get a problem with Rockies
As "Nationals" did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to resume.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of this opportunity on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies has a lively shut-off game. And Rockies In the Western League group of National Leagues is leading with one game against Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies has printed at least a white card with 5:2 wins the Nationals Friday night, but has still not won its first title in the Division.
"Even though we play the same way, we can at least have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with a crowd and a second team, will probably be the most irritated one I will face this year.
And why would I not want to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as it says, is ready to let Shercer make a throw.
Shercer, for whom it will be the 34th beginning, conducted a drop session on Thursday in the off-field part of the "bullpen" and will throw the ball on Sunday during the usual rest period.
"Washington" is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strings 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Tramp to host Western Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno, had entered into the situation, at the same time talking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
The tramp continued: 'You see this terrible, terrible group of democrat radicals who are acting right now.
And they are determined to recover power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting action.
They don't care what they're going to hurt, who has to violate them to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, has undertaken a mission to "present and resist".
"And you've seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "wrong, evil, unkind and false."
He named it Dianne Feinstein, the senator of the Senate Committee on Democracy, to whom the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you flood the document?
Hmm, what is this about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant to the open
It wasn't surprising that Momentum activists in my local party wanted to put me under censorship.
After all, I am so far in the last parliamentary line of the Labour Party, which was informed that he was not desirable — all of this because we are not hiding our opinion.
With my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan had a similar roll over, because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the Censorship movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policies, national security, Europe ironically, but these were issues where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Communication on the Labour meeting in the East of Nottingham states on Friday that 'we want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my local Labour Member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different, and promises of a 'better, more lenient' policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views were similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would not have otherwise accepted, whether they are national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly - and I don't really care what I say - there is a tirade about using social networks, calling for a ban on standing in the next elections, deposing that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are confronted with a series of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to avoid them.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization ready for diversity of opinion and with every censure or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowed.
Over the last two years, I have often been advised not to go on plows, think what I'm talking about, and then "all will be fine".
But that's not why I decided to engage in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the neglect of the Técher government, which had literally led my school class to collapse, I had the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I been in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had reason to doubt my stance on political issues and areas where I disagreed with the current government.
For those who moved the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is moving decisively towards Brexita, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to say is not to the Momentum of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour: I am proud I can serve you, and I promise that no threat of denying candidate or reminders that no one in politics is irreplaceable will prevent me from acting as I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unspeaked "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts may have had a certain degree of convergence of the final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unspeakable team of ten.
After all, it was both their great protection and the much better use of the opportunities that led the hosts, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we've still not been defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All the respect "Ayr", they used their opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt by Frazier Climo put it "Ayr", but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors had awarded the game, changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot caught an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased the management of "Ayr" with a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, thus "Ayr" for a break went on 17-5.
But Melrose started halfway through a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Begot, reduced the delay to 5 points.
Then there was a lasting break, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported to the trucks away from the field, but when the game resumed "Ayr" moved fast ahead when Staffford McDowall made an attempt that Klimo realized.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, subsequently received the yellow card, and once again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player — an attempt by Bruce Colvine, who was not realized.
However, the owners got tough, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to catch Klimo without a ball, from the penalty corridor, McFerson carried out a tachdaun at the back of the "Ayr" clay.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the beginning of the resuming after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's drive in the field and sent the Flange Player Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
The "Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the "Still Game" series, Ford Kieran, seems to be planning to engage in hospitality business, because it turned out that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays in Jack Jarvis' popular BBC show, which he creates and participates in together with his ancient partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Kürnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang (Craiglang).
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although "Scottish Sun" source pointed out that Kürnan planned to engage in Glasgow's "glowing restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol around the Flote Headquarters in Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based vessels from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with a motto: "We have the right to the sea.
Its recovery is our duty."
In Bolivia trapped on land, memories of Chile in the 19th - century bloody conflict of the lost coastline are still alive, as are the longings to sail again in the Pacific.
These expectations have probably been the highest since decades since Bolivia awaited the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and calm in its spirit and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with positive thoughts," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's request that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile be obliged to discuss the granting of a sovereign exit to the seas to Bolivia.
The Bolivian charismatic President Evo Morales, who is waiting for a controversial fight for the reelection next year, is also very interested in Monday's judgment.
"We're close to recovering the Pacific," he was thrilled at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if one were to happen, no major changes are to be expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and its representatives have stated that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is given no more than six months after the final examination shows that the case "was not complicated" was explained by international legislative expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years have not moved the Bolivian case forward, but, on the contrary, delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric has stunned the rest of the good will in the Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once continue negotiations, but after this, it will be very difficult to hold the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former president Edwardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court had taken its decision unusually quickly.
Monday Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts from which both sides will benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used maritime problems as political cops.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will not give up nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Rio spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed ready to resume the deadlocked diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Chen.
Ri claims that these are "fantasias" to hope that the US will ever force North Korea to take its knees to the end of the Korea War's non-repealed sanctions and non-elections.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Pheniana really wants to give up the arms that the state probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenian next month to prepare for the next Kim's meeting with Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive head cover line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the audience with a row of absurd, huge head wearable items in the 2019 Spring/Summer Season Collection that dazzled on the background of the style set by the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s greatest makeup was a beautiful beige hat decorated with a wide edge of feathers that swallows its heads.
Massive accessories included watermelons, magic hats, and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your heads warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips sewn, and they served Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the formations reminded me of the ability to dive my breath, with a tube and glasses, and another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with a massive fashion, it's time.
Styl's observers believe that the giant aubs are probably on the way to your nearest High Street.
Large hats immediately became popular after La Bomba appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very unpractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another big piece of tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as large as the swimsuit model that carried it.
Red-yellow Rafia bag, decorated with rafia beakers and equipped with white leather handle, took a special place in the spring/summer 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, explained to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central business street shops next summer because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge size accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a reputation for outstanding educational institutions and have maintained it in 2018, when outstanding exam results were obtained once again, which is further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other public events.
These schools, with a total of 30 000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the objective of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relations and gain trust from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages reached the highest mark of A.
Data from the Scottish Council of Independent Schools for 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in Chinese, and 72 percent received the same grade, 69 percent in German, and 63 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an optional subject, are valued as high in independent school programmes as subjects of the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics group.
A 2014 survey of the British Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17 percent of employers mentioned a lack of language skills as a reason for inability to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, as job opportunities that require language skills grow.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them a real benefit in the future from such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent did not know foreign languages well enough to keep talking, while French was the only language to speak two-digit numbers of people, 15 percent.
That is why the contribution to language teaching is important for today's children.
A number of languages, in particular the languages of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of Britain, according to plans up to 2020.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
In Scotland, independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that prepares children and to providing them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scotland's young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (This is to be done).

Lebron in the debut "Lakers" on Sunday in San Diego
Fans have finally expected the moment when Lebron's first game in Los Angeles "Lakers" will take place.
Lake Walton, a coach at Lake Walton, has announced that James will play on Sunday at the pre-season opening game against Denver's Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is up to us to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed the "Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel recorded on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing this week's practice, James was asked about his plans for a series of six pre-season games at Lakers.
"In this stage of my career I do not need pre-seasonal games to prepare," he said.
Time of the tram stay in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts today in Wieling, West Virginia, a series of accommodations.
This is the first of five Trampla's planned myths next week, including stopping in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice of filling the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of Trampa is to obtain support in the forthcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control in Congress after the vote was cast in November.
When will the tramp stay in West Virginia be held today and how can you watch it online?
The tram is planned for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the tram stay in West Virginia online via YouTube.
It is expected that Trump will talk about hearing this week in the case of candidate of the Supreme Court Breta Caveno, which has been made tense by accusations of sex crimes, and a vote of the Senate is expected to postpone approval for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main aim of this headquarters is to help improve the situation of the Republicans, which are expected in November.
As a result, President Trampa's campaign shows that the task of this next week's five settlements is to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives" according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will visit the state as much as possible, because we start a lively campaign season," said Reuters, a representative of the trampa campaign who did not want to reveal his name.
This evening's meeting, which is planned for "Wesbanco Arena" in Vīlinga, is likely to attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent.
The tramp is trying to help the West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help improve his results in the surveys," says Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Raidera Cup 2018: The United States has shown determination to fight to keep high expectations of Sunday's singles
After three sessions in "one word" Wednesday afternoon game in "foursome" format, it was possible exactly what was needed for this Raider Cup.
The athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in competitions such as these.
So, on which side do they think there's luck now?
"They were at the lead with six points, but now with four, because I think that means in a way that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth on his way.
Europe is, of course, a priority, because it is in the lead with 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
Spitt explained that Americans believe that the wind blows their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points out of four.
The spat has been destructive from the first point of hit to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those gutular victorious calls became louder when his round continued, a decisive blow in a hole was made to reach four times the same number of beats when he and Thomas had left behind two beats in two.
His blow in the hole, which reached his victory 15 , was perceived with a similar cry, from them, of his conviction that the American team has not yet been expelled.
"It is really necessary to rock deep, and worry about your match," Spit said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes for success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple lags behind four points and will not be able to harm.
Molywood was the only couple who lived without boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the nine last pits on Friday morning.
This process and way their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flywood with Molinari will be the most popular players that can ensure a potential European victory when the sun goes over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly dealt with this morning's hero in the form of Serhio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Boggie and the two doubles in the front nines led to the Spanish and Swedish kess, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
But there is no one on Sunday who will help you cope.
In the formats of "fourall" and "foursome" games, it is so exciting to watch in the vicinity due to the interaction of couples, watch what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can change the situation instantly.
Europe has so far played a better role as a team, and it is far from leading before the last day, but this competition in the 'foursome' format has shown that the US team is determined to fight, which many, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
European selection for the Raidera Cup on the last day is at the lead 10-6
The last day of the European Raider Cup will begin with a pleasant leadership after the Saturday "fourall" and "foursome" competitions ended with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two victories over the hardworking Tiger Woods, which increased the number of points "Le Golf National" to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in order to preserve the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning race in the "fourfalls" format, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The United States was more vigorous in resisting the "foursomes" format, winning two matches, but unable to correct the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points in Sunday's 12 singles to save the trophy.
Flywood is the first European first-year-old who won four points in a row with Mollinari, called Molliwood (Molliwood) after a sensational weekend is only the second couple in the history of the Raider Cup, which scored four points in the first four matches.
In Patrick Reed they then won a bright game of tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sympathetic result of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, at times showed a great game, but he lost 19 out of 29 match in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "flourballs", returned to partner Henry Stanson's "foursomes" to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who ranks first and second in the world.
Europe failed to achieve its full goal, although the day in south-west Paris was a pleasant and blowing mild wind.
Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, the three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They squeezed 2&1 against the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter's "fourballs" format and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Raider Cup has the team played 4 points in deficit uniforms, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) team is enough only to have a single score to preserve the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, it looks like Sunday's attack will be problematic.
North Korea announced that it would not arm itself "in any case" without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust towards the United States, and North Korea will never unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never unilaterally arm the first."
Although Ri repeated the well-known criticisms of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a 'phasing-out' approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for the gradual steps taken, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chenun and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has announced that Phenjana must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to respond to the call to alleviate the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that "denuclearisation must be first", and increases the level of pressure generated by sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even opposing the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on our knees is the empty fantasies of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri was not talking about the intentions for the second Kim's meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned when speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister highlighted three meetings of Kim with the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months, and added: "If the other half had been South Korea rather than the United States on this issue of denuclearisation, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have been at such a impasse."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from what he said last year when he announced to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable for North Korea's missiles to be diverted to the continental part of the US after the "Dad President" Trump had named Kim a "missile" in a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, the Tramp, which threatened to 'destruct' North Korea completely last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Tramp announced that he had not planned a certain period, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia emphasize that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyang for its achievements.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously without error until a definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to bring about the depletion of funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside of the UN General Assembly meetings and then informed that he would visit Phenian again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were not successful.
He went away from Phenyan in July, saying that progress had been made, but in a few hours' time, North Korea accused him of “gangster worthy claims”.
North Korea's meeting with Munas this month committed to dismantling a landfill of weapons and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject on how to relax enough
A new subject of study at Harvard University this year has made it possible for students to sleep more, and it is an attempt to counter the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes caffeine-filled study throughout the night.
One teacher found that students of the world’s best university often lack basic knowledge about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he considers to be the first subject of this type of study in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject after talking about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and asked, "Why do I tell it only now that I'm in the last course?"
She found that nobody had ever explained to her how important sleep is — who surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, the subject was first released, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sport achievements, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and executive director of university health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students were suffering from serious sleeplessness during the week.
The hour long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of the doors of dormitories, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sport is affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping routines.
In another part students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the student town with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how cigarette smoking will affect your health," Professor Chaisler added.
He said that the culture in which he was proud of his ability to learn all night still exists and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overexploitation and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain as the lack of sleep turns the brain into a hungering mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californiaian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheissler develop the subject after he had participated in one of the professor’s lectures last year, at Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive postgraduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheissler recommends that students install an alarm not only for the time when they get up, but also for the time when they go to bed, as well as to keep in mind how people harm the "blue lights" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps, because they can disrupt the rhythms of the night, making it difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Men's gate overturns Gerard's men
"Rangers" had another sad game for guests when Dolly Menga's hit Steven Gerrard's confused team decided to lose 1-0 against Livingston.
"Ibrox" team hoped to win the first victory on his way out since February 4:1 triumph "St Johnstone", but Gary Holt's team made his second loss in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the ball gate seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of "Rangers" inspiration did not look like an attempt to equalize the result.
"Rangers" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to the third place, and only "Hibernian" exceeds it in terms of the difference in the gate.
And "Rangers" may have another problem, because the assistant judge Kalum Spence needed medical help because of a head injury, which apparently was caused by a further end of the throw.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took away one point from "Hearts" last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-deployed team oppressed opponents in each episode.
Rangers may have managed the ball more often, but Livingston made better use of what their actions were.
They had to get the gate two minutes after the start, when the first game of Menga sent Scott Pittman in the direction of Allan McGregor's gate, but the center player missed his great opportunity.
Then a long free beat by Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence, Alan Litgow, was able to send the ball just far past the rear pillar.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that the last third of the game was hoped, not believed that it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless believed that he should have done a 15-minute sentence after he had faced Steven Lawless, but the judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
"Rangers" performed only two beats in the first half of the year, but the former "Ibrox" goalguard Liam Kelly was not particularly hindered, neither Lassana Coulibly's head strike nor the modest end of the attack by Ovie Ejaria.
Although "Livingston" could have changed the course of the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their efforts.
Rangers already didn't deal again with Jacobs' planned long combination.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent a bomb to Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately influenced the game, since he sent the bomb to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly tried to block him immediately from his line.
But "Livingston" continued to make guests play as they like, doing one long beat after another to Litgov and Halket.
The Holt team would have been able to continue the leadership at the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgov hit his head from the corner.
Ranger's substitute Glenn Middleton late in the game asked for another penalty hit, after being hit by Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanaha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... One day Johannes Wilhelm, Hans, was born in Germany as a physicist.
The Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, the result of which was, after all, a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Gueger counter that has taken its place in science has also taken its place in pop culture, such as the 1950 Bells of Coronado (Coronado calls), where externally unconvincing cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans played their main role:
A man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you will be able to hear how the atoms released by these minerals work."
Evans: "Actually, it really works!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
Yet, the invention named after him continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the bad cells during therapy
Using this method, the patient produces immune cells that are converted into a laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise the bad cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining cells from the patient's immune system, converting them into a laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 that is characteristic of several tumours, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says Professor Jay Berzofsky: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from a patient, to which they "learned" how to attack cancer cells, has been shown to be effective in one type of leukaemia.
After visiting the SNL, Kanje West, dressed in the MAGA hat, attacked Trump critics.
It didn't end well
Canje West was hurled into a studio "Saturday Night Live" show after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand as a candidate for the 2020 presidential election.
He finished that evening with the third song called "Ghost Town", during which he wearing the "Make America Great" hat, he began to bounce loud phrases about the democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to the white people, they ask: "How can you like the Trump? He is a racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a show with Matt Damon in the main role where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Justice on the charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with the West’s pity on social networks was loaded by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West like this.
And West also lamented to the audience that he had been mistreated behind him because of his head.
"They mocked me in the backstages!
They said, "Don't go out with that hat in your head!"
They laughed at me!
And they said I've lost contact with reality," said West, according to the "Washington Examiner".
West continued: "You see what happens when you lose contact with reality?" and promised to put on "your Superman's settlement" because it means you can't tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Varety" reported that his comments caused the whistles of the viewers at least twice, but the members of the show team looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press: "The studio had a complete silence."
The wedding was last invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend rapper Mac Miller.
The West was embarrassing many with a song (I Love it) that he performed in the costume of a champagne bottle.
The wedding was supported by the conservative leader of TPUSA, Canada Turner, whose website Twitter recorded: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: PATICOS, THAT YOU DO NOT SAY TO THE POOL!"
But the conversation show manager Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply "was what he was, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his "art") who I believe supports and plows with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "a presence previously known as Kanji West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the legend of the contemporaneous music Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then on "the scene artist, who was previously known as Prince".
Indictment of murder attempt at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of an attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Belfast Master's Court on Monday.
Appeals will be heard by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of the "Trong Games" Kitt Herrington targets the toxic manhood
Another Herrington is known as John Snow HBO's brutal medieval fantasy series "Trong Games".
But the 31-year-old actor has turned to the brutal character's stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he thought there was a problem, and asked how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, his partner of the Trione Games, also 31 years old, admitted that this problem was important to him.
"I can't think about what mistakes we made with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach young men about this problem when they grow up in view of the current problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He said, "What is inherited, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be treated as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because young men are clearly having problems."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any continuation of the "Trong Games" or in the throat, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are tired".
Starting from November Kitts will play a key role in the renewed Sam Shepard's "True West", which is a story about the film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rose as the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Trong Games".
"I met my wife in this show, because it in a way ensured my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
In the fantasy series that won the Rose Emmy Prize, another character, John Snow's favorite Igrith, played.
In June 2018, the couple saluted into the family ownership of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/Hide: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual relations, suggesting changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, and Chinese health officials were informed at the conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 years.
The transmission of HIV through sexual activity is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of under-protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of the response to the problem.
Maxina Waters denies that the employee flooded the data of Republican senators, is against the "dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, the US Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters denied the claims that her staff member had published personal information from three US Republican senators on Wikipedia’s legislative pages.
The democrat of Los Angeles insisted that statements are distributed by the "ultra right" wing allies and websites.
"Lying, lying and even more despicable lies," Waters insisted on Twitter in her statement.
The flooded information is reported to include residential addresses and telephone numbers owned by US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from U.S.A.
Online information appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when a hearing took place in the Senate group about the accusations of Bret Caveno nominated for the Supreme Court in sexually inappropriate behaviour.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Capeno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the origin of the records was linked to the Waters office, and disclosed information about Waters personnel, informed Hills.
"This unfounded statement is absolutely false and completely false!" insisted Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of this fraudulent and false statement, is in no way responsible for the release of information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely false and completely false!"
The Waters Statement soon led to online criticism, including the criticism of Ari Fleischer, former Press Secretary of the White House.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleicher.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to the member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be a soldier.
He may not speak about the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
The task of Fleicher was to compare Waters' reaction with the democratic fall of Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for the loss of Waters' chair in the interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's great if he meets the truth," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognised as legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Jonnie Coal 3" review — a half-way show by Rovan Atkinson on spy films
It has become common to look for association with Brexit in every new film with a British taste, and this seems to apply to this one, which has revived, the franchise of Johnny English's adventure comedy, which began in 2003 with "Jony English" and reborn in 2011 with "Jony English returns".
Does the tooth purify for itself, about how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has the right, with his eloquent eyes and an unusually moving face, to create a strait after the second revitalization — his name more than anything else signals that he is a wide range of comical characters designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims for a charming subtlety, is a little Cluzo, a little Mr Bin, and a little bit of the guy who plays one note at the "Chariots of Fire" theme in London's 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also based on the traveler's and international, incomprehensible character, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Coal went to put on helicopters in medieval armour, and the propeller blades are for a moment limping against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is very visible, but humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially because "serious" cinema brands like "007" and "Unlikely Mission" are confidently using comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor gives the impression that it is devoted to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny English's absurd fate is not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's silent film tricks in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on Britain getting into a serious keg.
Cyber hacker has broken into Britain's super-secret spy Internet network, revealing the identities of all British agents in this field, displeasing an active agent — the sadly small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pompous and conflict-fashioned person who has already lost his full political popularity: Emma Tomson does his best with Teresa Maya, but there is not much in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform us that since all active spies have been revealed, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the untaught Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a fine educational establishment, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes) because he offers to learn the profession of spy from the very foundations.
The coal is delivered back to the extraordinary meeting of Whitehollo and is combined with its former many victims' assistant Bo, which is also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun personality that only becomes important at the end of the film — a role that Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin have returned to her secret service and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful, fatal woman, Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers have dangerously settled the harismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Walt, who is portrayed as Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer keza.
Coal and Bo are beginning their wild fun odyssies: masked as ofidants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion by smuggled into the Walt luxury yacht; and Coal causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual realities on the head of the display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volt building.
All that is possible is done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains many elements of children’s television.
A lot of moderate elements.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn is going to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week and pay for five.
It is reported that the party wants the management of companies to grant the savings from the artificial intellectual revolution to the workers, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea "will respond" to the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy in favour of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the highest representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that changes in politics will be announced by the end of this year.
"This will not happen on one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that meets the party's objective of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party, as such, does not support this desire at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The working week of four days is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonal explained that he was determined to take power away from the 'mass of directors' and from the 'speculators' of public service companies.
The shadow ministers also plan to mean that the existing medium-sized shareholders in the water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour Government could implement the "deduction" due to the injustices allowed.
He also approved plans to include employees in company boards and to set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of private sector capital to employees who would receive up to GBP 500 each year in dividends.
Lindsey Gram and John Kennedy respond "60 Minutes," or the FBI investigation in the Caveno case could change their opinion
The investigation of the FBI against the accusation brought by the judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the office could lead any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the programme's 60 Minute correspondent, interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left a more open impression than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, addressing the hearing procedure, I said I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, Grem's vote is obviously stoned.
"I made a decision about Britta Caveno, and there will be a grievous charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bretts strongly denied it," added Gram, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be made."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive amount of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Grand Moore of the Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, rappers Cardi B and Shann Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the International Defense Group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting an increasing number of people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other important action to raise awareness of poverty eradication.
But how successful has the Global City movement been, with another 12 years left for the goal to be achieved?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "clegitivism" when people think they really can influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizens movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than USD 37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and statements resulting from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and implementers established in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow up fully", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end their malnutrition after more than 4700 Twitter messages from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, we can leave a poor diet in the history," said Tracey Ullman, a representative of The Power of Nutrition, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that, following the launch of more than 5000 measures, by calling on the UK Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced the allocation of funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens commented: "It will be a long and long road in which we will kneel and suffer failures at times.
However, as has been done by the great civil rights and anti-partite movements before us, we will also succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shann Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborr-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the military fleet for "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports – says Home Minister
"In case of need" Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East," said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's activity in Syria, especially in areas where it operates under a legitimate government invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, through its navy, can make sure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed a public who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation called himself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they were actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and substitution," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the tramp administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, the Trampa Administration Officer and also the U.S. President Donald Trump are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trampa, would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fervent resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier," said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Minister of Energy Rico Perya.
The US has expressed its negative position against Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation – the German Industry Federation (BDI) – has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential elections
On Saturday, the senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, announced that she was seriously considering to stand as President after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting of the Council, Vorena confirmed in Holika, Massachusetts, that she was considering to stand as a candidate for presidential elections.
"It is high time there were women in D.C. who would "reconstruct" the imperfect government, which also means a woman-president," says The Hill.
"After 6 November I will carefully consider my candidacy in the US Presidential elections."
During the meeting of the Council, Warena referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the depths of my heart about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warena has openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Caveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Warren said: "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's supporters do not believe that she should stand as a candidate for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand for elections, according to a poll conducted by the Sufolka University's Political Research Centre/Boston Globe newspaper.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The survey revealed that former governor, Deval Patrick, had more support, receiving 38 percent of the election candidate and 48 percent against.
Also in connection with possible candidates for the 2020 elections, such high-profile names as former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Vermont Senator Childrenie Sanders appear.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed that Baiden was committed to providing a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peylin quotes Treka Peylin in PTSS in Donald Trampa
Trak Peylin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called up for military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he passes after his return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of the PTSS and a certain amount of vulnerability that our soldiers return to," she said to the public at the meeting in Tuls, Oklahoma.
Peilina called his arrest a "obvious problem that everyone pretends to see" and said about her son and other vetarians of war that "they come back a little different, they come back fortified, they come back thinking about whether their fellow soldiers and pilots are respected, as well as all the other members of the military have given to this country".
According to Den Bennett, a representative of the Vassil police department, was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against women and possession of weapons in a state of dizziness.
18 States, Colombian district challenges a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian district are in favour of a legal challenge for a new US policy that prevents the victims of asylum who fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian district presented a brief presentation to the court adviser in Washington to support the asylum seeker facing the obstacles created by this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Session proceedings initiated by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal politics is not open.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Board of Appeal, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, Prosecutor General of the District of Colombia Karl Racin announced that the new policy "despite the laws of state, federal and international law introduced by the decades".
"The Federal Law provides that all applications for asylum are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim concerned, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said the court adviser's brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his presentation that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "enforce the necessary workforce".
In June, General Jeff Sessions asked judges in immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Shelter is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sixons said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, doubling the number of survivors in the search process
The situation became more and more severe for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, reassuring his tortured baby in the city's evacuation centre in Palu.
"Emergency medical services bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is a deficit."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and passing through water to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 Magnithode earthquakes were overcrowded.
Some of the injured people, including Dwi Harris, who had broken their spine and shoulder, lay outside of the Pale Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of outside because of the constant strong post-crust.
His eyes began to cry, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was printed in wall ruins," said Harris to the news agency "Associated Press", adding that his family had come to town for wedding purposes.
"I heard my wife be called for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador charges China in intimidation attempts through propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper launched a four - page advertisement highlighting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the premium paid by China Daily in the Iowa state's most selling newspaper Des Moines Register, indicting China's attempt to intervene in the 6 November US Congress elections, but China denies it.
The accusation made by the trampa that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what the US officials said to the Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is quite normal for foreign governments to place ads to facilitate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a tradition of freedom of speech and free press for its good America, by inserting paid advertising "Des Moines Register," said Branstad.
"On the other hand, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not see such a true reflection of the different views that Chinese citizens may have due to the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media are under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from the mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been raised, analysts have warned that they will have a negative reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been prepared to give their voice.
Such things cannot be withdrawn, "Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the University of Siracus School of Politics, told the Saturday article in The Hill.
Reich questions that the last-minute encouragement of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation will be a big reason to soothe angry voters.
"Womens will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative to MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C."
On Friday morning, protestors in the forehead of the Senate sang "November is coming!" when Republicans, under the authority of the Committee on the Judiciary, chose to continue with the nomination of Capeno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially between fluctuating voters living in suburbs and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often do not go to elections even if they do not like the President."
Even before the public testimony of Forda, in which she presented allegations of sexual violence from the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts mention a possible failure if Republicans continued to nominate this candidate.
"The Republican Party has become a havoc chaos," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
'This is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Capeno will be sentenced, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they treated him,' said Guy Cecil, Director of the news channel, who directs this group, which helps to elect democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans are slightly divided in relation to who to believe in the Ford and Caveno testimonies, slightly more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in Caveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said that Caveno might or must have lied about his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleuk's encouragement, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another accused person, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda showed in the Senate Committee on Justice that he had committed a sexual attack on him in drinking at the age of 17.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the post of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies in Yale in the 1980s has shown her his genius at a party.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the Berners-Lie Open Source Platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "doom the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in the same browser.
The personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines which and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers through data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by Bērners-Lie, Bruce, IBM, some external developers hired to work on the project, and a voluntary coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Burners-Lie said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce complete changes by fully turning over all their business models overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an article published on Saturday by Medium, Berners-Lie said that "Inrupt" "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet into a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lie has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lie will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am truly optimistic about this new era," added Berners-Leigh.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian Cross during World War I
For 100 years, its home city has been celebrating an event when the only clergyman of the Church of England received Victoria's cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lt-Col Bernard Venus received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglisei and Lehaukorta.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he never learned about the highest British military award.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received a significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Ven led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the huge fires caused by very thick mist and cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and led it forward with the greatest courage before the cannon zone was defeated by three groups.
Colonel Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Venus (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to do, and which, at the same time, is also a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown at the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Ven said that he felt "honored by participating in this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by many people".
MMA fans were waiting all night for Bellator 206, but instead they were waiting for Pig Pep
Imagine spending the whole night at the top to see Bellator 206, but in the end you're not allowed to watch this main event.
In San José, 13 battles were included in the Aphis, including six major maps broadcast live throughout the night on the UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to come against each other, the viewers in the UK were uneasy to switch to Pig Pep.
Some were in a state of misunderstood when they stayed awake all night until early dawn, waiting for a fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change of broadcast to children's cartoon as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 this type of content is not acceptable, therefore the switch to the children's program took place," explained Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication.
"Peppea pig," "yes."
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said he would work on schedule planning so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"Thinking about the repetition of the broadcast, I think we can solve it somehow," said Cocker.
"But the clock is there six o'clock on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem by Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many texts appeared after the switch, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But that was not the case, and it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem next time.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as has been the case so far). We tried to please the fans, but we tried too hard.
This is a failure."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale did not feel good enough for his sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley say that they grew up feeling less valuable than others because of their sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
Visiting the first Radio 4 programme "Desert Island Discs" led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term program, Krsty Young, has gone to rest for several months due to the disease.
Having appeared as being excluded from the Laverne's first program, Dale said that as she grew up, she felt "less than others" because "the society does not assume that both girls and boys can like it".
He said, "Until today, the feeling that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main driving force that has given me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" so that people would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and has taken advantage of its appearance in this year's Games of Friendship in Australia, calling even more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he was happy that he was able to live openly and without difficulty and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "wonk unprepared".
Dalely married the 20 - year - old Oscar Prize winner last year, claiming that age difference has never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics were 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became the parent of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"A year ago, everything that was important to me was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son, Robert, has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years of age from brain cancer.
Dalely said that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Dale was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him she won't be there anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dalely took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive into the hosts at the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song — Heather Small's performance Proud, which resonated with him on the way to the Olympic Games and was still invading the goose.
The Desert Island Discs program can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11.15 after British summer time.
Mikelson, who left the form, plays a Saturday Rayder Cup on the reserve game
The American Phil Mikkelson will set the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup play match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
Captain Jim Furyk, who is already participating for the 12th time in the two-year championship, landed on a reserve bench for six-six-four ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as has often been the case with the US teams, the five-fold winner divided his day by acting as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what suppresses him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense fight at Le Golf National's uneven course, where irregular beats are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, Mikelson will fight the exact British open championship winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four match this week.
If Americans that lag behind four points, starting with 12 single-game matches, succeed in leading, the Michelson match could play a crucial role.
Furik expressed his confidence in his teammate without words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, gave me his back, put his hand on me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He is very confident of himself.
He is an outstanding sportsman who has given so many of these teams earlier and this week as well.
I don't think I've imagined him playing in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything hung in the same way, and we'll count on it.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mikelson will hand over Nick Faldo's record in relation to the most played match in the Raider Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Raider Cup career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has gained 18 wins, 20 losses and seven unarranged games, even though Furik claimed that his presence brought some intangible benefits to the team.
"He is fun, sarcastic and witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he is a great member of the team," he explained.
"In my opinion, the younger players liked to impress him also this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly disappear
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from his experience that a significant rise in leadership in the fight for the Raider Cup in the last day's uniforms can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dane debuted in the 1997 Games in Valderram, where a team of opponents, the captain of which was Seve Ballesteros, won five points over the Americans, but only now got to the finish line with only a small number of points, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were in leadership in Valderram; we were in leadership in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only with a little predominance," said Bjorne (in the picture), following the 2018 graduation group victory with 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, appearing in leadership at the 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show both to me and to every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you'll give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show you your best performance!
This will not end until the resulting points are visible on the screen.
Our aim is to get this trophy, and let us focus on it.
I've always said that I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what happens to us on the other side – the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorne added: "I never rejoiced early.
New challenges await us tomorrow.
Tomorrow's an individual game, and that's a completely different thing.
It's great if at times when everything goes well, you have a partner next to you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully tested.
This message must be passed on to your players, i.e. they will give themselves everything in the game next days.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team, Captain Jim Furik will see to it that his players show their best performance directly in individual games and not in partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these important last days’ tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later as part of the defeat, when European teams won a sensational success, which is later known as Miracle at Medinah in the golf world.
"I remember every fucking word," he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, joined his players in the last day of the fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get into the quick break you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a high pressure on the middle games.
We created our own composition and ranked the guys in the way we thought they were right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counter-attack, and he ranked Rory McLroy's main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pooler's first part of the list.
"I put the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the tournament," said Bjorn in relation to the chosen single players.
Putting the new German warship back into operation
The latest frigate of the German military fleet had to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the ageing warships of the Cold War, but it will not happen at least until next year due to the erroneous systems and increasing costs, it reported to the local media.
The entry into service of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" of the class of Baden-Württemberg has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, as reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship had to join the car fleet in 2014, but unpleasant post-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the karaflot in 2007 at a distance, will replace the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with powerful guns, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it must be possible to deploy new frigates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the most recent technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will be obsolete by the time of entry into service, in the note "Die Zeit".
The unsuccessful fregate F125 last year was seen in all headings when the German caraflote officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the karaflot returned the ship to the yard after delivery.
There were little known reasons for this, but German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render a warship invalid if it were used in a combat mission.
The software weaknesses were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is only half of the senior staff of Bremen class fregas.
It also turned out that the vessel has too much weight, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the car fleet to improve it in the future.
It is considered that 7000 tonnes of the heavy-duty ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the erroneous equipment, the costs of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
The cost is said to have reached €3.1 billion instead of the initially estimated €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new fractures are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about a decrease in the German Navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, admitted that the warfloat really 'starts with a shortage of vessels'.
The official claimed that this problem has increased significantly over time, as old ships are taken out of service and no new ones are delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class members had joined the Caraflot.
National Trust listens to the secret bats life
A new study by a Scottish highland owner focuses on discovering how bats use the landscape in the food search process.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity about these unique behaviours of flying mammals and contribute to their protection measures in the future.
Scotch "National Trust" scientists in Invereves gardens in Westeros will explore pundurs bats, phygmy bats, as well as brown long straps and water night bats.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations, which will track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species are carrying out specific activities.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behaviour of bats.
The NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting bat shelters and loss of residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can sandwich paper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as cats attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night - hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a complex echo-location method to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, check bats and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even created in Scotland the first and only special bat reserve "Threave" owned by Damphries and Galway, home to eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideal for bats.
"Here is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a suitable habitat in general.
But there are a lot of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need for survival."
He stressed that it was important to check whether bats would stay in the site before the maintenance work was carried out, as it could be that up to 400 females and their babies were killed as a result of the unwitting destruction of one female hideout, possibly destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, obstructed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we just don't know how they go."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape by ordering lawyers to sue the German journal
Christiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape of charges against him as "false news" claiming that people "will pay attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published these statements.
The football star of Portuguese origin and Turin Juventus is accused of rape by Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he paid the woman 375 000 US dollars to keep her silent about this incident, it said on Friday "Der Spiegel".
A few hours after these statements were made to Ronald, 33, using Instagram's online video, addressed 142 million followers, calling this information about "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the fifth winner of the Ballon d'Or award in the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's okay," the player added when he smiled.
According to Reuters's information, the Ronald lawyers are going to sue the magazine Der Spiegel for the statements they have made, which they have called "the provision of unacceptable information on the grounds of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the player would claim compensation for "mortal damage to the extent that it corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years".
This incident took place in June 2009 in the "suite" class room of the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by the State Clark District Court of Nevada, it was reported that after a visit to the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player’s hotel room, where he analized the woman.
Majorga claims that after this incident, Ronald fell into the knees and said that he was "99 percent "good boy"" but fell into the temptation of this "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of injuries at the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "feared of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she does not want to accept the terms of this settlement anymore because the incident has left a lasting injury.
At the moment when these statements were made, Ronald was going to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros went to Juventus, Italy.
Brexsit: United Kingdom "forever repentant" loss of car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom "repents it forever" if it loses its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexita," said Greg Clark, business secretary.
They are "disturbed" by the fact that the company Toyota UK has announced BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the Burnstone plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that a delay at the borders in the case of Brexita could unagreed put jobs at stake.
The Burnstone factory, which produces the Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnstone.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW claims, for example, that after Brexit it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is the threatened supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexita.
The Toyota production line operates on the principle of "to check at the time" where cars made on demand come to parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disturbances at the border which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company "Toyota" would not be able to detain more than one day worth of inventory at its Dērbishir factory, so it would have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) drawn up by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was 'precisely calculated in order to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
"The proof of this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to fully pursue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long term, rising costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaton for 24 years and has been in the factory as a union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "I can say from experience that once a job disappears, it doesn't come back."
The government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
A tram meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, reports White House
The important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "deployed for one more week", because the fight regarding the candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court Britta Kaveno continues, and she reported on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein supervises special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian elections, the link between the means used by Trampa and Russia, and possible violations of the rule of law by the President.
For months now, Washington has been running for the release of the Deputy Prosecutor General and will therefore threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of negotiations with Trump and the possibility of abandoning the President with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where the talk about his resignation shook.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trump was announced at the UN General Assembly in New York.
The tramp said that "preferably" would not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a collision with hearing of the Senate's Committee on Courts, in which both Caveno and one of the women who accused them of committing sexual abuse – Dr. Kristīne Bleij Forda.
On Friday, Tramps ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the accusations made by Caveno, continuing to delay the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary of the tram, visited Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all things that happen around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters contest this statement: Sandersa has not held a press warning from the White House since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of brilliance was not linked to the displeasure of the television reporter "sacrifice of praise", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are the desires of praise."
She then proposed a direct contact between Trump, which would increase the interest of the press.
"The President takes part in more questions and answers sessions than any President before him," she said and, without giving any further information, she added: "We are interested in the number."
Sandersa claimed that it would continue to be urgent, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is undoubtedly better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do a lot of this, and you see that we have done it a lot in recent weeks, and this will take place instead of a press flash when you can talk to the President of the United States."
The tramp regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason for this this week in New York by giving the reporting population an uncontrolled and at times strange expression.
Minister for Health writes to EU staff in Scotland NHS on fear of Brexita
The Minister for Health has signed up for EU staff working with the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish you endurance after Brexita.
The MSP sent a letter to Jean Freeman for less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal, which led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
I would therefore like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both inside and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After the head injury Christian Abercromby is undergoing an emergency operation
In Tennessee, the guard of Tigers, Kristion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation following a head injury, which he won in a Saturday game in which, with the result of 31-27 concessions from the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ, a sports reporter from Tennessee.
The head coach of the state team in Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injury occurred shortly before midnight.
"He came to the side line and said it collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercromby was on the sidelines, the coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, then they put him on the carriers and brought him for further investigation.
A state official in Tennessee told Nashville, WSMV reporter in Tennessee, Chris Harris, that Abercromby was removed from the medical center of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that for the time being "there is no information about the type/threshold of the injury", and the team in Tennessee is trying to understand at what point this injury occurred.
Abercromby, a member of the Red Shirt, is in his first season after Iloniz was replaced by Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had carried out five blocks in total, which in this season amounted to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the resulting additional funds will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased State fee will apply to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to GBP 120 million can be collected per year for the provision of assistance to homeless persons.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and transferring the received additional funds to help the homeless, it will today announce Teresa Maya.
This is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at better prices and to address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased national levy will apply to persons and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional money being devoted to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level of charges introduced two years ago for the purchase and lease of a second home, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury foresees that such a step can add up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built London's property is purchased by non-residents, thus striking prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access their homes.
Many territories of a prosperous country, especially in the capital, have become "pocus cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land without using it, and urged Mrs Meja to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to address the British housing problem.
Mr Corbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on rent control and removal from housing without reason.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs Meja said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream – that is, every young generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means getting our housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, its hardworking British population.
For many, the dream of their home has become too distant, and the harsh problem of homeless people is still topical."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to drive Scotland
Jack Ross, CEO of Sunderland, says that his main goal is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he went to "Stadium of Light" after "St Mirren" was re-directed to the Scottish Prime Minister last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that was all," Ross said for the Scotch "BBC" broadcast.
"But I grew up with my father watching the Scotland games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in managing the club."
The predecessors of Rosa in the management of the Sunderland Club are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of "Alloa Athletic" states that he has not been worried by following in the footsteps of the leaders recognised by such a large club, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnesley and Ipsviča.
"My success will now be measured by whether I can return this club to the premiere.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Prime Minister," he said.
"Returning the club's premiere will not be an easy task, but I'm likely to believe that I will only be successful here once this task has been accomplished."
Ross has been in his career for only the third year, acting for some time as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending 15 months in the "Hearts" trainers.
Then he helped the club "Alloa" recover from falling to the third level and during the same season helped "St Mirren" to get the title.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable now than during his player's career in clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamylton Academic".
"They may have been a real crusade," he recalls, taking responsibility over "Alloa".
"I really believed that leadership was my real call — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange because I made good progress, was able to live on it, and I also enjoyed some heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
We have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel this because of work-related stress and pressure, but my management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the basket is 5.30 a.m. Saturday evening.
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular pubs to compete, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that in July the sales of pubs and bars had increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, representing the business advisory agency CGA, who collected data, said: "Incessantly sunny time and England's long-standing participation in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June: the surplus of the pubs had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants experienced a drop.
Restaurants, which dropped by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in the drink pubs and bars was the most grateful, as they experienced a much greater upturn than the restaurants experienced a downfall.
Food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars the monthly sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, while food sales decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of RSM recreation and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of extensive social or sporting events are the main factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the additional constant cost pressure.
In the case of food providers, long and hot summer could not come even more inappropriately, and time will show whether the moderate temperature that we usually experience in August will provide the much needed relief."
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decrease in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s supervisor of sales of pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover exceeding GBP 9 billion and has incorporated the industry criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that he or she hides from his or her parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of false profiles is growing rapidly on the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a "clean key" account to show to parents and also private accounts.
A mother who found her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11-18 had two profiles, and only half of them admitted maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers make up online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilida Doila will be a "light voice" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as Director without executive powers at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doila is Scotland's most prized space and outdoor show, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to use her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"A great deal of respect is paid to Eilida throughout the Scottish, United Kingdom and world-wide community of athletics, and we are convinced that Scottish athletes will gain an enormous amount of involvement in their board of directors," said Betty.
Doila said, "I want to act as a "light voice" and I hope I can really get involved and help lead this sport in Scotland."
An American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, thus obtaining four Olympic gold medals, and currently has a regular BBC pandemic, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't pass.
The doctors said that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I can do my exercise!
Thank you for your inspiring words!"
Opinions shared on breast milk pump advertising comparing mothers to cows
The breast-milk pump company has taken care of shared online views in the context of advertising, which compares feeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first silent breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company "Elvie" released an advertising of a sticky bell to demonstrate the freedom offered to breastfeeding mothers by the new pump.
Four true mothers dance in a wall-filled cattle house at a song that says, "Yes, I pluck myself out, but you don't see any tails" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The song goes on: "Eject, exhaust, I feed the babies, exhaust, extract, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has called for a wide online resonance.
The 77 000 times and hundreds of times video comments have received shared feedback from the viewers, and many say that this highlights the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very wrong decision to use cows to promote the product.
Just like us, they also have to become tough and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump unobtrusively belongs to breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to promote a breast milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
It also said: "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended advertising, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was "excitesome".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I'd still breast-feed.
The sucking of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I understood the idea.
This is a genius product," wrote one.
Another comment states: "It is a fun advertising for mothers who milk (unlike in workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "cow".
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertising, a group of women found that they all danced with inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that many women who lick milk claim to feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and it is unobtrusively part of the breast for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing attention to milk milk milk in parallel with the milk-draining women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk milk milking, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the shocking sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the "Elvie pump" pump has come to the centre of attention.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue at Marta Jakubowski’s show using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been displaced quietly to a tent town near the Texas border
The number of children detained has increased rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively as high as before, and has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration, which have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
As a rule, the majority of sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that if they openly apply to take up a child, this would threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and these data would also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, senior executive of immigration and customs law enforcement, showed that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship for unaccompanied minors before the convention.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been punished.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors stay illegally here, and much of them are criminal aliens.
We therefore continue to pursue such persons," said Mr Albens.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to come to court already within one month after the detention, rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard provided.
Many will use the possibility of a videoconferencing call instead of coming personally to defend their legal status before a judge in immigration matters.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be removed quickly.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, have been reported according to information and evidence from asylum workers recovered from the system in recent months.
The lawyers claimed that these concerns would be exacerbated by larger objects such as Tornillo, where the signs of child suffering are more often overlooked because of their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town, not taking enough time to prepare them emotionally, or allowing them to say goodbye to friends, could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the U.S., French and Turkish Occupants to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that the war in the country is already over the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are in Syria illegally, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and 'it will be addressed accordingly'.
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, 'the war on terrorism is almost over'.
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", both from both terrorist groups and from "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurd forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
As regards the issue of refugees, Mualem declared that the circumstances were great for them to return and blamed "separate Western countries" for the "predominant fear of spreading" because refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for reconstruction before an agreement is reached between the Asad and the opposition on the end of the war.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone under the last support of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack on a province of three million people by the Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has certain deadlines", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda related group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committees, consisting of representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop the post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to the "revision of existing constitutional clauses" and warning of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for the second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps many liberal observers, an impeachment and a scandal prematurely put an end to his Presidency.
And then, 'it will be the most dramatic end of the Presidency all the time!'
At present, there is nothing to show that observers are relaxing.
Since 2014, the ratings have more than doubled during the most favourable CNN broadcast, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News sees 2.4 million viewers at the most favourable time of transmission, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, reports Nielsen, whereas MSNBC "The Rachel Madow Show" (Reicella Medova Show) is the highest ranking cable TV with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the pillar of the ABC drama "Designed Survival".
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Holywood Boys Club has its own theory.
She remembers the taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote in favour of Mr. Tramp.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "Because he's smiling me," said Miss Scovelle.
Haos is entertaining to some extent.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV, news from Washington could determine what is going to happen with the Rou versus Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that can only be affordable by the most privileged observers.
And yet it's more than being informed to a citizen when at six o'clock, watch a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15 thousand-dollar bomber-type jacket from ostrich feathers and leather ("the suit from which arrogance sucks," declared "Washington Post") and what role will be played by Stormy Daniels to describe the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never take Super Mario again as before.
"A part of what he does that gives the impression of reality show is that he has given you information every day," Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" show explained the variable team and daily turns of the tram show (the Chinese with the praise of N.F.L., Kim Chen).
You cannot afford to miss at least one episode, otherwise you will lag behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss that week, time on the North Coast of Kaunas was sunny,80 degrees (~27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in a room where he watched MSNBC broadcast without looking at it, while recording CNN.
He was unable to stand back, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand in front of the Senate Committee on Justice and his future in the Supreme Court threatens to collapse.
"I remember the times when we made all these crazy shows and when people said that "it's the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from outside flows into the pre-election campaigns of the most ambitious parliamentary interim elections
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress District of Pennsylvania is seeking money through the transformation of the Congress Areas, which will result in two present Members fighting for one place.
This recently redesigned outskirts of Pittsburgh is linked to the representative of the Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections last spring in another area.
The lemb will fight with another existing Member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former area 12 of Pennsylvania, which overlaps to a large extent with the new area 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of Republicans, the maps were processed.
Competition in the new area 17 has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Committee (Democratic Campaign Congress Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
The lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely observed March elections in the 18th Congress.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Political experts give the democrats a small majority.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese support, but then considered
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with Mr. Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners placed the management team of the Trampa organization behind the door.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, justifying this "a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan", its representative, Heather Nauert, stated in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received around 140 million American amounts in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support, was considered to be subject to penalties.
The proposed penalties, which would include the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country where unemployment and murders have reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an approach to preventing migrants from moving to the US.
In mid-September, the State's senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially by putting an end to the penalties imposed on El Salvador.
The diplomats were informed that Vice President Mika Pence has now decided to participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October to show how serious the administration is for emphasising the meeting.
And three American ambassadors silently returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide more information on the debate which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult the internal negotiations if their anonymity was to be maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying history
The second stone garden could include a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trampa may have hindered justice, which has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is said that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the trampa campaign has co-operated secretly with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the second party wins the Congress, Tramp will have to respond to this structure and perhaps also to his peer jury right when he is going to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of "but", and I do not claim that the fall of Trampa is inevitable or that it will happen to his associates in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the battle.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid years of bloodbath.
History is turning around these turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trampa releases General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been hard to deal with since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record the conversation with the President and thought about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' story is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the requested FBI investigation about Britta Caveno will not be complete or honest or if he will be approved for the post of judge of the Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and credible accusations of sexual attack?
And what is most important, will we vote in the interim elections to the Congress, which will call Trump to account?
If we do not meet all these challenges, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed in referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was sent to Auschwitz by exactly the same Nazi regime that once existed in my office.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with swastic.
How am I not optimistic about our future if I have such an inheritance?"

"Rangers" star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the fight against Vienna's "Rapid"
Rangers will welcome Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive uncharted game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League's G Group.
The road trauma prevented Gram Dorans, an attacker of the center, from taking part in the season's games again until the undrawing result of 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this because "Villarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to play, believing that we would be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but the whole thing is a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we untie in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game because they have achieved a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
Last year with all my injuries and changes in the club itself was clearly difficult, but now you can see new things that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the workout is good.
I hope we will be able to continue the fight, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents knew clearly what kind of care they wanted, few had discussed the matter with family members.
About half of the individuals in a national study indicated that they do not talk to a spouse's friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be taken care of by family members, but do nothing to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse’s friend and your children. You cannot prepare your family for the need for care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with the sum of money to cover these costs, or provision of your property, the most important thing for you to have money.
Develop your legal documents. Avoid legal struggles before they start.
Talk to your health representative so that you have a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals act as you wish if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of allocating financial powers.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will make sure that your invoices are paid if you cannot do so by yourself.
And don’t forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency assistance.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan so that this situation does not surprise you.
"And this is not just about finances, but also about who is a doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan is drawn up."

The 40 - year - old victim was in the Oxford Grove, Devona, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen, and the palm.
The police described the shooting of BST around 2.30 a.m. as "random".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life, and the police invite the Witnesses to apply.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, has killed at least 384 people, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to the destruction of communications, rescuers have been unable to obtain any information from the Dongal district, located north of Pala, near the epicentre of the 7.5-magnith earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated following a devastating natural disaster in Palas.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi and is located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area approximately 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west coast of the island of Sulavesi.
In 2017, it is estimated that 299 200 people were living in an area forming part of the province.
Fisheries and farming are the economic pillars of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the other side of Morovali, Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Pala and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The tsunami also fell over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regularly formed.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami on 26 December affecting 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias (Nia) off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnithodus severe earthquake broke out in the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated islands, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7,6 Magnithu earthquake erupted near the city of Tiranga, the capital of the province of the West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnithu earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing waves of tsunamis up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake close to the ground struck Pidie Jaya's area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as it reminded of the destruction brought with it by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not develop, but more than 100 people were killed by the rotten buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.

Federal prosecutors want to demand the use of the rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of Saijfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to the claim, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to attack the West Side Highway road in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit the pedestrians and the cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims with intent and caused a serious injury, as stated in the notification of his intention to impose the death penalty before the South District Court in New York.
According to the court's document, both these charges could lead to the death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury adopted an indictment on the prosecution of Saipov in 22 charges involving eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an indictment of cruelty and damage to motorised vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", explained the prosecutors, saying that the attack by Saipov was "honorous, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevels, Anna-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hern Ferruch, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco," states a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the South District Court of New York were charged with executions.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but in 2009 he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last executed in New York’s federal case, in 1953, by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death after being accused of being involved in spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The death penalty on the electric chair was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, during the days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the officials that he was inspired to attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also informed him that he had requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sipov, said that he was "slightly naturally dissatisfied" with the charge.
"We believe that the intention to claim the death penalty instead of accepting the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all parties involved," Patons explained.
In the past, Saipov's defense team has called on prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Conservative states that Mr Brexitas should be entrusted with the management of the negotiations to Mr Farate
Nigel Faraž promised today to mobilise the People's Army at a conservative conference.
The former British Independent Party leader stated that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of the Members of the House of the House of Teresa Mejas suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone announced to the route in Birmingham that Britain would have left if Mr. Faraž was Minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs Mejas will have to face in trying to unify her controversial party was demonstrated by Conservatives who supported the EU and joined a separate city protest against Brexita.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain her compromise plan on future relations between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise), and is experiencing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The members insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her offer and "haos".
Mr. Bone's Leave Means Leave, at Solihull, said that he wanted to throw away the Maya Plan in the dung.
He suggested making Mr Faraž an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the point of saying, we would have already quit," boun announced.
Mr Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexita, but we must throw away the Maya Plan'.
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to have a cuff!
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country!"
Mr Boun ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false'.
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexit, also took part in the march, and told the reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers Plan is not popular with society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In Maya's report, she added, "The Prime Ministers remain in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians at the summit must feel under pressure if they intend to ignore the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexita and we're here today to tell them we're not gonna let them do it."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd of people, he fills: 'I want you to let our politicians who intend to hand over Brexita feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexita, and we will never relax until we achieve an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the survivors walked through Birmingham before a two - hour meeting took place in the city center.
Inquisitive activists greeted conservatives against Brexita banners after a group meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers' Party, ridiculed the Conservatives on the security issues they experienced with the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who say to us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, as yet, the whole border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Brekst," he added.
Warena plans to carefully consider the nomination of the President of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will "consider" the election of the US President after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Democrat of Massachusett spoke of her future in the city hall of Western Massachusett.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetel
Since Walter Bottz qualified on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team's work would play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left the Hamilton dry, defending his place on the first two trips and inviting Fette to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to enter the garage and left him at the vanguard to deal with the rest, which was probably decisive.
Mercedes's pilot filled the circle later and fell behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to stand up as a leader after a balance of forces, which saw Ferrari's driver persistently leave behind, risking falling behind after a double manevre to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was leading a large part of the race because he focused on tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen's fourth.
After all, he arrived in the garage on the 44th of April, but he was unable to increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds because Raiconen remained the fourth.
This is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," he said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein for her perseverance in her letter from Christine Bleisy Ford, in which she accused the candidate for sexual harassment from the Supreme Court, Britta Kaveno.
Speaking at the headquarters in West Virginia, the President did not specifically talk about the Ford's testimony to the Legal Commission of the Senate, but made a comment that what happened to the Senate shows that people there are "wrong, unkind and unreliable".
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that already happens in recent days in the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, bad, unkind and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you flood the document?-- "Oh, what did you do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the Senator's intonation.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail what Ford accused Caveno of indicting, and at the beginning of September, the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denies that this would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I "not flooded" her story," Feinstein said to the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it."
But her denial did not like the President, who commented on the situation on Saturday evening: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
"They are purposeful to regain power by any means."
Do you see evil, unkindness, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy to gain power and control," the President says, "Mediaite."

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised for being a hero after he sacrificed himself to make a flight with hundreds of passengers safely take off from land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a severe earthquake on Friday rocked the island of Sulavesi, causing a tsunami.
The area continues to suffer from severe subfluxes and many are trapped in mud in the city of Palas.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was a strong swing.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would safely take off.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
An Indonesian air navigation representative, Johannes Sirait, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to bring him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're really upset when we hear it," he fills.
In the meantime, public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the State Disaster Prevention Agency claims that access to Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that it will grow beautifully, because many more people's bodies are under the ruins, as well as many people cannot access it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the agency.
The Vilnius city, which is 6 feet [6 m] high, destroyed Pala, where a mass funeral would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, Sky News said: "Emergency medical services bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is a deficit.
The small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Galfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived at Pala and said to the military of the country: "I ask you to work day and night to perform all tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
This year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lomboca, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft Disaster in Micronesia: Now Air Newgini says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight, during which it fell into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people had disappeared, although it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
The airline Air Newgini announced at the press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not answer for one of the passengers – a man.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local people helped save other passengers and crew by boat after the plane fell into the water trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials, on Friday, said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, all of them in a stable position.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the runway length was overestimated on board.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Jane.
Jane says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the ditching plane using emergency exits because the water was only to the waist.
He said that he fell into panic and shouted and that he had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy sailors, who worked nearby to improve the ship’s berth, also helped to rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people to the shore before the plane sinked about 30 metres (100 feet) under the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG's registered airlines over the last twenty years, no one is related to Air Newgini.
The psychoanalysis commentator explains the events at night during which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge provided evidence in a repeated case, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, commentator of the psychoanalysis of the U.S. Department of Judicial Expertise, pointed out for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the information from the phone to put together how the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Telis and the 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rowlet said that he had received location data from several phones, indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his earlier testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
On Saturday in the courtroom, Sanford showed that he was not in the city that day.
When the charge asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my car was in Nashville."
Another coincidence was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that a little after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted the messages, calls and contact information received from Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted him from his life," said Heil.
The defences are expected to provide their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be passed to the jury later on the same day.

Black again?
In New York, the nanny has sued a couple for dismissal after receiving "racist" information
In New York, the nanny has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong text message from the mother who complained that the nanny was "re-black."
The couple deny that they would be racists like a trial for "extortion".
Lindsija Plasco-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her disapproving attitude when she learned that the new child care provider, Gizele Mauries, is black when she arrived at work on the first day of 2016.
"NEXT, DEPENDENT, BLOOD," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message to Maurice, not her husband, but twice.
Having discovered her insanity, Plasco-Flaxman's discount on Maurice, saying that their former African-American baby girl had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for a Filipino, referring to New York Post.
Mauriza paid for her one working day and sent her home with Uber.
Now Mauriza has sued her for dismissal and wants to receive 350 dollars a day for six months for her job with a secure life, which she originally applied for, and without an employment contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said on Friday, "post", adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the cessation of Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was accused.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, man, said "post."
"But, would you entrust your children to someone you treated harshly, even if it was just because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
When the court sitting was treated as "extortion", Plasko said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a very "complicated situation".
"You really are against someone this way?
This is not acceptable," the investment banker added.
As long as justice is still ongoing, public opinion is quickly heard in court across social networks, disdaining them about their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put yourself into the shoes" of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was released.
It is very surprising now to learn what we know about Paddington's great success."
Having said that her father, who had worked as an operator in the BBC before felt inspired to write a book for children on a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet bitter" after father's death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who is called "a very important family member", her father was quietly proud of her possible success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and wasn't great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was just like if you have a child who achieves something: you are proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone
After landing her daughter with the quick ones, she was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said that it was very bad and that she would not be expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying she'll die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowed down and left her body behind.
She would have died even faster, and it all ended now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t sing or scream because I was in a situation of family and people around me.
I needed a lot of strength to control."
After all, then already the loss of the daughter, Ednan-Laperuz, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Sliding women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who have committed suicide by loved ones act to help others keep their lives alive.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphrey strengthen cards at the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davies’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydny, said that her son was a promising cook with a smile of addiction.
"Everyone recognized him with a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "enlightened" always and everywhere."
But he gave up work before he died, because he was "very, very dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davies said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Davis created cards "to tell you that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence -- you have to talk."
Hamphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he would feel sad or that he would be depressed or that he would feel anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a great trauma to children, but they have to deal with it: "It irritates the whole family.
That's the difference between us.
But we must all continue and fight."

The future of Britta Caveno hangs in the air because FBI launches investigation
"I think that if we could really get what he demands - in terms of time and scope of the investigation - we could reach a small consensus," Fleik said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission "shares" between fortified partisans.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republic not want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint is just a coincidence.
The inter-elections are five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to go badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves to the highest court.
George V. Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Capeno, who worked at the White House during the Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats belong to the Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Capeno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice-President, to decide on the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "reduced" number of North Korea's political asylum seekers
North Korea's number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Uniting of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers compared to 2011, when they were 2706.
Park said that tighter border controls were the main factors behind North Korea and China and the high rates of human traffickers.
No public comments from Pyongyang have been received.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them in a forced manner.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically wary, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when they agreed to cooperate in large trains to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since these negotiations.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be unilaterally armed first," said Ri in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Caveno "histeric" and claims that he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court’s minority leader Nancy Pelosi named the candidate of the Supreme Court Breta Caveno "histeric" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi gave comments during the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "histeric," said Pelosi about his reaction to the evidence provided by Caveno on Thursday to the Senate Judicial Commission.
Capeno was emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blewis Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Capeno was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and chastising, talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the democrats on the Commission who were accused of 'grotesque and concerted destruction' by the liberals, who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost his office in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that she believes that Capeno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think that he himself disqualifies with such statements and attitude as he addresses Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked whether she would try to question Caveno if she had been approved and if the Democrats had obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he's not suitable for the post not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace court," said Pelosi.
Capeno, now, is a judge at the Washington County Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about the possibility that Caveno takes decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe V. V. V., because she is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Capeno went around questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical and double-comfort man to work in court, but we'd expect that we'd be happy to say, "Is it not wonderful?" said Pelosi.
But women have to hold on to themselves.
It's a denuncia, months and years, everything has accumulated "over the edges," but she's not allowed to get it all out of her way crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once upon a time, a woman who was the manager of a company, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique — when she became angry and began to cry, she told the person she talked to: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are only partially recognised as an anger discharge because they are misunderstood in the very basics.
One of my most striking memories is that of the oldest work, where the proportion of men was expressed, when I once cried out because of my irresistible anger, when an older woman — a self - control driver (a woman) grabbed me behind my back.
"Never let them see that weep!" she told me.
"They don't know you're over.
They think you're upset and they're just going to be happy that they managed to get you under your skin."
Patricia Schroeder, then US Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his election campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in the extramarital relationship, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and withdrew from the elections, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she could not stand as President.
"That wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted me to come up with.
There were some who called it "Snow White and Seven Throat."
She took part late in the campaign, delayed the collection of funds and promised that she would not participate in the elections unless USD 2 million were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her men’s donors donated $1,000 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she said in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and talk to voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "suffered".
"You'd think I had a nerve breakdown," said Schroedere.
"You'd think Cleanex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're gonna write on my tombstone.
"She cried."
Why the US-China trade war can be favorable to Beijing
The main excuses for the opening of the trade war between the US and China are hidden, and while the fight is not over, differences between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth USD 200 billion (GB15 billion) and immediately taxing half of the goods exported from China to the United States.
Beijing also responds "wently" every time, the youngest is five to ten percent rates for $60 billion of American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to replying to the US alone and that it is questionable that the world's second largest economy could be alarmed in the near future.
In order for Washington to resign, certain demands should be accepted, but public clandestine in the US would be too shameful to the Chinese President Xi Siji Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision has been made, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than previously recognised by observers," said Abigeil Grace, a researcher at New American Security focusing on Asia.
Syria is a "ready" for the return of refugees, said the Foreign Minister.
Syria states that it is ready to voluntarily readmit refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been hit by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorism in their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept help in the reconstruction of the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the uprising.
European golf team sensationally wins the Raider Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raidera Cup, overcoming the U.S. selection with a score of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when a team led by a random Danishman, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points that were needed to beat the US sample.
The U.S. star, Phil Mikeelson, who was hard to go through the entire tournament, put his T-cock in the water at PAR 3's 16th hole, sticking to the match of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to get a result of 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the current format.
American Jordan Spit with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, by ranking the lowest player Torbjorne Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, who was probably the last Raider Cup.
Eight Raidera Cup Veteran, a Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player of the tournament all the time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't control tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am truly grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cup.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad that I could help," said Garcia emotionally after the victory of the European team.
He goes on to give his compatriot John Ram, who won U.S. golf legend Tyger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 singles.
"The pride I felt when I won Taiger Woods, I grew up following this player," said 23-year-old young Rams.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raidera Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 top golf tournaments, while second behind Jack Nüll.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their opportunities, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf for the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furik of the U.S. team said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players took a very good game.
We are going to restructure, I am going to work with the American PGA and US Rayder Cup Committee and we are going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to tap your hats.
We were won."
Latest news about red tides: Concentration decreases in Pinella, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Committee on Fish and Wild Fauna in Florida (FWC) points to an overall reduction in the concentration of red tides in part of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, flowering spots have been reported in Pinella, Manati, Sarasot, Charlotte, and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The flowering of the red tide stretches about 130 miles from the sea coast of the area of North Philippinela to Southle.
The plans can be found about 10 miles from the Hillsborough coastal area, but in some places they last for about a week.
The red tide is also covered in the Paso area.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in the Pinella area or its coastal area, low to high concentrations in the Hilsboro area coastal area, low to high concentrations in the Manati area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasot area or its coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or its coastal area, and low concentrations in the Kohlje area.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in the areas of Pinela, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Coley.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in the north-west Florida last week.
