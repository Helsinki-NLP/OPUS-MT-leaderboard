The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “shows like dolls”
Some members of the Assembly ruled on the proposal to change their name to MWP (as a member of the Wales Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly in the Wales Parliament.
The Assembly was concerned that this could cause confusion at political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his group was concerned, "because it is concerned with Twp and Pwp."
Not for Wales readers: The Valuuan language “twp” means “a fool”, and “pwp” means “something”.
"Plaid" Assembly member said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered an alternative.
Wells Conservator claimed that his group was "open" as a result of changing the name, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "Blue".
The valuing letter is thought to be similar to that spoken in Yorkshire English, etc.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Wales Government Act gave the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support for the Assembly to call the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but in the course of the public consultation the MWP received its greatest support.
The Assembly's members clearly propose alternative options, but the efforts to reach agreement can be a headache to the Presidency, Ellin Jones, from which it is expected to present legislative proposals on amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of the Assembly member and the committee framework plan.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on how they should be called.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held in order to resolve the dispute over decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, known as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
President Gjogre Ivanov said that the vote would not be respected.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zorana Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During the difficulties of Harlem, the bells of St. Martyn and other churches were silenced
“All the people with whom I spoke said that it was possible to find a bar and church on every corner, ” said Adams.
- You don't find any of them today."
He said that it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
“ Today people communicate differently, ” he said.
- Bars are no longer a neighbourhood site where people are constantly gathered."
When he talks about the churches, he is concerned that the money he obtains when it comes to selling the goods will not be enough, as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they start.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multi-apartment apartments with co-operative apartments, where such people would live without the remaining temples.
"The majority of people who will buy co-operative apartments in these multi-apartment houses will be white," he said, "and therefore the last moment the churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built in 1870 in the Baltic co-regulations, before Harlem became the black metropolis, the metropolis community, and St. Martyn Church was built in the decade later.
The original co-regulation of white methods was set out in the 1930 ’ s.
The black co-regulation, which was organised in the farthest place, took over the name of the building.
St. Martyn's church was taken over by the Black Competition with the clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led the retailer's boycott on the 125th street, the main store in Harlem, where she was refused to employ or appoint a higher position for black people.
In 1939 the building was severely destroyed by fire, but because the parishioners of Johnson, the spiritual father, were planning to restore it, they ordered a kingdom.
The priest David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson, and the heir in the church of St. Martyn, proudly called the poor bells.
The experts who closed the military in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, expert at Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the first in the world to be played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind. 18 years ago he started playing a bigger cartoon at the Riversaid Church.
Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martyn did not change his other musician.
What has happened in the church of St. Martyn in the last few months was a complex story of architects and contractors – some of them were invited to the church worlds and others – the bishop of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristia is a worldwide leader management body, which expressed the bishops' concern in July that the bishops' “will try to pass the costs” to the zacristian, although it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishops lack transparency.
Riley in California damaged the 13th anniversary of the capture of lobster
Officials reported that the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday when he received lobster on the opening day of the lobster harvest season in California.
He was attacked 7 a.m. at Ensinitas near the beach of St.
Chad Hammelis San Diego KSWB-TV wires said he was on Saturday morning diving with friends about half an hour, when he heard the boy calls for help, and then came with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was moved to catch the lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted: “I was bitten!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that he had been robbed of all of his keys.
“I began to cry out of the water to all people, saying: “A shark is flying in the water! ” Hammel added.
The boy was shot on board to a children's hospital in San Diego, Rady, where he was found to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that the boy had attacked is unknown.
The savage captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was observed in that area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injury to the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to cry to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty sections of universal shop-style, which will be worked by specialists.
Having actively engulfed the UK's 2.8 billion pounds ofsterling beauty market, which continues to grow, and fashion and domestic sales of goods fall, the larger beauty units will try 11 shops across the country and, if they achieve success, the next year will be equipped with more shops.
Investment in beauty is growing, and shopping centers are looking for ways to use shelves, sometime for TVs, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty range up to 3 000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more local brands in similar stores like Boots.
The shopping centre also releases its "Boutique" makeup assortment, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop "Fragrance Shop" will test for discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croidon, South London, and the second one will be opened later this year in Sele Ouk, Birmingham.
Because of online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities daily from the local stores of essential goods, shopping centres need to try more to attract people to visit.
"Sainsbury's" CEO Mike Coupe said that the company's sales shops increasingly look like a universal shop, because the supermarket networks are trying to fight sales at cheaper "Aldi" and "Lidl" shops by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has included Arga's outlets in hundreds of shops and has also installed a number of Habitat shops because two years ago it purchased both networks, which claimed to have strengthened the sales of food products and were more profitable.
Previous shopping center attempt to renew your beauty and pharmacy division ended up in failure.
At the beginning of the first decade of this century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up in a dispute on how to distribute income from the shops of pharmacists located in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold GBP 125 million for its drug 281 stores to Celesi, the owner of the "Lloyds Pharmacy" network.
It was argued that Lloyds’ contribution to this plan was accompanied by an extended range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We changed the exterior of beauty sections and the atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be prepared to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and convenient places we are now an attractive beauty place that challenges the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones is "sent" due to the fact that Holly Willoughby ended up with him a GBP 11 million sale
The "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "sewed" after the TV show driver Holly Willoughby ended the sale of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for their home admiration and access to the trademark Trily.
The pair of business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old head of the "This Morning" edition announced that he would leave.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable lifestyle brand for the last minute to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angry Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den.
The sources say that Jones was "sent" when the golden television girl admitted at the headquarters of his business empire, Marloo (Bakingamshire) that, due to new transactions reaching GBP 1.5 million, it will no longer have time to allocate to him the trade mark "Truly" for his household's goods and accessories.
The business was compared with the Goop trademark Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was assumed that it would double the GBP 11 million mark.
Since the 37-year-old Willoughby Instagram account reported that they were leaving Trily, Jones fly from Great Britain to one of his holiday homes.
Source said: “Truly” has so far been one of the most important Holly priorities.
This should have been its long - term future, which lasts for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave all was extremely surprised.
No one could believe what is happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou's headquarters is full of ready-to-sale stock."
Experts believe that the exit of The Morning, one of the most financially successful British stars, can cost the company millions of investments in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and household items, as well as due to delays in starting.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Mr Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Trily with T. Cappu, and 52 years of P. Jones joined as president.
The couples are on holiday together, and Mr Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's share in the TV production company.
H. Willoughby will become the ambassador to the M&S trademark and replace the director of I'm A Celebrity, Anto McPartlin.
The close source of Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We used to talk hard, and we were “in love with that. ”
He laughed at the media criticism of the comment given, which some might regard as "non-president", as well as the fact that the leader of North Korea is so positive.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
A short voice of a curious “newman” said:
"I didn't say anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June had been supported by a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are taking place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a "appropriate response" from the United States on early disarmament from North Korea.
He pointed out that the US is in place of sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The short one expressed a much more optimistic approach in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea, ” he said.
- We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now support this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: this has ended in missile tests, help release hostages and return home to the support of American troops.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to be President, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this locked arena, we will better have about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, pointing to a crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombard earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not in need of aid.
Although more than 10% of the population in Lombard has been deployed, this has not been declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid.
“It has unfortunately been made very clear in many cases that there is no need for international aid, so it’s a bit complicated,” said Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" is preparing a team to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
A representative of the National Disasters Agency, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials appreciated the situation in Pala in order to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not ready for its natural wrath.
Although shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of the tsunami alert Sends to Palais, despite the announced warning, is likely to have resulted in an increase in the number of lives lost.
The best time to travel between many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombarde, which is used to treat the victims of the earthquake, is going to Pala, but it will reach a new site in at least three days.
President Widodo has chosen his election campaign centre for reconstruction of Indonesian infrastructure, and he has generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has not made the administration of Yoko calm, as it will participate again in the elections in the coming years.
He is also under pressure from the continuing stress of sectarians in Indonesia, where majority Muslim members adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes, because Christian and Muslim gangs have fought on the streets using masts, arrows and other simple weapons.

- I saw Kante coming in, I put the ball in one thing and, without thinking too much, I was just kicking."
After the Belgian star, Eden Hazard has been shot for 25 minutes by Chelsea from the first chair's first 1:0.

The study of murder was started after the woman’s body was found this morning in Berkenhed (Mersisaid).
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. at the Louison Muse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people who had seen or heard people on the territory to speak.

I would also like to contact all of us, especially taxi drivers, who could record someone with the video receptioner, and contact us because they can have information that is essential for our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is Berkenhed’s resident and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who know a woman, came to the event location to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigations are still ongoing, as the police have reported that they inform the victim's nearest relatives.

The Statute of the House of Kromvelis strikes the last impact of the dispute between the rewriting of the "historic".
Its removal would be poetic justice for the actions of the Taliban like the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England, under the responsibility of the fanatical Cromwell Puriton followers.
But the Kromvelis Society described the proposal as a "friend" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Kromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current debate on the transfer of statues, Olivier Kromwell’s statue at Westminster’s Palace had necessarily to be a target.
Kromwell did not order or execute the iconoclarism of the English civil wars.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Ham Thorneycrofto has created a wonderful image of Kremwell's attitude in the 19th century and a historical photograph of the figure that many still consider worthy to honor.
Goldsmith, The Sunday Telegraph, said: "Many people, perhaps more numerous than today at the end of the 19th century, Kramwell was considered as a parliamentary defender from external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether it's completely accurate or not, historians have argued so far.
One thing is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed a later development of our people, and Kromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this route.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worth mentioning and honoring."
Snail killer killed a Chinese farmer deadly.
According to local media reports, in the southwest Chinese market, the pig attacked and killed the farmer.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that a dead man whose name was Yuan was found. Due to an artery he was bent on blood and lay next to the pig in the Lupanushian market, Guidjou province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder in Sininge (Chinghay Province, China) prepared to inject vaccines to pigs in the pig.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Junano, he was going to travel to markets for 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found a door open to a nearby pig.
He said that there was a large hump in the pig, whose mouth was covered with blood.
According to the report, the court review confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms shrank a farmer.
“Guiyang Everything News” quotes: “My cousin's legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who indicated his name Wu....
The material filmed by the security camera showed Yuan, who entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday for feeding his pigs.
His body was found in about an hour.
Yuan or his cousin was not dependent on the man’s silver - shaped animal.
The manager of the market reported "Evening News" that the pig had to be locked to stop attacking other people and keep it until the police collect evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to be negotiating for death compensation.
Although few cases of pigs attacking people were reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a holding in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [29 kg] was forced by the Wells farmer to the tractor and pushed until the animal was driven by a wife.
After the pigs were eaten by Oregon’s farmer in 2012, one manitoba farmer “CBC News” told them that pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggressive may have a blood taste.
“They’re just playful.
They like candy, they're very curious... they don't want to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Uragano Rose's "remains" will bring great rain to the US in the south-west
The storm Rose is forecast to weaken by moving through cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring a lot of rain to the whole of North Mexico and the USA in the southwest.
On Sunday from 5:00 a.m., Roza moved at 137 km/h as a uranium category 1 and was 620 km southwest of the Euchenian bribe (Mexico).
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side begins to form a stretched area of low pressure and moves eastward, towards the west coast of the US. Since Rose will approach the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to bring great tropical moisture northwards to the US southwest.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25 centimetres [25 cm] of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, interacting with the nearing low-pressure area, will in the coming days lead to a wide drifting rain to the southwest.
The rain will cause a dangerous sudden flooding, a breakflow, and a potential dwindling in the desert instead of 2,5 to 10 centimetres.
Because of the high tropical moisture content in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, it will fall from 5 to 8 centimetres per hour.
The rains are expected to be between 5 and 8 centimetres in the southwest regions, especially in the large part of Arizona.
The rainy nature of tropicals may result in sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
The storms of tropical storms would be a particularly bad idea to bring to the desert by walking.
The rain cany canyons can turn into a grieving river, and thunderstorm would cause wind and dust.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to the southern part of the Californian coast.
It is likely that more than 1 inch [1 cm] of rainfall could cause a slight flow of scraps, and roads could become slippery.
This would be the first wet season falls in the region.
Some of the tropical rains will start to draw near to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Juta will hit on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there are possible intense temperature fluctuations in all the United States because the Arctic is cool, but the tropical zone will be relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central USA.
The temperature of Kansas Sitis (Missour) and Omaho (Nebraska) differs almost 20 degrees from the temperature of Saint Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
Over the next few days, summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the largest central and eastern part of the United States, from the Great South League to the North-East, a warm October with a wide range of high temperatures of 27 degrees is coming.
In New York, the temperature on Tuesday should rise to 27 degrees, which is an average of about 10 degrees above.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the east of the US will be higher than the average multi-annual temperature for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched a court hearing in Bretto Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people during six television broadcasts on Thursday observed the statements made by the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh, and the accusations made by the woman Christine Blasey Ford against sexual violence in the 1980s.
However, the political deadlock continued by the broadcasters interrupting the regular programmes for the change of Friday's last minute: the Arizona Senator has drawn up an agreement to allow the FBI to carry out a week's investigation into the alleged charges.
Ford the Senate Courts Committee said that it was quite sure that Kavan Augh, who was at the high school party, was punctuating her and tried to wear her clothes.
In a bad witness, Kavanikh said that he was quite sure that he was not.
Nielsen announced on Friday that perhaps more than 20.4 million people were viewing the broadcast.
The company estimated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating the number of people watching TV in the offices.
To explain this, it is an audience of the same size as the football matches or Oskars awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s candidacy, was the first of all networks, when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during the full day hearing.
ABC, with 3,26 million spectators, was second.
Nielsen reported that the CBS received 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, CNN – 2.52 million.
High interest has also remained at the end of the hearing.
The main figure of Friday drama was Flake.
After the publication by the small Republican Office of a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was punctuated on Friday morning of CNN and CBS cameras, when protestors called on him, trying to take him to the hearing of the Court Committee.
The CNN directly filmed it with eyes down when it was flooded by people.
“ I stand here in front of you, ” said one woman.
- Do you think he says the truth to the country?"
He was told: "You have the power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, he added that he would have to say anything more at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later, the cable television and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Committee on Courts voted in favour of Kavan Augh’s candidacy for Senat.
However, Flak said that this would only happen when he knew that the FBI would investigate in the coming week the alleged accusations against the candidate whose investigation had been called upon to commit a democratic minority.
Flake, who had talked to his friend, the democrat Senator, Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to confirm that Kavanaugh would not leave the investigation.
President Trump launched the FBI investigation on suspicions against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister has accused criticism of Brexit
The Prime Minister, Theresa May, charged the newspaper Sunday Times with her plans to leave the critics of the European Union playing a policy with the future of Britain and in order to undermine the national interest.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is attending the Conference of Conservatives' Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In the next interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson further attacked her so-called "Brexit" plan for Great Britain and the EU to charge each other's tariffs, claiming that this was "full absurd".
Wayde's Simso shooting Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson on the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of the executions of the 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Ružo police unit reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and arrested in prison, accused him of second-rank murder.
Officials announced the arrest video of Sims and Simponi, and the police mentioned that Sams had lost his glasses during the battles.
“WAFB” branch of “CBS” reports that the police took the glasses from the event site and found the Symposon DNA on them.
After hearing Sympson, the police reported that he killed Wayde in death.
The lawyer informs that his release security is USD 350 000.
On Friday, the Ministry of Experts of the East Baton Ruža parish published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was shot in the head, moving to the neck.
The section is dedicated to the Labour Group of the Police of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the "Soutern University" police and the residents of the district who have assisted the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked district law enforcement for “cruopty and justice enforcement”.
Sammy was 20 years old.
1.98 meter tall guy grew up in Baton Ruže, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
In the last season, a young man dropped 5,6 points on average during the game and caught a 2.6 ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "blocked" and "shocked".
"It's always thought about it," said Wade.
The volcano extorts the ashes in Mexico
Of the volcano of Popocatepetle, the ashes came to southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to keep away from the volcano, when the increase in the Craster's activity was recorded and gas and ash emissions were recorded in 183 times within 24 hours.
The center has been watching many ruins and earthquakes.
The pictures presented in the social media show a thin layer of ash covered car windscreens in the area of Mexico, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysics noted that 72 km southeast of the capital had increased the activity of the volcano since the earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017 at 7.1.2017.
The volcano, called Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
Before the annual vote on independence, the police tied themselves to catalon separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors were intercepted with the riot police and when thousands joined the demonstrations of the opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote on separation which opposed Catalonia.
The riot police that stopped the female separatists were stunned by eggs and powder paints, which caused the dark cloud of dust on the streets, which is usually filled with tourists.
The police used the sticks to stop the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, the groups singing for independence "Unforgettable, unforgiving" were faced with the Unionist protestors who said, "We live in Spain!"
The local press has reported that 14 people are being treated for minor injuries caused by protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers to be illegal, and which is being sung by catalon separatists who are seeking independence in the region, the tensions remain high.
The majority of voters decided to be independent, but due to a large part of the vote, voters' involvement was low in boycotting people who did not want to separate.
According to the Catalonia authorities, last year, when the police across the region tried to stop voting in the polling district, almost 1 000 people were injured during violent clashes.
On Friday night, an independent group set up a camp to prevent demonstration supporting the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer certain about Catalonia's independence perspective.
“ Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I observed the parents cry out joyfully to vote, but we are now trapped," he said.
Despite the fact that in December last year the victory was taken out of regional elections of vital importance and hard to achieve, Catalonia's independence parties were hard to keep pace with the fact that many of their most well-known leaders had taken up voluntary exile or were detained and awaited the court for its role in organising the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puiga, who had filmed the protest on his phone, claimed that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Orioli Juncker, one of the nine Catholic leaders in detention in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The temptation in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the deterioration and repression of democratic values demonstrated by the Spanish Government," he said.

Coin impact secured the Livingston victory of 1:0 against Rangers
The first victory of the Livingston player Dolly Menga guaranteed victory
Livingston, transferred to the upper league, was surprised by Rangers, making Steven Gerrard, the manager of Ibrox club, loses the second of 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's shock turned out to be very important, because the Gary Holto team compared it with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team in this Premium League season remains in trouble and will meet the leaders of Hararts next Sunday, from which they are behind eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the "Rangers" European League matches will play with Vienna "Rapid".
At that time Livingston extended his unparalleled series of matches to six, and chief coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, because Kenny Miller has only changed last month.
Livingston will miss the chance of a match with a Orthodox guests
The Holt team had to be in the front of it long before he took the victory, due to his perseverance, which raises various problems of Rangers.
At first Scott Robinson broke out and hit the cross of the gate, later Alan Lithgow was not able to reach the head of the craig Halkett passed by the ball and he matured near the gate.
The owners, allowing the Rangers to play ahead, were not moved because they knew that they could make their guests trouble creating standard positions.
That is exactly what a decisive victory has been put in.
“Rangers” had missed the free blow and “Livingston” started to cry ahead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson together took the ball from the middle of the penalty.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by “Rangers”, but the defence of the hosts has been insurmountable and the owner Liam Kelly has hardly been working.
Such a thief continued the game in the second chair, although Kelly had to work to back the attack of Alfredo Morelos on the gate.
Scott Pittman's shot was shot by Allan McGregor and, after another Livingston's standard position, the Lithgow hit the ball ran near the gate.
When the ball was transferred, the Livingston was constantly found in the penalty lot, but each time the penalty was imposed, and the two requirements were not satisfied with Glenn Middleton, one because of the Halkett’s collision with the post-change site, and the other because of the touch of the ball with the hand.
Phenomenal Livingston performance analysis
“BBC Scotland” reporter Alasdair Lamont from “Tony Maði” Arena
The Phenomenal Livingston game and the result.
All of them up to one were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for an ever improving game.
The game style and staff from returning to the highest league have almost changed, but it is appropriate to give great merit to the Holt because when he arrived he lit the team.
He was assisted by many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a wonderfully organized defense, and Menga value Connor Goldson and Joe Worrallo do not lose their attention.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play perfectly under Gerrard, this time they lacked much to reach their level.
They were hit little by decisive blows, and only once went through the defenses of their owners, a certain alarm call to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne was accepted in various ways
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skys when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, when the aim was to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders have argued about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
And Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people meeting in front of a mosque for security, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard by condemning the Erdogan policy and the German Government's decision to accept it in their country.
Different protests show that some German Turks regard it as a hero, while others view it as a dictator.

Uragan Roza is threatening Finix, Las Vegas, Solt Lake City, by its sudden floods (this may be useful for its rough territories)
It is not normal for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is what will probably happen next week, when the storm Roza with his remaining energy will dew during the south-west of the desert and this will lead to a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced to surprise the sudden tides on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, which spread towards south and east Nevada, south-east California and Juta, including Fix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
It is expected that on the late Monday when approaching the rain, Roza will pull himself straight to Fixa.
In Finixe, the National Meteorological Service mentioned that only “the ten tropical cyclones kept their tropical state of storms or tropical depression from a maximum of 322 miles [322 km] from Finix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a uranium that is not more than 64 kilometres from the border of Arizona."
When using the latest models of the National Uragan Center, it is predicted that the drop of 5 to 10 centimetres will reach 5 centimetres, and in some places of Arizona Mogolon Rim will reach 5 centimetres.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central caverns and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and some may fall to 10 centimetres [10 cm].
The Rozo rain can be a blessing for people who are not progressing by rapid floods, because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these falls may be useful, as the south-west is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring centre, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very large drought, which corresponds to the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the storm Roza travels to the coast throughout the California Peninsula, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the storm category with a huge wind of 137 km/h, is located 619 km south of the Euchean lake (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/hour.
Auda faces colder waters in the Pacific region and is thus dreadful.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of tropical storm on Monday during lunch or evening.
Legacy falling in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and may pose a serious risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the northwest Sonora is expected to be 8–15 centimetres, but possibly even up to 25 centimetres", reported weather.com.
Next, Rose will travel northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, later on Tuesday morning, to the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday's late evening along Arizona to the South Juta.
‘The main danger expected from Rozo or its residues is a very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the US desert in the south-west’, reported by the National Centre for the Urgans.
These rains are thought to cause life-threatening sudden floods, landslides and landslides in mountain areas.

“Balss for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that we would like to reject an inhumane and offensive tactics of the democratic party,” said Trump in his speech in Viling, Western Virginia.
The short one said that Kavanaugh was in the process of bringing up his candidacy, “he experienced the hates of the democratic party, anger”.

Hundreds of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to grow
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were hurled because of the huge wave of floodwaters, when the severe earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Indonesia.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Pala on Friday, when six meters [6 m] high waved into the coastline, and many of them destroyed and destroyed all that was happening on the road.
After the tsunami, there was an earthquake of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims,” said Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of BNPB Indonesia’s disaster relief agency during the information report in Jakarta.
– The tsunami did not break by itself, he took away cars, logs, houses, he struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho and added that, before blowing the coast, the tsunami at an open sea ran at 800 km/h.
He said that some people climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 Pala centres.
Photographs from the weather of the Stichical Disasters Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bent and ruined bridges, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city continued to be stunned by repeated blows.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported that energy released by the extremely severe earthquake on Friday exceeded 200 times the nuclear bomb cast on Hirostim during the Second World War.
It was reported that the tsunami could have been strengthened because of the geographical location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “high” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and then he added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be larger along the coast, located 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epidemic.
Nugroho said that communication networks “were completely paralyzed, so no information was received” from the Danube.
“There are more than 300 000 people living there,” said the representative of the Red Cross in the statement, adding that employees and volunteers go to areas affected by disasters.
It was said that "this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised without notifying Pala of the tsunami, even though the officials said that the waves had come after the announcement of the alert.
A man on the top floor of the building can hear the fanciful material of social media being shared and shouting about the approaching tsunami below the street.
In a few minutes, the beach is hit by a wall of water carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the film material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted and communication networks around Pala were cut off and the authorities had difficulty in coordinating aid.
The authorities reported that the military from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo planes with emergency equipment, but the person still needs food and other essential items to be evacuated.
The airport was again opened only for the purpose of providing aid and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centres.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Dossaba reported that when the staff from Dongala went safely to Pala, where staff were in the tarpaulin tents built in the office yard, they were accompanied by demolished images on the way.
“They told me when I saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that they had a lot of experience with foreign aid workers were banned from travelling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel can only be helped when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
- When the government says, "Yes, it is a national disaster", we can invite international aid, but this status is not yet published."
The second night after the earthquake of Friday and the tsunami of Pala, friends and relatives of the missing people expected that people loved by them would become part of a miracle that would affect the devastating history of natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled out of the sewerage on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers set free a woman who was pressed under the ruins of her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national parasports team, had learned two of the missing Asian players who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other students were at the Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mandags.
“When I am older in paramedical sport, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon described this message in detail, as in the course of a few hours, following the announcement of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel's collapse, he traveled through the parasparation sports community. He sent letters with the "WhatsApp" app to the Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue crows.
“I think this means that the messages were not received,” he said.
When filling the ATM thefts in the entertainment center “Newport on the Levie” stole USD 26 750
According to a press release by the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning the thief stole USD 26 750 from Bink's employee who filled a ATM in the entertainment center Newport on the Levie.
“The driver of the car has been empty on the ATM in the entertainment complex and is ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote a press release.

Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Having announced the changes in Twitter's account on Saturday, he wrote: "A person previously officially known as Canye West".
For 41 years, West has been called Ye for some time and this name called the eighth album, which was released in June.
The change began before the show "Sturday Night Live" where West was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
In the show he has to replace singer Arian Grande, who cancelled the show for “emotional reasons,” – said the creator of the show.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional title – Mr West has previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
"I think that "you" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and that means "you" in the Bible," said Mr West earlier this year, talking about the name of the album with the radio conductor Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it means us.
This began in Canye, which means the only one, and turned it into just Ye, which means our goodness, evil, confusion, reflection of everything.
Albums better reflect what we are."
He is one of many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the names of the preferred Love and the Blue Love.
The former West's colleague, JAY-Z, also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexican policy Andrés Manuel López Obrador (short cut AMLO) promises not to use civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use the military force against the civilian population when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students is approaching.
López Obrador promised on Saturday that "Taltelolco should not use military forces in order to tame the Mexican population".
On 2 October 1968, at the time of the beginning of left-wing student movements throughout Latin America, representatives of the armed forces shot in a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador solemnly promised support for young Mexicans every month by subsidising students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of education opportunities involved young people in criminal groups.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field,” says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received after various US government bodies published reports of artificial intelligence, even the fact that the US does not have an overall formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The advanced budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and expected in the field of artificial intelligence of another breakthrough," said Lee.
Duplicated funding could double the likelihood that the other great achievement of artificial intelligence would be in the US, as Lee said in an interview this week, CNBC.
Lee, whose book “The Superstates of Physical Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, investing in one of the leading Chinese artificial intelligence companies “Face ++”.
In the 1980s he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the highest-ranking American Othello player and later was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged earlier technology competitions of the US Government, such as the “Robotic Challenge” of the Defence Agency for Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the other would be, in order to help find more insights.
Lee said that US scientists often have difficulty trying to win government grants.
“This isn’t China taking academic leaders away – it’s companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to step up efforts for artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Foundation finances academic institutions people, just like the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations spend money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Department established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from the industrial and academic community, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be set up.
This month, DARPA (the Defence Agency for Advanced Research Projects) announced an investment of around USD 2 billion for AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, in the coming months nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The Macedonians voted in a Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country in the name of the Republic of North Macedonia, an act resolving a dispute with Greece over decades, which blocked its intention to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour refers to claims to the territory of Greece and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but the opponents nationalists claim that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the most famous people in Macedonia.
President Gjogre Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter's activity would reach a minimum of 50% necessary for the referendum to enter into force.
The question of the referendum was raised on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU in agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the replacement of the name, including Prime Minister Zorana Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that would be affected by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying a price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I am here to vote in favour of the future of the country, the young Macedonian people to be able to live freely, are protected by the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although there is no legal obligation, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will bear the result of the vote and that they will be decisive.
A replacement of two thirds of the majority would be necessary.
The National Electoral Commission has announced that no reports of violations have been made before 13:00.
However, voters' activity reached only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjee Tanevski, 62 years of age-oldster Skopje.
Mr Zoran Zaeva, his wife, Zorica and son Duškas vote in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name in order to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov worked out a small scene in front of the tents that he built a boycotting referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised rather than enter the service door,” said Kavadarkov.
- We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaves says that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investments.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaves spoke with his voice.
He said that "Yes" would be the result of "ensuring our future".
According to the results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, 30-43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
According to another survey carried out by Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said 'Yes' votes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, 50 percent of voters must participate in it plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Western government policy since it took over the power last May.
Look at: "Manchester City" player Sergio Aguero overcomes the entire "Brighton" defense and profit power
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterlingo overcome the “Brighton” defense, and the “Manchester City” team on Saturday played at “Etihad” stadium in Manchester, England, achieved a winning result of 2:0.
Aguer's 65-minute wrestling, look, incredibly easy.
Argentinan attacker of the ball in the middle of the square got to attack at the beginning of the attack.
Before he got out to the open field, he went between the three defenders of Brighton.
Then four gamers wearing green shirts surrounded by Aguero.
He set up one defender before he passed over several others to the edge of the "Brighton" penalty.
Then put the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English attacker returned the ball Aguero from the penalty court and this right-hand impact led the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming Brighton's goalr Matthew Ryan.

Scherzer wants to play friendly match with Rockies
After the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons for reshaping.
The competing Scherzer hopes to overcome Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to stay in play-offs; in the national league West they are going to go one point with Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies, Friday evening result 5:2 overcome by Nationals, at least guaranteed the chance to get a preferential road page, but will still have to try to ensure the right to play in the first division.
“Even though we play for nothing, we can at least run to the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will gather, will probably be on the highest level that we will be able to achieve this year.
Why don't you talk?"
Sunday's team's startup composition "Nationals" has not yet announced, but in this case they throw a ball is clearly inclined to release a Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will have 34th of the game in the building, has made a welding workout on Thursday and will take the position of the metictor on his usual rest day – Sunday.

A brief speech in Western Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the involvement of Republican voters in the mid-term elections, the President indirectly refers to the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All that we have reached in November will be placed on the instrument.
We have five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I don't run... but I actually run, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he went on: – You see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they are determined to recover authority by any means, see how low it is, as evil.
They don't care what they've hurt, what they've done to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have a mission "to oppose and hinder".
“And you can see this for the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “pricks, disgusting, low predispositions and wrong people.”
He referred to the Senate's Committee of Courts, mentioning the name of the democratic senator Dianne's Feinstein, which resulted in huge innovations for the audience.
‘You remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one – it was a really bad body language – the worst body language of all I've ever seen."
Labourists have lost their opinions.
They do not tolerate openly expressing their opinions
When Momentum activists voted in my local party in favour of distrusting me, they know if it was necessary to observe it.
Finally, I am the last of the Labour MEPs to whom I have been told that I am undesirable, and this is what I have expressed in favour of.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar threats, as she was determined to stand up against anti-Semitism.
For me, the distrust was expressed in criticism of me for not agreeing to Jeremy Corbon.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Newham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "We want a large number of members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings would be productive."
Most of the eight years in which I am a local parliamentist of the Labour Party, on Friday night GC meetings were precisely such.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not so much that the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented.
It is increasingly evident that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began soon after the party's leader was Jeremy, and the colleagues who, as I thought earlier, were similar political views, started to hope that I would turn around 180 degrees and hold opinions that I would never agree with - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly - and no matter what - on social networks, I have tyrada insults that encourage my cancellation, condemns the centre's policy, and says that I am not in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I was lucky much more than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are political.
I admire professionalism and determination by those colleagues who have to keep the body of sexual and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbynas last week said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the same party of opinion, and every "no-trust" procedure or amendment of the electoral system makes this party less and less.
Over the past two years, I have received many suggestions that encourage me not to jump, speak so loud, and then "all will be fine" with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of the Tatcher government, which in the real sense caused my entire school class to collapse, I wanted to win better public services for those most in need – whether as a member of a local council or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one "Nottingham East" should have been surprised by my political views and disagreement with the current leaders in areas.
For those who have encouraged this procedure on Friday, I can say that when a country is going towards Brexit, where households, businesses and public services suffer, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, one message that I have attainable Momentum addressed to my constituents, members of the Leiborist Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and promise that no threats due to cancellation or political accuracy will hold me to act according to my own beliefs and best interests.

"Ayr"- "Melrose" – 38:17 Inoperable "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two subsequent tests have shocked the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves these moments of triumph in an impressive, promising day-games played by Tennent's Premiership.
The team is now at the top of the table – the only one inoperative.
After their victory, they were given excellent defences and well-tapped opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We have raised all the tests during all the matches to date, and we are still insurmount, so I am really happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr turned out well, players took advantage of their chances better than us."
The Granto Anderson test at the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frasier Climo, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, released by Warriors on the field, allowed the number of Melrose to be collected, and Baggot stopped the negative test.
Climo has increased the advantage of Ayr, when, before and during the middle of the match, he has gained points and has successfully completed a personal test, helping Ayr to undo the result at 17:5.
However, the second chair of Melrose started well, and Patrick Anderson's test, which was successfully completed by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer time because Ruaridha Knott had a severe injury and moved from the outside to the carrier. With the extension of the game, Ayr continued to cry ahead when Stafford McDowallo's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
"Ayr" Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and "Melrose" tried to use the players' surplus, but Bruce Colvine's attempt was not successful at the end of the cool pressure.
The player in the team returned, but, while Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having stopped the Clio without the ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the penalty line for the continuous Ayr crash place.
Climo has successfully completed its test, as has already been done almost since the start of the game renewal, after Kyle Rowe stopped the spring of David Armstrongo into the corner of the square and prevented the local attacker Gregor Henry from carrying out the fifth home team test to earn points.
Still Game star, it seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiertern seems to be ready to move to the accommodation and catering sector, when it turns out that it was appointed Director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man at the popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writing and playing with his long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of this release, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Official data, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun's sources said that Kiern was looking for ways to get involved in Glazgo's "a business of restaurants".
"We belong to the sea": Bollivia, imprisoned on land, expects the court to open its way back to the ocean
The sailors are patrolling at the sea navy headquarters in La Passe.
On public buildings, the ocean's moor has its flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titikaka to Amazon have a slogan: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It's our duty to regain it."
In Bolivia, all over the land, there are still live memories of the access to the ocean that we had to donate to Chile in the 19th century in a bloody conflict because of resources, and it will be alive and long for once again in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes raised over the past decades have now increased considerably, as, after five years of reflection, Bolivia is awaiting the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October.
“Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to achieve positive results,” said Robert Calzadilla, diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will monitor the publication of the TT Decision on the big screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate access to the sea to the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who is waiting for the counter-versusal electoral struggle on re-election, is also very interested in the end of the Monday's decision.
“We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court would take a favourable decision — even if it were accepted — that there would be little change.
The UN authority based in the Netherlands has no power to decelerate Chilen territories and indicated that it will not determine the results of possible negotiations.
The fact that the TJT decision will be published only six months after the last arguments have been heard is unlikely to indicate that the case was ‘not difficult’," said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia was able to make some progress, the past four years could block it back.
"This issue of access to the sea was raised illegally by the current authorities in Bolivia," said Zárate.
She believes that any remains of Chile's good will have been destroyed by a savage Moraleso rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile continue their conversation some time, but after all it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the judgment was taken abnormally quickly.
“Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile era and to terminate the 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never promise to have access to the Pacific”, he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can rely on the US
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho assures that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with its promises, which were agreed by the leaders of the rival countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to renew the diagonal nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu Singapore.
Ri says that the "optimised dream" is that by continuing sanctions and refusing the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean war, North Korea could ever be stunned.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not, first of all, commit convincing acts of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skeptic opinion that Pyongyang does not seriously abandon the arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantor of his security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the soil for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head covers, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable shops
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this tendency is just for you.
The designers Valentine and Thomas Browne in their 2019 spring and summer collections presented a wide range of eccentricly large head covers, and he simply played the viewers of the Paris fashion week in his style.
These extremely impractical hats have conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers introduced eye-catching tracks on the potio.
The distinctive work of Valentine was a huge body - colored hat, decorated with a large, feather - looking edge that encircled the head of the manikin.
Other accessories of non-standard size were gemstones sunken with watermelons, a sailing hat and even anananas – but they were not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browneás also presented a collection of strange masks – at the very same time for Helovin.
Many colorful masks were tied up with lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more of the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a cage suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other was reminded of a melted ice-sleep.
And if you follow this huge trend of fashion – you won't shoot.
Still’s experts predict that these huge coatings can enter the stores.
The big hats were popular with La Bomba tops, and they were already worn by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand, which has created extremely unpractical hats that have conquered all social networks, has released another huge piece on the pot: the strawy beach basket, almost the same size as the manikin wearing a bathing suit.
The red brick-colored raft basket, decorated with rafts in cubes and white leather handle, has become the exclusive accent of the Jacquemus collection La Riviera SS19 during the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Lukes Armitages said in FEMAIL: “I think that the next summer, with huge hats and beach baskets, it’s hard to ignore the need for accessories of a non-standard size.”
John Edward: “Payment of salaries – the most important skill for the citizens of the world”
Scotland’s independent schools improved the record of academic achievements, not to give up in 2018, and once again demonstrated the exceptional results of examinations, which are only further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30 000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their career choices and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the planned school scheme, shows that modern languages remain popular and are eager to meet in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you want to speak to a person in a language that is understandable to him, he will understand you with understanding.
If you talk to him his own speech, you'll talk his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build up relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of recent examinations this year, we can say that the languages are proud of the top of popularity and are characterised by the best maintenance ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of pupils received the highest A rating during the mandarin language exam, 72 percent received the highest A rating in German, as well as 69 percent received the highest A rating in French, and 63 percent received Spanish.
This shows that an independent school in Scotland considers it essential to learn foreign languages as a skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as optional are now seen in independent school programmes and elsewhere as important as key subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers were difficult to fill jobs were insufficient.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly mandatory so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
As future employment opportunities depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses when he teaches a second language, he will in the future be significantly superior to others if he has these skills that are necessary for all his life.
A person who knows several languages will be significantly more competitive in a direct way to communicate with people from abroad.
According to a survey by YuGov in 2013, involving more than 4 000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak the foreign language well enough to participate in the interview, and the French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentage points of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children to invest in language teaching.
Children in several languages, especially in developing countries, will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be many languages from which you can choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create a training environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is unacceptable that, in today's world business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, which must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option for young people in Scotland.
This must be done.

LeBron will start the debut “Lakers” on Sunday at San Diego.
There is little left for the fans to see LeBron James start the season in Los Angeles.
"Lakers" coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play at the Sunday opening competition with Denver's "Nuggets" San Diego.
But for a little bit of a minute in play, it's still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes", said Walton on the official Lakers website.
In the Twitter account of "Lakers" reporter Mikeěas Trudellas said that James is likely to play for a limited period of time.
Soon earlier this week James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during the six preseason matches.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-seasonal matches to get ready," he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his campaign tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Short Languages next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
When voting on the suspension procedure of the candidate for the Supreme Court of his choice, Trump seeks to concentrate support on the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans were threatened with the loss of control during the November vote in Congress.
At one hour this evening, there will be a short talk in Western Virginia and how to watch it online?
The short speech in Vilinge, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in Western Virginia on the Internet in the YouTube broadcast below.
The short one is likely to touch the topic of this week's candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh, because she had a lot of tension over suspicions of inappropriate sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted in favour of suspending the nomination of a candidate until the week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the main purpose of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
The representatives of President Trump's campaign therefore state that the goal of these five meetings next week, as announced by "Reuters", is "to energy volunteers and supporters, seeking to defend and extend the majority of the people who are in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
“Convergence control is so important on his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, as the very hot season begins,” said Trump campaign representative who would not want to disclose his name.
This evening's speech planned at the Wesbanco Arena should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media attention of Pittsberg," says Metro News of Western Virginia.
On Saturday, Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month, a country where it has won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
The short one is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to the polls is in the low rating.
“It is not a good sign to the Morrisey that the President had to come to get him to the top of the ratings,” said Simon Haeder, politicalologist at Western Virginia University, as Reuters reports.
“Rider Cup 2018”: U.S. team has taken the lead and hopes to get to the Sunday team events
After three personal steps on Saturday afternoon, fourverts can be just what needed during this Ryder Cup.
Such a swing of success is completely invented, but players really believe it, especially in competitions such as this.
So what side is a success now?
“They were the first six points, and now four points, so I guess we can keep this in such success,” said Jordan Spietha, preparing the day.
Of course, Europe is the leader, has a four-point victory and still has twelve matches.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, according to Spietech, is disgusting, and they have not lacked it, not to mention the form of Spietech and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and gathered three points out of four.
Spythas was unwieldy from the beginning to the end and impeccablely first.
As the raund continued, these wild victories of victory continued, and Thomas gained two points out of two possible points in order to complete the fourth match in equal form.
His blow, which had won them in this match at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar slogans, which as if said that the end of the American team is not going.
“The only thing you need to concentrate and take care of is your match”, said Spietha.
Now each of these players has been played individually.
To a successful end – 18 wells.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwoods, the history of Ryder Cup is undisputed.
A strange but charming couple of Europe have gathered four points out of four possible and can be calm.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who did not need extra blows not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That turn of events and the reaction of the grieving viewers only confirm that they will be those players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as the Fleetwood or Molinar, who, after the last flashing sunswept the Le Golf National field, have the chance to secure a European victory.
It would be good for both wells to succeed at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubb Watson and Webb Sympson had a short game with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra blow and two double extra blows over the first nine row of pits pushed the Spane and the Swedish into the trouble that they couldn't get out of.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four matches are so interesting to monitor for the interaction between the pairs, for the advice they give and do not give, and for the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe was better played as a team, so with determination it came to the final stage, but this four-stage stage has also shown the fact that the US team has a fight spine, which some, especially in states, had doubts.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup competition, Europe is the leader of 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Ryder Cup competition with a major victory, first before the United States result of a fourth Saturday round 10:6.
A dazzling Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario duo continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard fighting Tiger Woods, and began to take the lead in the four points of Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy that Hazeltine lost two years ago, was dominated in the morning in quarters against the failed American side and completed the outcome 3:1.
The U.S. has demonstrated more resistance in four blocks when won two match, but failed to overcome points of surplus
Part of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 units on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwoods is the first newer in Europe to win four points in a row when, together with Molinari, Molliwood duplicated after the sensacing weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points through their first four match "Rider" Cup in history.
After overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they flawlessly disrupted confidence in the lost Woods and American young Broson Dechambea even better result at 5:4.
Woods, who had just not overcome two Saturday fashions, showed a high level of professionalism at some moments, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his match in four, of them seven in a row.
Justinas Roses in the morning rested and returned to play with partner Henrik Stansons in four; they had a result of 2:1 over 2+1 Dustina Johnson and Broox Koepk, the first and third places in world ranking.
Despite the pleasant, gentle windy day in the south-west part of Paris, Europe did not feel like butter.
Three times, the winner of the Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas put forward an American cartel that won two points on Saturday.
They won the score of 2:1 against the Spanish Jonas Rahm and Ian Poulter, and the fourth match over the score of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3, without having to beat the ball into the first two wells.
Only twice, in the history of Ryder, the team managed to recover four points in a victory to individual match, even though Furyko would have enough equal to keep the trophy.
Although there were two days in the second place, on Sunday, the success seemed to have gone away.
North Korea says that it will in no way dissipate unilaterally without trusting
The Foreign Minister of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen their confidence in the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will not give up a nuclear weapon unilaterally.
The General Assembly of the Rio Yong Ho World Organization has said that North Korea has taken “a remarkable measure of good will” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear test base and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not have a similar response from the US," he regretted.
"With no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way defend the first unilaterally."
As long as Ri repeated the North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to the post-warning attitude towards nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be rewarded during its steps of action, his statement was divided by the fact that he had completely rejected the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim undertook to work on the "Dearmation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking formal end of the 1950-1953 Korean war, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to relax severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even by refusing the declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
“I think that sanctions can be smuggled to us, it’s the same thing for people we don’t care about to play utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump, as underlined by the US leader at the United Nations just earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings over the last five months between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in: "If another country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea, rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such an aligat."
However, the tone of Ri's speech changed dramatically compared to last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that when "the President of Blog" Trump named Kim a "racist gentleman" preparing a suicide mission to direct North Korea's missile to the US was absolutely inevitable.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened "full destruction" of North Korea last year, was praised by the Commission for its courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea meets the requirements for nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, and he said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should pay off Pyongyang for his actions.
However, the US Secretary of State Michel Pomeo to the UN Security Council stated on Thursday that "Sustainable continuation of the Council of Security sanctions without any concessions should be carried out until a complete final nuclear disarmament confirmed by evidence is carried out."
The Security Council supported by all votes the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met at the backs of the Rio General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyan again next month to spray the soil for the next meeting.
This year, Pompeo in North Korea has already visited three times, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he left Pyongyan saying that all the progress was just for North Korea to announce a few hours later that he had made “gangsterical demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and the nuclear complex this month, if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim claimed that those "appropriate measures" that he intended are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the tendency to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to have enough rest
New course at Harvard University this year encouraged all their students to sleep more in order to fight the growing macho culture in studios, taking caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academician found that students at the best university in the world often do not have even basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Briga Sitto, specialist in Women's Hospitals, have prepared a course that, according to him, is the first in this type of United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course visited after a speech about the effects of sleep shortages on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: “Why is it just now, the last year of study? ”
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleeping, and that was what surprised me," he said.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep are helping to achieve academic and sporting results, and to improve general feeling of feeling.
Paul Barreira, director of the Department of Health Services of Harvard Medical School, said that the university decided to propose this course at a time when it turned out that students had a very short sleep per week.
The hourly rate shall include the series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a photo of the common hotel room where students can click coffee cup, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep shortages affect sports performance and how important walking routine is.
In the following section, participants will learn how long-term sleep shortages may increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map of the student town with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We risk that this will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking,” explained Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of not sleeping overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to an increasing problem of sleep shortages.
"To ensure that enough and quality sleep has taken place, students' secret weapon should be used to fight stress, desperation and anxiety," he said, "even by avoiding weight gain, because sleep shortages shift the brain into a hunger regime, so students feel hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old callifornie, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare his course when he attended one of his subjects last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes to him and inspired me to ask the entire student town for a course.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before visiting this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler has recommended students to set up a wake-up device when it is time to go to sleep, just as traveling, and to protect the harmful effects of blue light caused by electronic devices and LED lighting, as they can blow your glittery rhythm out of balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
“Livingston” 1:0 “Rangers”: The Manion of the Manga was saddened by Gerrard's men
“Rangers” experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone managed to overcome the weakened result of Steven Gerrard 1:0.
Ibrox hoped to earn his first victory on the trip after the February triumph result of 4:1 St. Johnstone, but Gary Holto's team was the second time defeated by Gerrard in the 18th match manager's post, and now the team has fallen behind Haarts, the leader of the refugee premieres.
Menga shot seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers players did not see the possibility of smoothing the result.
“Rangers” has now fallen to sixth place, “Livingston” has gone to third place, and there is only one gear behind “Hibernian”.
And the concern of Rangers is not over, because it's probably because of the triple butter thing put the side judge, Calumi Spencez, in his head and hurt him.
Gerrard made four changes that enabled Ayr to pass over and lead to Betfried Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt had confidence in the same convent that took away a point from Hararts last week, and he would have liked how his well thought-out combinations had captured opponents in every step.
“Rangers” was dominant in controlling the ball, but with “Livingston” it did more.
They could be killed already for the second minute when Menga passed the ball by a close blow towards the Hammer Scott Pittman, the gate of Allan McGregor, but the security destroyed his chance of moving the ball away from the gate.
After the remote Keaghhan Jacobs free impact ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his mate defender Alan Lithgow asked by the party.
“Rangers” took control, but the last third of the match was only hope and not faith in their game.
Fifeth minutes later, Alfred Morelosa thought he deserved a fine when faced with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took his complaint to Colombian.
"Rangers" was only able to hit twice in the first chair, but the former "Ibrox" gatekeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by the head of Lassana Coulbaly's impact or by the gentle presence of Ovie Ejaria.
Although "Livi"'s 34-minute goal may not have been in line with the course of the match, no one will argue that they deserve it only for their efforts.
Rangers have failed again to overcome the defence of the viscosity Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his own name and handed the Menga for a easy completion.
During the break Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately gave him fruit when the country’s safety played Morelos, but the impressively thrilled Kelly came down and struck him.
“Livingston” has included guests in the game that I liked – with the faraway transfers of the Lichgow and Halkett ball.
The Holth's team was able to increase its balance at the end, but McGregor was protected from the Jacobs blow after Lithgow's feeding from the corner.
After the change to the square, the performer Glenn Middleton re appealed about the penalty after the collision with Jacobs, but Thomson did not respect him again.
Almanach: Inventor of Gieger Meter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it was 136 years ago and DAUTY... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention that later created a device known as the Geiger Meter.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the scientific world, and later also a hit on popular culture, when the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” has played the cowboys by scientists Royáus Rogers and Daleñas Evans:
Man: “Who the fuck is this? ”
Rogers: “This is the Geger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the way atoms work and touch the radioactive effects in minerals."
Evans: “Hey, now it really shoots! ”
Hans Geger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.

A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognise bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
Then cells can “see” proteins in many forms of cancer and re-inject
The vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
In one woman who has received this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins specific to the HER2 type of cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum”, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells are extracted from patients and are trained to spread to cancer cells, has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukaemia.
Canye West released a short-lived tyrada, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance at the SNL show.
Well, that's not over.
After the unbridled performance of the Saturday Night Live studio, the audience was ashamed of the slogans Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
On that evening, following the third song ‘Gost Town’, which was wearing a hat with the inscription ‘Make America Great’, she continued to condemn the democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“ How many times have I had to talk with the white people, ” they said, “How can Trump likes you, for he is a racist? ”
Well, if racism was to trouble me, I'd been out of America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show started from a comic scene in which Matt Damon laughed from the Bretto Kavanaugh testimony to the Senate Courts Committee on the accusations of improper sexual behaviour by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, the filmed material with West's replicas into social networks was introduced by Komika Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock's trying to make this entry out of West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind his head covering had troubles.
“They mock me in the backstages.
He said he was not going there with such a hat.
They're laughing at me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examer".
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is?
Start to love."
His statements were caused at least twice by the disputing slogans in the audience and the members of the SNL broadcast seemed to be shameful, as Germany reports. One person told the media: “The dead silence in all of the studio was in existence.”
West was invited to urgently change the singer Arian Grande, because her former boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West has confused many with his performance through which she performed song I Love it, wearing Perrier's bottle suit.
He received support from the conservative group, Cance Turner, the leader of TPUSA, who in Twitter's account published a record: "For one man of the most brave spirit: AHY FOR A PASSENGER."
But the chat show manager announced in the Twitter account that West was just “it was himself and it is extremely wonderful”.
“But I choose NEREMTI for a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his “men”, whose beliefs are poisonous ideology that harm my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced in Twitter that the name had changed and that it is now officially known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but went on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega rapper Snoop Doggas was originally called Snoop Lion; the legend of music Princeñas changed his name to the symbol and later became known on behalf of Princess.

The Star of the State Wars Another Harington criticises the distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington became famous as a sword-membrance character John Snau HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages of the Soviet Wars.
But 31-year-old actor criticises the macho hero's stereotype, who claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be firm to be respected.
Speaking of Sunday Times Culture, another said that he felt that "something is wrong" and raised the question of combating the problem of distorted masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Another who recently married her 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie, who admitted that this topic is “strongly touching”.
“I feel that I am now deeply touched by this topic, and where did we make a mistake in raising masculinity?" he asked.
“What do we teach growing men that we are facing such problems? ”
Another considers that, partly because of this distorted wave of masculinity, the television could be responsible because it has very male characters.
He continued: “Who is born, and what is being taught?
What is it taught on TV or on the street that young people believe that they should have such a kind of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how do we change it?
It's obvious that we made a mistake somewhere with young men."
In an interview he also confirmed that he would not participate in any of the “Sosto Wars” prehistorics or continuation, when the series ends next summer, and said that “is already quite a battlefield and horses”.
From November, another film in the modern version of Samo Shepardo Trie West, a film about the film of film director and his brother robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in creating “The Wars of the State”, – he met his wife, Rose.
“In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
"Emy" award won the fantastic series Rose played Igridy, another character, John Snow's love object.
The couple married in June 2018, in Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases of disease
China reports an increase of 14% among citizens with HIV and AIDS infection.
According to health authorities, more than 820 000 people were infected with the infection in the country.
In 2018, alone 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of newly infected people were sexually transmitted, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV-infected people fell almost to zero, as pointed out by representatives of the Chinese health authorities during the conference in the province of Junano.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a sensitive issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized as early as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is widespread.
As the country is dominated by conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men ultimately lead women.
Most of the cases of infection with this disease occur due to inappropriate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as one of the ways to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees have married Republican senator data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the suspicion that one of her employees announced the personal information of the three Republican senators of the USA on the pages of the legislator Wikipedia.
Los Angele's democrat believed that accusations were made by ultra right-wing experts and websites.
“Melas, lies and noxious lies once again”, said Waters in his Twitter account.
The disclosed information also reported that the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Youtha, were home addresses and telephone numbers.
Information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, which was announced by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time when the accusations of improper sexual behaviour were dealt with by Senate to Brettu Kavanaughu, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The affected information appeared a little later when these three senators asked Kavanaughu questions.
The "Conservers' websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState", reported that the IP address at which the source of these records related to the Waters Office was identified and that the information of a member of the Waters staff was disclosed, is reported from the Capitol.
“These unjustified suspicions are totally false and absolute lies,” said Waters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security has been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions is in no way responsible for the loss of this information.
These unjustified suspicions are entirely false and absolute lies."
The Waters statement has soon come under criticism on the Internet, including the press release by the former representative of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” wrote Fleischer.
‘This says that it does not have enough autonomy to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of things he hasn't done, he should not be angry.
He's not supposed to defend.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
It should be calm and humble."
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction with the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday meeting.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who is present at the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts in the Twitter account.
"The truth, if it's not lies," he wrote.
In their statement Waters claimed that its office had informed the relevant authorities and enforcement bodies of these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the organisers are clear, that they have continued, that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone without exception to my employees."
The review of the comedy “Joonis Inglis” again strikes” – breathtaking spy exhibition with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become a search for the clues of "Brexit" in any British film. The same seems to be true of the recovery of "Jonis Inglis" of the action spy comedy, which was started in 2003 and returned to the screens with the comedy "Joonis Inglis" in 2011.
Does this sarcasthy autosat about how we have obviously destroyed will become a new opportunity for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent John Inglis has the second chance of bringing an unpleasant trial to the surface, with a wide eye and a rubber face, which clearly indicates that the name is not for English-speaking cinematographer regions.
Of course, this fool secret agent, who, while having claims to luxury, has acquired some features of inspector Clouseau, a little bit of the similarity between Mr. Binyna's features and the eyelight to that guy, is a hint about which was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also a somewhat based character about the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
There are several beautiful moments in this latest John Inglisch movie.
I liked John Inglic when he came to the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the men's rotor hit his helmet.
The comedy talent of Atkinson is obvious, but the humor itself seems to be breathtaking and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and “Mission Is Not Possible” are boldly inserted into the elements of the comedy.
Humor, as if it were more designed for children than for adults, and the adventures of Johnny Inglis, which I believe, do not seem so inventive and peaceful as the quiet jokes of Atkinson in the play of Mr. Byn.
The most common topic at present is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberbreaker successfully broke into the British ultra-classified spy Internet network and revealed the identities of all the British spies in this area, causing the agent to be disgusted – the extremely insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop of the Prime Minister's, pompous and trapped character's shot in the corner, who is already suffering from the truncating political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May's portrayal of the character, extortion of what he can, but in the script of good material for that little.
Wise counsellors inform her that the identity of all her agents has been disclosed and that she will have to look for people between retired people.
This means that I'm going to have to go to Johnny Inglisch, who is currently a school director in some pedagogic institution, but who is providing illegal training as a secret agent, and there were some good jokes when Ingliš offered a school-type spy Academy of School of Rock.
An Englishman is sent back to Vaithol to discuss the emergency situation, and there he agrees with his longtime general Bough, which Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a man who has been married to a submarine chief, and Vicky Pepperdin, a girl of the highland, seems to be underutilised.
So Batman and Robin, capable of mixing all matters in her Majesty’s secret service, are taking steps again and meet with Olga Kurylenko’s fatal beauty, Ofely Buletova.
The Prime Minister is dangerously screwed up by the charismatic billionaire, claiming that he can solve the problem of British computers, the evil guy Jason Walta, who plays in Jakeas Lacy.
English and Bough start their odysser: dressed waitresses, they cause fire in the French restaurant, causing chaos on a luxury Walta yacht and Inglis start a complete anarchy, trying to take advantage of the virtual reality of headphones to meet the interior of Volta's house.
All the Stoppets were clear to hold this last series, but whatever it is pleasant or wild, all of this reminds children of television.
It's pretty moderate.
How did the British film industry not be able to play the role of Rowan Atkinson, which would certainly be worthy of his talent, as I was talking about other films by John Inglisch?
The Labour Party denies the creation of a plan for British work for four days a week, but to be paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution, giving their employees one day of free time.
This would allow workers to enjoy the three-day weekend and bring the same amount of pay to their home.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's development towards a staff-friendly path.
The transition to four working days week was also welcomed by the Professional Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
One of the sources of the High-Level Labour Party "The Sunday Times" said: "The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but four working days a week corresponds to the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as to the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party has promised the 2017 general election campaign four working days a week.
However, this idea is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The week of four working days is not a party's policy and it is not considered in the party."
John McDonnellis, representative of the shadow government at the Leiborist Party Conference last week, took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the field of the economy.
Mr McDonnellis said that he was determined to regain power from "free dictators" and "profit hunters" in utilities companies.
Such plans by the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all their shares because, after considering the damage they have caused, the Labour Government can deduct something.
It also adopted plans to involve employees on the company's board and to create ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies' capital to employees and to obtain annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond to the question of "60 Minutes" as to whether an FTB investigation can change their opinion
The FTB's investigation into the accusations brought against Judge Brett Kavanaughu led to the delay at least one week in the final vote on whether it was addressed to the Supreme Court, so the question arises as to whether the facts interpreted by the Examination Office could affect the opinion of some Republican senators in such a way that they would not beaborted by this judge.
Scott Pelley, correspondent for the 60 Minute interview on Sunday, asks senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it can happen that the FBI will find out something that will change their opinion.
It seems that Senator Kennedy takes a more free approach than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course", answers Mr Kennedy.
“As I said when I went to the sitting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened when these charges appeared, I called him and asked: “Did you do so?
He answered decisively, firmly, unambiguously."
So Mr Graham's opinion seems to be not to change anyone.
"I have decided on Britta Kavanaugh, there should be really shocking charges," he says.
“On Dr. Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brettt is really disgusting”, added L. Graham, bearing in mind Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one she mentions can confirm that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anyone's gonna find it new."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and aims to eliminate poverty in the world as much as possible.
For the seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message about the actual goal of the event by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival started in 2012. It is a follow-up to the Global Project against Poverty – an international mediation group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (without wishing to buy a paid VIP ticket), visitors to the concert had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering activities, sending an email to the world manager, calling a telephone or in any other way usefully help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the citizens of the world successful in achieving this objective?
Will the idea of paying the people free of charge at the concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called cliktivist, fictitious activism – people believe that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing a record on Twitter.
According to the organisers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters to promote a wide range of objectives.
They claim that, under these actions, world leaders have announced USD 37 billion of commitments and policy strategies to replace more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group referred to 390 commitments and statements triggered by group actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided are already directly affected by almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include the Power of Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and operators in the United Kingdom, which aims to “help children to grow up and discover their full potential”. After more than 4 700 people in the world, Twitter has promised to give Rwanda USD in order to help resolve the problem of malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, supporters, national governments and such as you, World citizens, we can achieve that social injustices such as malnutrition become the past,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the City Power, in London in April 2018.
This group also pointed out that, following 5 000 referrals calling on the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project ‘The power of nutrition’, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website, who asks: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty? ”
The citizens of the world respond: “This is a long and difficult road: sometimes we will break and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and before apartheid, we will be happy because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers who participate in this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hughas Jackman will lead to the event.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use fleet blocks to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to catch Russia's energy access markets, as well as the Middle East markets," said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs of the United States, according to Wassington Examer.
Mr Zinke states that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy field, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe”, said R. Zinke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this by using the fleet, can make sure that the seas are open and can, if necessary, block, make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to those who took part in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit group, which was named the US's 'energy consumer voice'.
In the following, he compared Washington's methods with those of Russia and Iran, and noted that they were essentially the same.
"An economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a higher or lower balance to replace fuel", he said, and he also called Russia a country whose economy is dependent solely on fossil fuels.
These statements have been shown by Mr Trump's administration as part of the mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia in the market, offering European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
So Mr Trump's administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, led Berlin to become a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to Kremlius, the reason for Washington's opposition to this project is purely economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure instrument and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose suppliers”, said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rickas Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was opposed to Germany's reaction and reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with the EU energy policy and bilateral Berlin-Moscow agreements.
“I do not agree with third country interference in our energy supply matters,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ms Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will seriously consider raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential elections.
On Saturday, the Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would consider the question of presidential candidates after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting in Holjok City Hall of Massachusettse E. Warren approved the upcoming possibility to stand as a candidate.
"The year for women to go to Washington to manage our corrupt governments, they must go to the highest place," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election."
At the meeting in the City Hall, Mr Warren went to President Donald Trump, saying that he led the country in an inappropriate direction.
“I am very scared of how Donald Trump behaves with our democracy”, she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his proposed candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Kavanaugh.
The Twitter newspaper, published on Friday, says Mr Warren: “Under the vote, there is a clear need for an FTB study”.
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that most of the voters in the state of Mr Warren themselves believe that she should not be candidates for Presidentship in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Safolk University Political Research Centre and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the expected voters of Massachusetts say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two per cent of her candidacy.
The survey showed that there is more support for former Governor Deval Patrick – 38 percent supports his potential candidate and 48 percent opposes.
Others were discussed as the names of the representatives of the Democratic Party who were nominated for the possible candidate in 2020 – the former vice-president Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
J. Biden says a formal decision will take place in January, as says "Associated Press".
At the meeting of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin spoke of a post-traumatic disorder of Tracko Palino
When Trawck Palin joined the military service in September, he spent his year in Iraq.
On Monday night in the event of an incident of domestic violence, he was arrested and accused.
“I see what my son is experiencing when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families that feel the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder, and some injury to our soldiers, with whom they return,” she said to those who met at the Danube Trump Summit in Tals, Oklahoma.
Mr. Palin called his arrest avertable truth. She said that the son and other war veterans “have come back with a little change, they return to a tougher heart, they are coming back in doubt as to whether they will receive respect for their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other soldiers have given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, in charge of domestic violence and the attack on the woman, as well as in charges that hinder the reporting of domestic violence with a weapon and in the presence of a defiant, as reported by Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Vasil police department.
18 states and Colombia support resistance to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia are in favour of a legal dispute between the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington, 18 states and representatives of this district submitted amicus curiae (judge consultant) comments in support of the asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The applicant’s full name in Greece v Sessions, which was initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says that her partner, "and members of his criminal gang", has been violent about her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The Greek-supported state lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives numerous asylum applications as states, are suffering from the problems of domestic violence and violence of permanent gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Immigration Board of Appeal of 2014 authorising non-documented immigrants from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a report on Friday, the Prosecutor General of Colombia County Karl Razinás stated that the new policy “is not in breach of the laws of the state, federal and international force that are in force for decades”.
‘In accordance with Federal law, decisions on asylum applications are required taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition is infringed’, says the comment made by amicus curiae.
In this note, lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering the country harm the US economy, and that it is more likely that immigrants will engage in business and provide the necessary job services.
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sesions informed immigration judges that they would no longer offer asylum seekers who are fleeing from domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
"Access shall be granted to those who leave their home country on grounds of persecution or fear relating to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views", said Mr Sessions in the political report on 11 June.
There has never been an attempt to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day in the world.
Two times as the number of victims in Pala, desperately looking for the rest of the living
The situation of the rest of the living is constantly deteriorating.
“It’s very big”, says the 35th Risa Kusum, rumbling his baby’s baby in the evacuation center of the town of Pala.
“The baby continues to transport more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water."
It has been noticed that people return to their ruined homes, collect excess water, and try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been affected, and the damaged 7.5 -point earthquake hospitals are dry.
Some injured, like Dwi Harris, who have had back and shoulder fractures, are being laid outside at the Palais Military Hospital – patients in the hospital are being treated outside for the continuation of severe repeated strokes.
His eyes are full of tears when he told us how he felt a severe earthquake in the fifth floor of the hotel, where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I had gone through the ruins of the wall," said Harry “Associated Press” and added that he and his family came to the town to participate in weddings.
“ I heard the cry of my wife’s help, ” he said.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope that they are healthy."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of fearing propaganda advertising
One week later, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the US daily, countering the mutual benefits of US-China trade, US ambassadors in China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the American press.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a supplement from the most popular Iow State newspaper, which he bought, and accused China to influence the US Congress elections to take place on 6 November. China is denying such accusation.
“D. Short accusation that Beijing is trying to influence US elections, marks a new phase of the growing Washington campaign aimed at exerting pressure on China”, said US officials Reuters Agency.
Although it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasing trade war, and both countries are breaking down the tariff for each other's imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese countervailing duties were imposed on exporters of Iowa and similar countries that supported the Icelandic Republican Party.
Terry Branstad – US Ambassador to China, former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural production to China, stated that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in an article published by the Dees Moines Register, T. Branstad said that China "is more wrestling about printing propaganda ads in our free press."
“As a result of the propaganda, the Chinese authorities used the respectful freedom of expression and the press in America and ordered the advert Des Moines Register,” wrote T.Branstad.
“However, in the local press of Beijing, you will not find conflicting voices and will not create a true picture of different views that the Chinese people may have about the worrying economic path of China, because the press is under the cool help of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers turned away from the proposal to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: in the run-up to the mid-term elections, Mr Kavanaugh fiasko has been deterred by the Republican voters
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brettu Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment, analysts warned that this would result in a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions of the situation are particularly strong, and many Republicans already formally claim to be willing to vote.
Such things cannot be withdrawn later," said Professor Grant Reeher of the School of Maxwell of Siracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Mr Reeher argued that the last minute of the appeal by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch the FTB investigation would be enough to calm down the bad voters.
"Womens will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors heard: "The county is approaching!" during the demonstration of the Senate's foyer, when the Republicers controlling the Committee of Justice decided to designate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's demonstrations, kzip reported "Mic".
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will touch the edges,” said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is independent of the website.
– People say that she was already strong, and they're right.
But it could also strengthen its positions, especially among unsolved women in the suburbs of voters and voters aged 18-29 who, although not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ch. B. Ford made public statements, when she detailed the accusations of sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts argued that if the Republicans confirm the candidate, this could lead to disrespect.
"It was a great confusion to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, last week, said NBC News.
"It is not only about the committee or final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed judge, but also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how Ch. B. Ford," said Guyus Cecilas, the director of the group that helps democrats in elections.
It seems, however, that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the demonstrations by Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, even though it has a little more support.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are totally or most likely to believe in the statements made by Ch. B. Ford, while 35 percent claim to be completely or most likely to believe by Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Mr Kavan Augh had, or would have, lied in providing evidence, and only 30 percent considered the same thing about Mr Ford.
In support of Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Mr Ford and the statements of at least one other accused, Mr Deborah Ramirez, reported to The Guardian.
Mr Ford's oath gave evidence to the Senate's Committee on Courts last week, claiming that Ms Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Mr. Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Court showed her his genius at the party where they attended the 9th anniversary of their studies at Yalis University.
The web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
The innovator of the global network Tim Berners-Lee creates a new start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project “Inrupt” by this legendary inventor is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform “Solid”.
Solide allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and whose information is accessible.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the aim of Inrupt is to control the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
- It's a historical moment."
“Solid” technology application allows people to create their own online personal data store – POD.
It may include lists of works, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
As Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Sppotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The personal data online shop is unique in that only the user decides who and which information can access.
The company calls this personal permission through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of “Inrupt” is to provide resources, processes and skills to make “Solid” accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Mr Berners-Lee, Mr Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work with this project, and a voluntary programmer community.
Since this week, technology developers worldwide can develop their own decentralised programs using the tools provided on the “Inrupt” website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google on changes that would turn up all business models overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
According to a report published on Saturday by Medium Berners-Lee, "Inrupt" is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the sustainability and quality of a new Solide-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a media consortium established at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even working with “Inrupt” Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the media consortium, the Knowledge Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I feel great optimism for this new web era,” added Berners-Lee.
Dear Bernard Vanne – the priest awarded the First World War Victoria Cross
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its home city, the only clergyman of the Anglican Church was honored, awarded the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vannas won the prize on September 29, 1918 during the attack on Belenglyz and Liguure.
Unfortunately, after four days, a sniper was shot by the pastor, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the highest-level British army prize.
Two grand grandchildren opened the memory stone at the time of Rindden, in the county of Noramptonshire.
One of the granddaughters Michael Vann said that the fact that the stone was opened 100 years after the grandson’s award was made is “a wonderfully symbolic.”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 the Lieutenant Colonel married his battalion on the Old Kenten Channel, “dropping a heavy smoke, laying a lot of fire in the cannons and automatics.”
Later he rushed to the firing line and led the line "especially powerful" and then attacked the basement alone and won three combatants of the band.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by the German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
For 72 years, Michael Vann stated that his grandfather’s actions were “something who had never been equal but, at the same time, very inspiring of humility.”
After the parade led by the Brentwood Emperor, Michale and his brother, Dr James Vanne, helped the crown.
Michalas Vann said that he was honored to participate in the parade, and he added: “The presence of real hero is shown by the support of many people.”
The MMA passions were not going to sleep all night to see Bellato 206, but had to satisfy “Kaylyte Pepa”
Imagine: You don't go to sleep all night to see the barbecue Bellato 206, but you don't end up looking at the main view.
There were 13 fights in San Chose Affish, six on the main card and live live in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, at the time Gedgar Moussi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for fighting, the film "Kiaulytė Pepa" stopped the UK viewers' broadcast.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not thrilled, because that was precisely the reason why they were not going to sleep until they had lunch.
In Twitter, one of the fans called a switch to a children's cartoon "some kind of patient's joke."
"Under the government's rules, 6 o'clock such content is inappropriate, so the children's program had to be activated," said "Bellator" chief vice-president Dave Schwartz for marketing and communication.
"Yes, "Break Pep."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cocker, said that in the future, efforts would be made to adjust timetables in the light of viewers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about the repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it," said Cocker.
“But at that time there is 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve it before Sunday in our time – Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Trust in the change of broadcast is the exchange of many messages that were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it is not a question of power.
I can promise that the next time this happens.
We will reduce the number of combats to five instead of six, as we do. We wanted to give more passions, but we just failed.
It's a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Thomas Daley felt unworthy because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, a Olympic jumper in water, says he grew up feeling less than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him reason to succeed.
24 A sportsman said that he only realized at primary school that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time, in the “Radio 4” edition of Lauren Laverne, he said that he had made public talks about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that having become a father, it was less important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a permanent leader in this long-term release, has left work for several months because of illness.
In the first edition of the Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said that it was lower than everyone else's, because it was socially unacceptable to enjoy both boys and girls.
He said: "As far as today's feeling of narration and reciprocity was the incentive that gave me the strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that he was worthy of doing so in order not to deceive others when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and has taken advantage of the opportunity to call for more countries to decriminate homosexuality in the course of this year's meetings.
He said that he was going to talk publicly about this because he felt that he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and would like to give others such hope as well.
Three times the world champion said that he was loved by a man, the US filmmaker Dustyne Lance Black, who met in 2013 – he was unexpected.
Mr Daley last year married a 20-year-old Oscar’s laureate, but he claims that the age difference never posed a problem.
According to T. Delay, when so young as they survive so much – in his first Olympics he attended only 14 years of age, and in three years after cancer his father died, it is difficult to agree on something that would be of the same age, but who had experienced the same height and lowness.
After the couple became parents of their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley, the perspective of Mr. Daley, according to him, has completely changed.
“If you had asked him last year, I would have said that it was important for me to win the gold medal, ” he said.
- But, you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic golden medal."
The son's name is the same as that of Grandma Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when the brain cancer was diagnosed.
Mr Daley, the father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether the tickets he had already bought to the London Olympic Games in 2012, which he intended to observe while sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that it wouldn’t last so long that I could sit in the first row, ” said Mr Daley.
- I kept my arm behind when he stopped breathing, and only then I finally admitted that he was not intact," said Mr Daley.
A year later, the sportsman competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of it all my life – to jump to the water while watching local viewers at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling,” he said.
This is also inspired by the choice of the first song – Heather Small work “Proud”, which reflected his feelings in preparing the Olympics and still pleasantly warmening the skin.
Desert Island Discs via BBC Radio 4 is broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 p.m. British summer time.
After losing the form, Ph. Mickelson spent the Riga Cup on his bench on Saturday's "Rider"
The American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Sunday, because for 47 times he will participate in the Ryder Cup tournament, but in order not to be a failure, he will need to significantly improve his form.
Ph. Mickelson, who has been playing for the 12th time every two years in the contests held, was planted on Saturday quarter competition by Captain Jim Furykas.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day in the support team, and the rest was improved on the field to correct the troubles.
Even though the career on the floor has not been hit very straight, 48 athletes are not the ideal player on the squares of Le Gold National, which have a long cut of hard grass for unscrupulous unscrupulous blows.
In addition, as the square itself would not be quite frightening, in the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will play against the extremely precise British Open Tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all four match of this week.
If the Americans falling behind in four points manage well to start the next 12 units of match, Ph. Mickelson's match can become absolutely decisive.
Ferrykas expressed confidence in his player but would probably not be able to speak differently.
“He was well aware of the role that he had played for him today, spread to me through his back and hung up his hand said that he was ready to play though tomorrow,” said Furykas.
– He doesn't lack confidence in himself.
He is the most glorious athletes on the list and in the past and this week gave a lot to these teams.
Maybe I didn't imagine he played two match.
I imagined more but went out like this, so we decided we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph.Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the most exciting player in the Ryder Cup.
It may be that this will mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which does not match his personal record heights.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven equals, but Furykas claims that his presence in the team has also brought intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcasty, contentious, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom to be in the team room, ” he explained.
– I think that younger players this week were also happy to compete with him, it was good to watch it.
It brings a lot more than the game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great victory can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that as the latest Ryder Cup competitions are approaching, they can easily progress to a difficult fight.
Danish sportsman debuted in 1997 in Machis Valderam, where a team of opponents led by Captain Seve Ballestero had a five-point victory against Americans, but the finish line was only crossed by a mere first result 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a big victory in Valderam; we had a big victory in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderam, where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (in the picture), who watched the 2018 edition wins the result at 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National Square.
So history will show me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you'll need every strength.
Go and do the right thing.
While there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we must pursue it consistently.
I always said, I trust the 12 players on our side, but we know very well who stands on the other side – the best players in the world."
He added: “I wouldn’t want to run out behind myself in any way.
The morning will be a matter for a different hair.
Tomorrow, the most important will be an individual game – it's something else.
Great play with a partner, when everything sits well, but when you're alone in the square, you're testing your ability to play golf limits.
The idea needs to be introduced to players: tomorrow, everything needs to be pressed out of you.
Now he's gonna have to separate from his partner, and he's gonna have to push everything out of himself."
Unlike Mr Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to appear individually better than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Ferrykas himself experienced both the surprises of the last day, because he was in Brooklyn in a winning team until Europe did not perform a miracle in Medina and did not turn them into losers."
“I remember every cursed word,” he replied, asked as the 1999 captain Ben Crenhaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
– We have 12 important match tomorrow, but we want a quick start – one you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the acceleration in one direction occurs, the middle match becomes very tense.
Accordingly, we formed our team and released the players in a way that we, you know... are trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Mr Thomas will have the task of trying to lead the countering fight and negotiate with Mr McIlroy's highest-level macho, and among Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahmas, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I chose these guys exactly in this order, because I think they will successfully overcome the whole game,” said T. Bjorn about his choice for the team.
Delivery of the new German military ship is postponed again
The latest German navy fregata had to start work as early as 2014 and replace the Cold War military ships, but according to the local press, we will not see them at least until the next year due to the ever-increasing systems and high prices.
According to a military representative quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, Rheinland-Pfalz – the main ship of the new class of Baden-Württemberg – is now delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was covered by the vessel which had already presented it, which had taken up the problem.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, ordered by the military fleet in 2007, will be replaced by the older Bremen class front.
They are thought to be equipped with a powerful substation, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and certain technologies of secrecy, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest freights to travel far away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, because of the continuing delays in state-of-the-art technologies, military vessels which, according to them, should allow Germany to direct military power to the overseas areas will cease until they are operational.
The unsuccessful F125 fregata last year came to the headlines when the German military fleet formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the military fleet returns a ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is unknown to a limited extent, but the German press mentions a number of major software and technical failures, which would have caused the ship to have believed nothing in the military mission.
The weaknesses in software are particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will manage about 120 seafarers' crew – these are half as small as those of the older Bremen class.
It has also proved to be too difficult to implement, reducing its effectiveness and limiting the possibilities for the fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the Germans used in the Second World War.
The cost of the whole project – alongside the pruning technical equipment including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to an amazing EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest problems affecting the fregate have become extremely important since the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is being undermined.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the military fleet was indeed "a lack of adequate vessels to use".
The officer said that problems had occurred over time because old ships had already been written down, but they did not find what they had to be replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class cops could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to secret bats of life
A new study carried out in a Scottish Highs Manor aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will watch bats, soprano bats, brown otters and aquatic mice in Vester Roso Inverevo's gardens.
Specific recording devices will be put in place at certain sites in the territory to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with manual detectors.
The analysis of all sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of signal from bats and one or other type of activity.
Then a map and report will be created for the residential areas, helping to form a detailed behavioural picture of the entire landscape.
“National Trust for Scotland” (NTS) environmental adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which residential area is the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of maintenance work on residential areas, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as to find out how best to maintain forest areas in order to be suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the bat population in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom has deteriorated.
They pose a threat to construction and real estate development, which has an impact on municipalities and destroys residential habitats.
Wind power plant and lightning are also threatened, like the muscakes, some chemical tools used to handle building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
The bats are actually not blind.
But caught a prey during night hunting is more helpful for ears than eyes.
The location of empty insects or obstacles within the flight path shall be precisely determined by means of an imaginary echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important penalties and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for viewing bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, hatcheries checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland in the Threave Manor, which lives in eight of the ten types of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the overseer of the manor, says that the territory of the manor is ideal for them.
“There's a great place for bats in Threave Manor,” he said.
- We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so work here and in other places will help you to understand better what they need in order to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking that bats are not used before the site is started, since accidental destruction of one hatch can kill up to 400 females and young animals, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Wastestocks shall be stored and shall not be killed, irritated or disrupted, as well as the destruction of their hatcheries shall be prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish bat guard fund, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have to learn a lot about our bats, and as many local species populations do, we do not know.”
Ch. Ronaldo rejected the accusation of rape – lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronald named him the accusations he had brought against the rape of lies, and said that people, using his name, are “caught out”.
His lawyers prepared the German news magazine Den Spiegel, which published the charges, to sue.
The attacker of Portuguese and Juventus clubs is accused of raped American Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
"Der Spiegel" said on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375 000 to make the event happen.
Speaking to 142 million followers in the lively broadcast "Instagram" image, a few hours after the announcements of charges, 33-year-old Ch. Ronaldo criticised the statements and called them "melagiens".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – liars – said five times “Ballon d’Or” laureate looking at the camera.
- They want to sing in my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, and to say my name is part of my work.
I am a happy man, it's all right," the sportsman added by smile.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of Ronaldo are going to sue Den Spiegel for the charges they called "an unacceptable publicity for things going on in private space."
Judge Christian Schertz stated that the sportsman will seek compensation for "moral damage, the sum of which would correspond to the significance of the violation – probably one of the most serious violations of the law of one of the individuals over the last few years."
It is argued that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the regional court of Nevada Clark, after the meeting at the night club Ronaldo and Mayorda returned to the sportsman's room, where he allegedly raped her by an anal means.
K. Mayorg states that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that there is a “99 percent good man” issued by the remaining “one percent” of his personalities.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sexual relations, but claimed that they had been contractually.
Mr Mayorga also claims that she had applied to the police, and her injuries at the hospital were photographed, but later she agreed to an agreement outside the court because she was afraid that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she continues to feel injured by the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was a bepereyin from Manchester United to Madrid's Real Club, and this summer, having signed a contract worth 100 million euros, he joined Italian giant Juventus.
Brexitas. United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Grego Clarko, Secretary for Business Affairs, the United Kingdom would "forever regret" if Brexito lost the world leader in automotive production.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota UK subsidiary BBC that, once Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would be suspended in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the lightening at the border in the event of Brixitus would result in a loss of jobs without agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyot models Auris and Avensis, last year produced almost 150 000 cars, 90 % of which was exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory," said Burnaston Marvinas Cooke.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honduras, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concerns about withdrawal from the EU without agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after a month of Brexit will close its Mini plant.
According to the car manufacturers, the most worrying threat to the Brexit supply chain without the contract is the threat.
Toyota's production line works when needed, because the parts of the custom-made cars are transported every 37 minutes from suppliers located in the UK and in the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be problems at the border with the industry, which may delay or delay delivery of details.
Toyot argued that it would not be possible to hold more than one day at the Derbyshire factory, so that production would stop.
According to Clark, the future plan for the Union's relations with Theresos May 'Chequers' is 'prepared precisely to avoid such border checks'.
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, will not only enjoy success today, but also use this opportunity", he said, for the BBC "Radio 4" programme "Tody".
"In addition to Toyota, data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue using a highly successful supply chain system."
Toyota could not say why production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in the Burnaston factory and is responsible for the Uite trade union meetings for 24 years, said that his trade union members are increasingly concerned: "I have experienced the loss of these jobs, they will never return."
A representative of the Government said: "We have proposed a plan for future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, the short meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
"For the fight against candidate for Supreme Court judges, a very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosensstein can be postponed for another week," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russian interference in the elections, links of the short-term assistants with Russia and possible interference by the President in the administration of justice.
The question of whether Trump would forgive a Deputy Prosecutor General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been teaching rumors in Washington for many months.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of microphones for conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosestein denied this report.
However, in the wake of his resignation reports, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was later delayed in order not to become a meeting of the Senate Committee on Courts, where Kavanaugha and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford witnessed the sexual abuse of women.
On Friday, Trump FTB ordered that the accusations made by Kavanaugh be examined within a week, thus once again giving back the vote at the plenary session of the Senate.
A short representative for the release of Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox news release.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not a fixed date, but it can happen this week, but in view of all events relating to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like the press to report news."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: since the 10th of September, Sanders did not attend any press conference in the White House.
Vedator Chris Wallaceñas asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rarely held not because they don't like TV journalists who are looking for "the effects of viewers". It's true, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are seeking an effect for viewers."
Then he said that Trump was more likely to communicate directly with the press.
"The President responds more often than any previous President," she said and added, "We have reviewed this statistics, without providing any evidence."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and have seen that this has happened many times over the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct contact with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to questions regularly when leaving the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
Press conferences of one person are rare.
The free and sometimes strange President's appearance against journalists this week, in New York, probably explained why.
Health Minister for Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote on the concerns raised by Brexit
Health Minister for Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote a letter expressing the country's gratitude and willingness to remain after Brexit.
A Scottish Member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote: “The United Kingdom-EU withdrawal negotiations continued and are approaching the expected solutions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also speeded up its preparations for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know you're all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I appreciate the contribution of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to the benefit of our patients and communities.
Scotland is really your home and we want you to stay here."
Emergency operation by Christion Abercrombie who has experienced his head's injury
On Saturday, the result 31:27 The Vanderbilt Commodores team was defeated by Christion Abercrombie’s emergency operation by the defender of the competition head trauma of the Tennessee State Tigers, reported to the journalist Michel Organ.
Chief trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the side line and just fell there,” said Reed.
Coaches and doctors on the sideline of Abercrombie gave breathing to oxygen, later placed on the carrier and sent for further research.
Chris Harris, an officer at Tennessee State from Nashville, WSMV, said that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilto Medical Centre had been completed.
Harris added that “there is no information yet about the type and extent of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, an official sportsman who spent the season, has moved from Illinois and is playing the first season in the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the match, he regained five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he regained in the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp fee
According to the new sectoral plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp fee and the additional money received will be used to help homeless people
This step will reduce the risks posed by the successful recruitment of young voters by the Corbyn campaign
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK tax-free persons
The Ministry of Finance expects to be able to collect up to GBP 120 million per year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK are expected to tax a higher rate stamp duty and use additional money to help homeless people
With the promise of more affordable housing and people with high incomes, this step is expected to reduce the risk of a successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign aimed at attracting young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK tax-free persons and businesses, and the additional money received will be used to promote the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
An additional charge – paid in addition to the current stamp fee – may reach up to three per cent for the rent of second houses or houses purchased two years ago.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to bring up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which results in higher prices and makes it more difficult for the first customers to buy.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making many rich areas of the country, and especially of the capital, home to cities.
The new strategy has been presented just a few weeks later, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax to be paid so as to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies that quickly bought land, but without using them, they supported high prices of real estate, and urged May to tackle the shame of British housing by abandoning affordable house quotas.
The Corbonne has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the prohibition of unloading without fault.
In addition, he wants to have more power to build new houses for municipal councils.
May said: “I told you last year that when I went to the Prime Minister I would try to return the British dream – for every new generation, life needs to be better.
This means that we need to put our damaged housing market right down.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
It is not fair, however, that non-residents in the UK and businesses established abroad can buy their homes as easily as they do hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of having housing has become almost impossible, and the threat of humiliating homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish Collection”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become the head of the Scottish National team.
The 42-year-old Scotch likes the challenge of revitalizing North-East club, currently in the third place of the first league and three points behind the first place.
Last season, St. Mirren has moved back to the Scottish Championship, and this summer he moved to Stadium of Light.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the B-collection, and it's over," Ross told the BBC program Scottland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up at Hamden stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish team competitions in my childhood, and this always led me back.
True, this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully."
To Ross, Dickas Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyceñas, Martin O'Neill, Royus Keaneñas, Gusas Poyetet and Paulo Di Canio were led.
Having previously rejected the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, a former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about starting work after such well-known leaders in such a big club.
"Now my success will be measured by the answer to the question "Can I bring this club back to the Pramier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club undoubtedly belongs to the "Premier" League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take it, but I'm probably just going back to the league to think I worked well here."
Ross' leadership career lasts only three years. He worked as a leader in the Dumbarton club for 15 months and replaced the Hearts coach.
Later helped to recover to the third Division the fallen "Alloa", and St Mirren's club, which was threatened to fall down, turned the winner of the championship the next season.
Ross says that it is now more satisfied than ever felt during his player's career at Clyde, Hartletool, Falkkirk, St Mirren and Hamylton Academic clubs.
"This change may have been radical," he recalls, "Alloa."
“I sincerely believed that it was good for me to take the lead – it was better than playing.
It sounds weird because I was lucky, I earned a lot, and I was happy with the satisfying achievements.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of problems have to be overcome every week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it, and when I grew up, I always felt that I was in my slapp, but the leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."
You can hear the entire interview during the Sportsound programme on Sunday, September 30, during the 12 noon in the summer time of “Radio Scotland” 12 noon at 12.00 p.m.
The studies showed that the best time for beer was on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of the poor beer in Britain, but it made the restaurant networks even more difficult.
The figures revealed that sales of beer and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants income decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, said: “Unending to the sunheat and longer than expected, English participation in the World Championship meant that in July, a similar trend continued as in June, when beer income increased by 2.8 percent. True, restaurants were hit even more than before.
In June, restaurant sales dropped by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became worse.
The main proceeds of beer and bars from sales beverages were undoubtedly the best results, and trade in them increased stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunrise has also suffered from the main proceeds of beer from trade in food.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of the way.
In well-ordered beer and bars sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent this month, and sales of food fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analysis firm in the leisure and fertility sector, asserts: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
As regards catering establishments, air and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be key factors.
It is true that the drop of 4,8 percent of the sales of several years will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to untidy cost-related pressures.
The most food-producing businesses could not come at a worse time for a long hot summer. Time will show if a milder temperature in August will give the necessary impetus."
The overall increase in sales in beer and restaurants, including newly opened seats, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the slowdown in the development of branded networks.
The UK beer, bars and restaurants sector and its guidelines recognise The Coffer Peach Track sector sales monitoring tool to collect and analyse operational data from 47 active groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion.
One out of five children has a parent's secret social media account
The investigation revealed that one of five children – some just 11 years old – has social media accounts that are hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of counterfeit pages in Insta is increasing
The new has strengthened the fear that the published sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account for their parents
One of five children – some just 11 years of age – is making secret social media accounts and hiding them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 high school pupils revealed that the number of counterfeit pages of Insta is increasing rapidly, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The new has strengthened the fear that the published sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they used a censored master account for their parents, but they also had a secret account.
A mother accidentally found a secret 13-year-old daughter's website, learned that she insisted on her offering, "Fals me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the independent School Directors' Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of pupils in the 11y-18 age group had two accounts, and half of these students acknowledged their appointments as hiding.
The MDK head Mike Buchanan said: "The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying."
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle has been elected as its consultant at the general annual meeting of the Management Body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Doyle has the highest honoured Scottish Late and the President. Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for sport leaders to take advantage of the diverse experience they gained in the past decade at international level.
“Eilidha earned great respect throughout the entire Scottish, UK and world sports community, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish Council will bring great benefits to Scottish sports”, said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as a voice for sportsmen and I hope that I will really contribute and help guide sport in Scotland.”
A 200-400-metre match in the Atlantic games of 1996 and a total of four Olympic gold medals won by an American, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, could not walk after a short-term ischaemic attack.
"Twitter" he wrote: "I had a stroke before a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell you if I will recover and to what extent.
We needed to work until we got away, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am learning mobility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Advertising of breast milk, comparing mothers with cows, received different online assessments
The company producing breast milk received different opinions on its advertising, comparing mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark the beginning of trade in a product described as the world's first quiet portable breasts, Elvie, a technology company dedicated to consumers, has released the inspired advertising of a ironic musical record. It aims to demonstrate the freedom afforded to mothers by new milk.
In this full military facility, four true mother dances by sound recording, for example, the words: "Yes, I lie to myself, but no tail can see" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not the umpteens, here is my breast."
The appendix adds: “Call him out, get him out, feed him babies, pull him out, pull him out, lie to my beauty.”
However, the advertising published on Facebook raised an online dispute.
The viewers responded in various ways to the 77,000 times reviewed and the several hundred comments received. Many claimed that it looked at the horrors of the dairy industry.
‘The advertising of this product by cows is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their newborn babies are born after a few days from them," said one woman.
Elvie breast milk for unseen room in the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comments: “It is possible that both the mother and the newborn are injured.
But why don't they use advertising that presents breast milk for mothers from whom they don't take away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a total misunderstanding. ”
Other commentators defended the promotion – one woman admitted that she had a song “very fun”.
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I'd still feed it.
I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is genomic," said one.
Another comments: “This heavy advertising is for mothers whose milk is drawn away (often in workplaces or toilets) and felt as cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discloses that all the dance with the bras are fitted with an unobservable mammary.
The campaign's idea is based on insight that many women who stop milk say they feel like cows.
However, “Elvie” milk does not spread any sound, does not have wires or tubes, and does not notice the space in the feeding bra, which allows women to move, retain infants or even leave home when getting away from milk.
The "Mother" partner and executive director Anna Balarin commented: "Elvie" milk is a revolutionary product, which deserves to be launched boldly and provocatively.
When we compared the feeding women with dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the cessation of milk and to all the challenges it was facing, while showing the incredible sense of freedom, which will be given by the new milk.
Elvie's milk into press headers was not the first time.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children displayed this product on the show by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp near Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially during the month, but the number of children detained by migrants has increased significantly, partly because of the fact that the strict rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and feared that addressing child care risks the possibility of staying in the country.
The June Federal Government announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families will have to provide fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities the risk has increased further.
Last week, Chief Executive of Immigration and Customs Service Matthew Albenceć witnessed to Congress that the institution detained several dozens of people who applied for care for unaccompanied minors in adults.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
"Almost 80 percent of these people – guardians or members of their families – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
According to the shelter staff, in order to consider cases of children faster, the officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month after the detention, not within 60 days, as was usual earlier.
Many applications for legal status against a judge on immigration will try to defend him by using a conference call, not personally.
Those who have no right to assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children remain detained, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to abuse breakthroughs or attempts to escape.
The defenders claim that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as the Tornilla shelter, which makes them more likely to fail to notice that a child is suffering.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to your friends can exacerbate the injuries that many have already suffered.
Syria ordered the Occupied Forces of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walidas al-Moualem, invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been taking place for eight years.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces on Syrian soil under counter-terrorism are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions”, he said to the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, the war with terrorism was almost completed.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this holy battle until we destroy terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
Syria has around 2 000 United States troops who mainly train and advise the Kurds forces and President Bashar al-Assad on Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1 000 land soldiers in a ward country.
When speaking about the problem of refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions for them to return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that has deterred refugees from returning.
“We went to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them get back,” he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction assistance when Assada and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
The UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel fortress in Idlib has created the conditions for more rapid progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has allowed us to avoid a large-scale attack by Russian supported Syrian forces on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines, and hoped that military action would be directed to the Gihadistes, including the fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which will be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, expects to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of the Government and the members of the opposition, which will draw up a draft Syrian post-military constitution and prepare for the elections.
Moualem has set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the committee – the work of the group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for the second term?
On the basis of such logic, in 2020 Trump would be elected unless, as may be expected by many liberal viewers, his presidency would have been put to an end earlier by the impeachment and scandal.
It would certainly be the most dramatic end of the ever presidential process!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for viewers.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time ratings on CNN television have increased more than twice as much as 1.05 million and MSNBC almost three times as much as 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million the best broadcast time viewers, whose number increased from 1.7 million to four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show holds the first place in cable TV ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers in the main news evenings.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, who produces ABC series Descedent about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers, who after the collapse of the camp camp, becomes president.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian writer and the author of “Only fun parts and some unpleasant truth as secret to the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said that he would vote in favour of Trump.
"Why?" asked her.
“He said, “He makes me laugh, ” ‐ said Scovl.
Chaos is precious in itself.
Of course, unlike others on television, the plotage that comes from Washington can lead to the future of the Roe v Wade case, the possibility of uniting immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
Sighting is a luxury that can only be allowed by the most privileged viewers.
However, it is more than necessary to be informed by a citizen when you realize that you have been watching for six hours already, as a group of experts are discussing how Bob Woodward uses non-public data for his book Baimie, Paul Manafort shows a stress of $15,000 (the top-up tributary tributaries) and what is meant by the shocking description of Stormy Daniels Trump anatomy.
At least I'm never going to Super Mario again.
“His actions resemble a reality show, because every night he throws something away from you,” says the Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" Brentas Montgomery, who is changing the performance of the Short Show and the day-to-day winds (the time of the conflict with N.F.L. or the maturity of Kim Jong-un.
You can't miss any of the series, otherwise you'll be behind it.
When I contacted Fleis this week, outside his home on the shore of the northern Kaiai was 27 degrees of heat and light the sun, but it was darkened inside and, recording CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not be opened up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had a station against the Senate Committee of Courts and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on the hair.
“I remember when we once created this crazy show, people said, “It’s the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Fleis.
"I thought there was some joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money goes to the Chamber of Representatives to fight against the strained middle elections
There is nothing strange about the conversion of the Congress Districts, which resulted in the attempt by two Members of the House of Representatives to win the same post, the 17th District of Pennsylvania was filled with money.
A recent suburban county of Pittsbergo has included Demo Conor Lamba, a member of the House of Representatives in the fight – he won his seat in another constituency last spring.
Lamba competed with the next Member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the previous 12th Districts of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
The signs of overcrowded when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in January that, in violation of the Constitution, the old districts were put to death for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the election battle in the new 17th District, the main party financial institutions – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DPCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) – have been in trouble with the campaign's finances.
Lamb in Pennsylvania became famous when a small majority of votes won the special elections held in March in the 18th Congress.
More than a decade of this place was occupied by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the constituency.
Political experts have given some advantage to the democrats.
The U.S. considered El Salvador to be punished for support to China, but then groomed
The diplomats noted that Beijing had already been recognised by the Dominican Republic and by Panama but did not, in principle, receive a negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in this country until partners moved to Trimp Organization.
“As regards the decisions taken recently, no longer recognised by the State Department of Taiwan, the officials decided to withdraw the leaders of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama”, said Heather Nauert, in a report published earlier this month.
However, sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately USD 140 million of American aid in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions on individuals, would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting of last year, which was considered an important step forward in order to prevent migrants arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September, the top officials made clear their wish for the conference to take place, thus substantially completing any deliberations on sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to show the importance of this gathering by the administration, Vice President Mike Penceć is now included in the list of speakers for the conference planned in mid-October,” said diplomats.
And the three messengers of America returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without giving notice of any of Washington’s escrows or punishments.
A representative of the White House refused to comment to Bolton on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, and they only agreed to discuss in their internal discussions if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst who is close to the administration and who has also spoken if his anonymity is preserved.

The report by the special advisor Robert Mueller on the possible interference of Trump with justice, which is a very strong evidence now available in public archives, can be kept.
In addition, as it is said, Mueller raises the question of whether the Trump campaign has not been carried out in secret cooperation with Russia which has damaged our elections.
If the Congress were to move to other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he is going to stand again before the voters, or perhaps finally also against the government commission.
There is a lot of "if" here, and I do not believe that the end of Trump is inevitable – as well as its equivalences in Europe.
All of us will have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will decide whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938 German officials were prepared to suppress Hitler – only they needed the West to resist him and support Czechs in Munich.
We fell apart and missed the opportunity to prevent further slaughters that lasted several years later.
History is around such essential points of the direction – then the uncircumcised progress of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans have now come to a number of such crucial points.
What do we do if Trump forgives Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosstein, a man who is dependent on Mueller's research?
The problems of Rosestein began when this newspaper announced that last year the official proposed to keep the president secret and considered his inability to perform this post.
Rosestein says that The Times is not accurate.
‘How will we react if the new FTB investigation by Bretto Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect or if, despite the compelling accusations of sexual abuse and false statements, this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in mid-term elections in favour of the Congress, which will force the Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is threatened with a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Jewish of Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Osvavimas by the same Nazi regime, once home, where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and in 60 years, I was sent to light the Sabbath candles on the table with svastika.
When I have such an inheritance, how can I view our future as unoptimistically?"

Graham Dorrans is looking optimistic about Rapid Vienna’s arrest of Rangers
On Thursday, Rangers Rapid Vienna will be admitted to the knowledge that if there were impressive competitions with Vilarreal in Spain earlier this month before the Austrians win, it could be in a strong position to leave the G group.
For the first time this season, the middle player of the road trauma, Graham Dorrans, was able to show up in 2:2 final contests with “Villarreal”. But he hopes that “Rangers” club can use this result as a trailer towards more important goals.
“We had a good result because “Villarreal” was a great team,” said the 31st player.
“We started playing in faith that we would achieve something, and we finished it.
Perhaps at the end we could have been more peaceful, but the competition in general was not bad.
They must have played the first chair better, and we've stretched the second and we've shown us who we're a better team.
There will be another significant evening of the European League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last competitions they have had a great result, but I do not doubt that with the support of the viewers we can get out ahead and get a good result.
Last year was really difficult – and what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; you work great.
I hope that we can now get out ahead, forget the last season and play successfully."
This fear of pension savings causes women to suffer from insomnia
Although the respondents to the survey had a clear picture of what care they would like to receive, a few spoke with family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwood study said that they talked about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t try to talk about it”, said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwood life insurance company.
That's what we need to do.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not inform your family about your wishes in advance, you will not be prepared to take care of you.
Talk to the counselor and family about where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Call the financial adviser. The counselor can also help you to think about how to pay these expenses.
You can choose to pay these costs for long-term care by means of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed life insurance certificate or insurance of your assets for as long as you have money.
Apply legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by means of protection documents.
Give you a mandate to health care. Dissociate a reliable person who takes care of your medical care and ensures that specialists respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
And think of the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you become inefficient.
Remember, your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and is being hospitalized.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?

The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the city of Indonesia on Friday, ” the officials say.
Because of the destruction of communication services, the officials were unable to obtain any data from the rendezvous of the Danube, which is located north of Pala, close to the earthquake of the 7.5 point.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Pala during the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongal on the island of Sulawes.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants of Pala is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, founded at the end of the narrow western Gulf of Sulawesi.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and hit the tsunami.
The Danube is a revolt along the coast of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
In the Regentium, a province in a smaller administrative region, there were around 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Sulawes, in particular in the coastal region of Danube.
In the province, the mining of nickel is also important, and it is true that it is concentrated mainly in Morovalis on the coast of the other side of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Pala and Dongala have been affected several times over the past century by the tsunamis.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Danube and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, he also killed nine people in the battle for the western Danube.
Indonesia, which is on its seismic - active Pacific fire ring, is constantly being shaken by earthquakes.
Consider some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Province of Aceh in Indonesia caused a tsunami on the north coast of Sumatra, which affected 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several severe earthquakes shocked the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed near the island of Nias.
In 2006, the 6,8-point earthquake hit the southern part of the most densely populated Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, the 7.6 - magnitude earthquake shocked the place near the western capital of Sumatra, Tyre.
More than 1 100 people died.
In 2010, the 7.5-point earthquake hit one of the Isles of Mentavay near Sumatra and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres, with villages and about 300 people killed.
In 2016, Pydie Jay's rehearsal, a small earthquake in Aceh, was destroyed and panic arose, because people remembered how everything was destroyed after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not stop, but ruining buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, severe earthquakes shocked Indonesia’s tourists on a massively visited island in Lombard and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Chief son of Sarah Palin arrested on accusations of domestic violence
As a result of the accusations against the attack, the son of Tuck Palin, the chief governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin was arrested.

He's also being accused of Class B misconduct, I'm punishing a day in prison and USD 2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
He was accused of attacking his father, Toddo Palin in December 2017.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called to the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently under discussion by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of an attack at home, an obstacle to reporting the crimes of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon in the face of the unwarranted attack.
His girl said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received the criticism of the Veterans groups, when cruel behaviors of his son related to post-traumatic stress disorder that arose from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after Friday to the Indonesian island of Sulavesio, a smog tsunami.
The earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawes, located northeast of the city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media share videos showing a moment of tsunami impact.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people were gathered to the beach festival in Pala.
Federal prosecutors New York terrorist attack suspect pursue rarely subject to death sentences
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking death sentences for Sayfulll Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that was not executed in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on 31 October, thirty-year-old Saipor from Home Depot took off his truck and held an attack on the bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – on the road, laying down pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in the Southern New York County on the intention to seek a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Siipova deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these accused points may lead to the death penalty.
After the attack a few weeks later, the federal chief swore for Saipov announced 22 points of accusation, which included eight charges for the killing of property (usually in the case of organised crimes against federal prosecutors) and the accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claim that the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and that, as Saippo carried out it, he called it a horrific, cruel and immoral.
‘As a result of the actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipopov, members and friends of the following families were injured, injured and lost their loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelio, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draks, Arilel Erli, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozo and Aleidandro Damian Pagnocco’, is indicated in the statement of intent.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case requiring the death penalty was dealt with a decade ago in New York South.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes was sentenced to two murders of drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment until his live head in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in New York Federal case against the spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, when they were sentenced two years ago to spy against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipova, originating in Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months after the attack.
According to the police, he declared to the investigators that he felt well about what he had done.
According to the accused act, Saipova revealed to his officers that he was inspired by video recordings from the Islamic State (ISIS) on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked the Islamic State flag to hang in the hospital cella.
He did not acknowledge his faults under 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders representing Saipov, said that they were obviously disappointed by the decision of the public prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty rather than to recognise guilt and to prison to a living head without the possibility of being released will only extend the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
The Saipo Defence Team previously asked prosecutors not to enforce the death penalty.
The Tori Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the conference of the authors Nigel Farage, he promised to mobilise the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of the Members of the House of Theresa May proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boneñas, a member of the Conservatives' Chamber of Associations, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already stopped now if the Brexit secretary had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faced in trying to unite the ranks of the disjoined supporters were revealed by the EU-sponsors who joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement its compromise plan agreed in Chekers when it is attacked by Brexit advocates, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Boneñas, through Leave Means Leave, said he wanted to ruin the Čekers plan.
He argued that Farageăs had to be an equal partner and had to be given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had led us, we would have already left the EU," he said.
He added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Čekers plan."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: “We were not fighting in World Wars to obey others.
We want to adopt our laws in our country."
Mr.Bone denied the idea that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false."
Andrea Jenkins, the advocate of Brexit, also took part in demonstrations, and said to journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, hear people.
The Čekers plan will not be popular among the general public, but the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be popular between members of our party and activists who go to the streets and, above all, vote in favour of us.
Undo the Čekers plan and start listening."
In her critical report May she added: "Premiers keep their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said that loving politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they give the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust for us, for people and for our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to give 'Brexit', so we're here today to tell them that we won't let them turn away from doing this."
In his appeal to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We mobilize the army of the nation of this country, which brought the victory of Brexit to us, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
And Brexit's opponents marched on Birmingham's streets before two hours of housing in the city centre.
After the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists played with "Toris v. Brexit".
Legiborist Lord Adonis anointed the conservative for the security problems they experienced on the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who say that they can install IT systems and all the technologies necessary for the option "Canada plus plus plus", without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
‘This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as Brixit, – he added.
Warren plans to take seriously the Presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election.
"Boston Globe" reported that Massachusetts was speaking about her future during a meeting with the public on Saturday's evening in Massachusetts.
Warren, who is constantly criticising President Donald Trump, is participating in the re-elections to be held in November, in which he will agree with GOP State Representative Geoff Deehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Short Campaign Massachusette.
It was guessing that it could negotiate with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon event in Holjok was her 36th meeting with voters using the format of the public meeting with the public.
One participant asked if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that is what women have to lead.

The police of Baton Ruža, the city of Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect charged with killing the LSU basketball player Waydeñas Simsa on Friday.
At a press conference held at 11 a.m., the Baton Rujo Police Department announced the detention of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
The police distributed the shooting video on Friday and asked them to help identify the man they saw in it.
The 20 - year - old Sims was hurled and died near the town of the South University early Friday.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came to the title of the World Champion when the team instructed him to bestow victory for Sebastian Vettelis
When Walter Bott on Saturday's qualification drive over Lewis Hamilton, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team in the race will be of great importance.
When the race began from the first place, Bott started well and, in defending his position in the first two turns, he was barely left in the trouble of Hamilton, encouraging Vettel to attack his team friend.
The goal was to get him back to the tail in the race, so it was fatal.
"Mercedes" turned into a two-way garage under the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but because of the actions that had not been completed by the contact, Hamilton broke forward, when the Ferrari driver, after two hours of manoeuvre, unwelcomely released the internal side of the route in order to maintain the position in the third direction.
The 21th birthday of Max Verstappen began from the end of the sermon, but at the end of the first circle there was already the seventh.
He was the fastest part of the race because he went without changing the tires to be as fast as possible over Kim Riikkonen and finish the fourth.
Finally, on the 44th wheel he turned into a two - edge garage, but the remaining eight were unable to raise the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line.
“Valtter was a difficult day because he had a great success all weekend, and when I was asked to spend, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and won two first places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump, during his Saturday meeting with the people, anointed Senator Dianne Feinstein because of his persistent denial of his contact with Christine Blasey Ford letter, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Britta Kavanaugh, was accused of sexual rape.
While speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly name Ford's presentation to the Senate's Committee on Law, he said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, indecent and wrong.
“What could happen and what really happens in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see that people are evil, wicked, undefiled and wrong,” he said.
“ When you see official statements and suffocations, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get married?
You remember her answer to the question, did he get the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Not at all.
I didn't get married."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we get married... no, we didn't get married", he added, depicting the senator.
Also in July, Feinstein received a letter setting out in detail the charges for Ford against Kavanaughu, which had been married earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been charged with her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I didn't hide Dr Ford's accusations and her history I didn't get married."
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I did it as she asked."
However, the president did not agree with her unborn president, who said at a meeting with the people on Saturday night: “You know, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't get married, but it was my worst man's language."
In continuing to defend the candidate for Supreme Court judges who were accused of illegal sexual conduct by three women, the President said that the democrats used charges for their own benefit.
“They are determined to recover power by any appropriate means.
You see the invincibles, indecentness; they do not care what they are hurting or what they have to pass to get power and control," the President's speech "Mediaite" was quoted.
Elite league: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer made two wins in the match with the Dandi club Giants
Dundee Stars has recovered for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the elite league and won the Saturday response match Dandi score of 5:3.
Giants came forward early when Patrick Dwyer and Frank Beauville won the two years.
Michel Sullivan and Jordan Cownieñis had a critical result by re-emergering Giants before Dwyerer.
Francois Bouchard, of the Dandi team, compared the result, but later the two presidents of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory.
The men of Adam Keefeño experienced the third defeat this season in the elite league, before that on Friday night in Belfast with the score of 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, the three previous match winner Giants.
Dwyer's first mandate was filled with the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendallo McFall's transfer, and after four more minutes, Beauville doubled the victory after David Rutherford's transfer.
In the difficult match Sullivan returned the arena owners to the game earning authority 13:10 and, after Matto Marquardto's transfer, Cownieñis set the score at 15:16.
The Dwyer made sure that Giants would go to the first break in his first drive, and at the end of the first seat he earned his second evening victory.
With a quantitative victory, the hosts of the squares regrouped and the Bouchard once again adjusted the result by 27:37.
Cownieís and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen break up at the end of the second seat for the first time in the match, and established the victory making the fifth team's victory in the middle of the last seat.
Giants, who have already lost four last matches from five, will meet Milton Keynes at home the next Friday.
The commander died to help hundreds of aircraft passengers escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero when he killed him to assist a plane with several hundred passengers to take a safe take-off to the air.
More than 800 people died, and many were kept missing after the severe earthquake that struck the island of Sulaves on Friday.
The area continued to shake with strong repeated underground blows and many people trapped in the ruins of Pala.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post on a massively floating control tower at the airport of Mutiaras Sis Al-Jufri.
He stayed in his place of work to help a safe take-off on the Batic Air plane that had a flight of 6321, which was already on the runway.
Then he jumped out of it when he thought that the flight control tower was going down.
He later died in a hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, the Indonesian air navigation representative Yohannes Syrat said that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We sent him a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kaliman to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“It’s a very painful message to us,” he added.
The government is concerned that the number of deaths can increase to thousands, as the country’s disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigio and Boutongo are difficult to achieve.
“It is believed that the number of victims will still increase, as many victims are still under the ruins and cannot be reached”, said the agency’s representative, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
By six feet [6 m] high, the city of Pala was destroyed, and a mass funeral would be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft shall provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old Risa Kusuma Sky News said: “Each minute's cars bring victims.
There is a lack of clean water.
Everywhere self-service shops are robbed."
Janis Gelfanda CNN, director of the International Indonesian Red Cross, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is about to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
The Indonesian President, Jokas Widod, arrived in Pala on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please all of you work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombard, where more than 550 people died.
Flight accident in Micronesia: Air Newgini now claims that when an aircraft falls to the lagoon one man has disappeared
The flight that ended in the Micronesia-based Pacific Lagoon, now says that one man disappeared, although earlier he said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking aircraft.
In the report "Air Newgini" she said that on Saturday afternoon she did not have any knowledge of a little man.
The airlines indicated that when looking for a man they collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers.
Airlines have not immediately responded to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water when trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officers reported that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all of them being stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events.
Airlines and the U.S. naval fleet reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some of the incident witnesses believe that the plane did not apply to the landing path.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane fell from a very low point of view.
“It was very good,” said Janes.
Jaynes told him that he and others were able to reach emergency exits when he was walking and flooded to the waist.
He said that the flight satellites were panicous and shouted, and he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. naval fleet reported that their sailors, who had repaired their near-by voyages, also helped to rescue people who were taken by boat on the beach before they boarded the plane at a depth of about 30 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people were killed in accidents on aircraft registered in New Guinea, but no one was in charge of Air New Guinea.
Analyst set the course of events in the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor’s Office has set out the facts available in the retrial case of a man charged with the burning of a woman from Mississippia living in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicted previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and demonstrated that he was not present in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth, saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "drawl because his truck was in Nasville."
Another coincidence was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
The records of mobile phones show that they knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, the Tel was deleted from his phone by the Chembers messages, calls and contact details.
“He pulled her out of his life,” said Halle.
It is foreseen that the defence will start to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge claimed that the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: who is the conscious hiphop?
The trio of Hiphop wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by sending positive messages to his music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippo has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the origins of the hiphop and reprove the conscious hiphop.
Artists such as The Fuges and Comon recently reborn in UK works of performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New Yorksitter brought a couple to court after he was dismissed because of a "racist" message
New Yorksitter brought a couple for dismissal from work because of discrimination after he received a false address message from a mother who complained that she was "one more black".
The couple denyed the racists and described the action as "reimbursement".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was upset after learning that Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEE, YOUR ANOTHER,” wrote Mr Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, it was sent twice, not to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to New York Post, the misunderstood Plasco-Flaxman was embarrassed and released from work in Maurice, claiming that the previous school, which was African, had failed to do her job and that she expected to be a philipian instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent to the Uber car.
Maurice has now brought a couple to court by demanding compensation for the dismissal and seeks to sue even USD 350 per day for a half-year's life and work at the customer's home, to which it was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that it is impossible to do such things," she said on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple turned away to the accusations of racism by denying it and saying that it was reasonable to forgive Maurice from work because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she offended her.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasz said.
“ Would you believe your children to someone who was rude, even though it was a mistake?
My new baby?
I don't think so."
Plasz said that she had a baby just two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to be right for that?
This is not a very nice behaviour", – added an investment banking specialist.
While the court case is being dealt with, the media were stunned to condemn a couple on social networks, criticising their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington fear that the readers do not understand the bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, soon after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get to know another place, which reads the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
When she said that her father, who had worked as an operator of BBC before finding inspiration to write a book about a beating bear, would not be overly upset if his job had been abandoned and added that the 60th year after his father’s death was a pleasant and sad year ago.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that his father was silently proud of his success.
“He was quite a calm man and was not happy to praise,” she said.
“As Paddington was as similar to him, he felt like having a child who reached something: be proud of him, even though it is not your job.
I think he had a similar assessment of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to Nica Louis Pasteuro 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nad always called and said that the condition really is bad, it is not expected to survive," said Mr Ednan-Laperouse.
“At the time I received a call from Nado, who called to tell her that she had two minutes to live, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I say good-bye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Physicians have slowly stopped working and left the body with medicines that kept its heart beat.
She died a little earlier, and it was the end of all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't fight, shout or weep because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept it in my own."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, who is now ruining his daughter of the dead, went on board with other passengers who do not understand how difficult she needs to face.
"No one knew," she said.
“My head was thrown down, and all the time the tears began.
It's hard to explain why, but it's on the plane that I felt a great compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The aim of the educative women's leaflets is to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost deadly loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wales Bridge spread postcards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call and call for help.
The son of Davis Tyler was 13, when he was depressed, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old, who lives in Livonne, Davis said that her son was a promising chef, separated by a smiling smile.
“They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit the room."
But he cast a job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his dead brother.
Mr Davis said: "I am afraid that a chain reaction can take place."
Davis has created posters, “that people may know that there are people around, even if it is a friend, to contact and talk.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mr Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mr Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, or complained,” she said.
“In the days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
During Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children blew up their gifts, he didn't look at them, nor responded in any way."
She said that his death was a huge injury to them, but they have to overcome it: “In this area he left the emptiness.
It's crazy with our heart.
But we all have to live on and fight."

The future of Bretto Kavanaugh was on the hair after the FTB's investigation
I thought if we could actually get something he had asked for – a study of limited length and scope – maybe we would bring some unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee was "bea" in the firm stands of supporters.
Why did Mr Kavan Augh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch its investigation?
Their contradiction is caused by time alone.
By the mid-term elections to be held on 6 November, only five weeks remain and, if it is expected, the Republicans will prove poorly, their efforts to elect the person they want to go to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George Busha called to the senators, trying to convince them to support Mr Kavan Augh, who worked in Bushu in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former personal secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
The vote will take place in Senate, which currently contains 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavan Augh Senate can get 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate his contacts and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, when the government came to Kim, the number of deserters fell ""
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserts to South Korea fell when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seugas, quoted by the Ministry of National Unity of South Korea, said that last year 1 127 liqueurs were identified as compared to 2 706 liqueurs in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were the strengthening of North Korean and Chinese border control and the increase in human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not submit any public comments.
In the end, South Korea's citizenship is offered to many North Korean deserts.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war, more than 30 000 North Koreans have unlawfully crossed the border in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demymitized zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns them to its homeland in a forced manner.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still under war technically, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyan for negotiations, the centre of which had been locked up in the negotiations on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when both agreed in principle to make the Korean Peninsula an area without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US that their sanctions had not changed since then.
“If there is no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally disarm the first one”, said Mr. Ri, at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh rescues it as “isterical” and claims that it is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Britta Kavan Augh, a candidate for Supreme Court judges, who said that he was unsuitable for service in the Supreme Court on his temper.
Mr Pelosi made these comments during the interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Ostine, Texas.
"I cannot really think that if a woman did that, it was said to be hysterical," Mr Pelos put forward his response to the evidence given by Mr Kavan Augh to the Senate's Committee on Thursday.
Mr Kavanaugh was emotionally disputed by the accusation of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were still teenagers.
At the time of his opening speech, when she spoke about family and high school times, Mr Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes implore to shouting or impoverishing.
He also completely condemned former democrats in the committee, in the name of the accusations against him, who were called the “grotish and coordinated destruction of reputation” by the liberals who were disgusted by the Hillary Clinton defeated the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosai claimed that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his partial attitude to the democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself by his own statements and by attacking the Clintons and Democratic Party,” she said.
It was asked whether to remove Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy had been approved and the democrats had received a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say so – if he lies to Congress or the FBI, it is not appropriate to perform duties not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” said Mr Pelosi.
Currently, Kavan Augh is a judge of the Columbus regional appeal court.
Mr Pelosa added that, as a democracy, the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh regarding the Access to Health Care Act or the Rome v Wade case are worrying for her, because it is considered as a conservative judge.
In the course of the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased judge to become a judge,” said N. Pelosi.
The power women should exercise
It is a legitimate criticism – after months and even years of pervasiveness that it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Steinem in 45 years.
"It doesn't seem unusual for me, but for you?"
She went on to say: “I was very helped by a woman, a head of a company, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but there was a way out: when she was angry and weeping, she said to a man who was talking to me at that time: ‘ You may seem sad to me because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just weeping on.
It seemed genius to me."
The tears are considered acceptable to the expression of anger, partly because they are largely misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories is from one of the first works at the office, where I was mainly employed by men, and where I was crying once because of the indescribable anger. Then I was a older woman at the base of the coupon, a reciduous head, who I have always been a bit afraid of, and pushed into the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying, ” said me.
- They don't know you're in love.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to overcome you."

In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught by a stranger on board a ship „Monkey Business“ (meaning an easy time to be allowed) and took back his candidacy, deeply disappointed by Mr Schroeder, that there was no reason why he could not stand for Presidents himself.
“ It wasn’t a well thought-out solution, ” said me laughing about it in 30 years.
– At that time there were already seven other candidates, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snake with seven thumbnails."
When the campaign was launched late, there was little time to raise funds, so she vowed not to announce the candidate until she got two million dollars.
It was an equal fight.
She observed that some supporters, who sacrificed 1 000 dollars to men, were confined to 250.
“Maybe they thought I got a discount? ” she thought.
Saying a speech that announced the beginning of a formal campaign, it was so embraced by the emotions of the people who supported it, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach the voters directly, not the representatives, and anger about sexism – that has been exaggerated.
“You would have thought that my nerves had failed, ” recalled Mr Schroeder’s response to her speech.
– You would have thought I was supported by the Kleenex wipe business.
I remember thinking about what's going to be written in a monument to my grave.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S. and Chinese trading generation can benefit Beijing
The first islands in the U.S. and China trade war were deafened, and although the battle has not yet been completed far from the end, according to the experts, divisions may eventually become beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning this year, after taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant resistance has taken place this week, when new tariffs entered into force, which will affect goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), i.e. in principle half of China's exports to the US will be taxed.
Beijing responded to all the measures at the same time as the most recent decision, a duty of between five and ten per cent on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has committed itself to fighting the teeth of the United States for the teeth, and it seems that this second largest world market is definitely not going to land in the near future.
Washington would mitigate sanctions only if China obeyed the requirements, but publicly bowing down the US would be too complicated for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing is to play its party properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US may have a positive impact on China over time, as they will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that would cause economic disruption in both countries is indeed much more dangerous than the observers have so far recognised," said Abigail Grace, a member of the Scientific Institute "Asia in the new American Security Center".
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walidas al-Moualem stated that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The progress made in combating terrorism has made the area much more stable and secure," he said.
The authorities continue their efforts to restore damaged areas and restore normal conditions to terrorists.
There are already all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country which they have left behind as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and well-being.
The UN estimates that around 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem argued that the Syrian regime would be pleased to accept assistance in the reconstruction of a depreciated country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries supporting the uprising.
Europe struck the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team, having arranged the U.S. team final score of 16.5:10,5, won the Ryder Riga Cup at Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The United States has already lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this continent since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn gathered 14,5 points to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had been hard during the entire tournament, launched a strike from the startfield directly to the water at the 16th well in a 3rd night match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player F. Molinari was thrilled in all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved the score of 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained the current form.
The American Jordan Spieth 5:4 overcome the lowest ranking in the European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustina Johnson 2:1 of the world's highest ranking lost Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Ryder Cup Veteran Spaniard Sergio Garcia has always become the most successful European player in this tournament, collecting 25.5 finals of his career.
“I’ve been crying a lot, but I can’t control it today.
It was a bad year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas that he has chosen me and believed me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get back the cup.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I could help," said Mr Garcia after the victory of Europeans.
He sends the estaphemy to his compatriots John Ram, who in the game of Sunday units 2:1 spoke to the US golf legend Tiger Woods.
“I am not sure that I am proud to defeat Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him playing,” said Rahmas 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his match in France and now owns a record of 13-21-3 "Rider" Cup career.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the top 14 prizes and are landing only for Jack Nickie.
The U.S. team did not manage to hit the propulsion side, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after a desperate team show: “I am proud of these guys, they were fighting.
There was a moment this morning when Europeans started to be pressured.
We were shooting.
I'm going to get my hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It's just supposed to bend your head down.
Our opponents were superior."
