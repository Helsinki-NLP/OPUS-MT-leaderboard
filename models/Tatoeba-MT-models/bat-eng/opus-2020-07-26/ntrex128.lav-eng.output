Wales Assembly members (Assembly Members — AM) worry about the opportunity to "be perceived as comfortable"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their job title to MWP (Member of the Wellsh Parliament — Member of the Wales Parliament).
It is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament" (Welsh Parliament).
AM is worried across the political spectrum that it can make them an object of laughter.
One of the Labour parties AM explained that their group is concerned "hungry with words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Wales 'twp' means 'one-sided', but 'pwp' means 'what'.
Lots Plaid AM pointed out that none of the groups were "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Conservative Party in Wales admitted that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that "MWP" was very similar to "Muppet", meaning "Purity".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the US letter "w" is spoken in a similar way to the German Jorkšier's dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing to change the title of draft laws, informed: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate members of the Assembly, of course, must be taken by the members of the Assembly."
In 2017, the Wales Government (Governance of Wales) gave the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposal, which provided broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission preferred Mr Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the greatest support for the public consultation.
The AM clearly suggests alternative options, but the fight for the agreement can lead to a headache to the Assembly Spyer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of the AM on how they will be called will take place once the regulatory framework has been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether the name of their country will be changed to "Nordic Macedonian Republic".
The people's vote was organized to resolve decades of disagreement with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request for EU and NATO membership.
President of Macedonia Gjoge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite's opponents for the change of name, announced that he ignored the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a matter to be done to join the EU and NATO.
St. Mārtiņš church calls to keep quiet, fighting for existence in Harlem's churches.
"As the old people I've been talking about earlier on every corner were through the bar and church," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is no more one, not the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"There are no more local living rooms, which people visit regularly."
Even when speaking to churchmen, he is concerned that the money received when selling the property will end faster than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point."
He added that it would be possible to replace apartment buildings with apartments that would accommodate people who would not help the rest of the temple.
"The biggest part of the people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and therefore the day will come closer when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these apartments will become members of these churches."
The two temples were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original white methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the black congregation who worshipped God next to him.
The black congregation of St. Martins’ Church took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson’s. On 125th Street, at Harlem’s main shopping street, he led a boycott of the working retailer who refused to hire or give them promotions.
The fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but as the members of the John’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Mārtiņš in the congregation, proudly called the call game "the calls of the poor people".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
The expert Tifany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Donisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a bigger call game in the Riverside Church.
Mr Merriweather said that the congregation of Sv. Mārtiņš did not replace him.
In the last few months, events around the church of St. Mārtiņš reflected the relationship between uninspired architects and builders, some of which had engaged in secular power and others in the episcopal diocese of the church.
In July, the Board of Association, made up of secular leaders, made a written appeal to the diecesis with concern that the definition "will try to pass costs" to the board, although the council was not involved in hiring architects and builders of the diecesis.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese activities.
Sharks hurt 13-year-old omari
Sharks attacked a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday and injured him. It was the first day of the Omariary season, says the services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends on Saturday morning had a kidney about half an hour when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then with the group went up to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at the beginning he had thought that it was just excited about the lobster caught, but then he'd understand that the boy shouted "I said!
I'm told!"
The whole bone of his key was broken," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
"I'm shouting that everybody leaves the water, "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was delivered by air to Ray’s children’s hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The attack on shark species is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Giles informed the media that a shark was observed in this area a few weeks ago, but it was recognised as not a species that was dangerous to humans.
Jail added that the victim had been injured by the upper part of the torso.
The officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad, Casablad, to Swami's in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Jails pointed out that more than 135 shark species were present in the area, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Saninsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's goes to the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with the rows of shelves of multi-storey style beauty products and trained sellers.
As part of a significant contribution to the UK's 2.8 billion pounds of beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sale of fashion and household items will be reduced, 11 shops in the country will be tested for larger shelves of beauty products, and, if everything goes well, there will be more.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets search for the use of shelves that were previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" informed that I would double my offer for beauty up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more seats with brand zones, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re- place its "Boutique" decorative cosmetics line, where most products will be healthy — increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition to that, the perfume wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try the concession in two Sainbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and moving to small food purchases every day in local shops means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit.
"Sainsbury's" CEO Mike Coupe has said that shopping venues will become more and more similar to universal stores, because the chain of shops is trying to deal with discount shops "Aldi" and "Lidl" offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Saninsbury's has placed Argos's outlets in several hundred shops and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the sales outlets and made the purchase more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical divisions ended with defeat.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the beginning of 2000, but the union broke out after a dispute on how to distribute income from pharmacy shops in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Saninsbury's 3 years ago, its 281 shops sold their large pharmaceutical business to Celeso, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for a GBP 125 million.
Under this plan "Lloyds" the task will be to supplement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy" in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for consumers, we have transformed the appearance of our shelves of beauty products and the impact of them.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now a charming goal towards beauty, a goal that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter John's "full of fury" after Holly Viloubija refuses from a 11 million pound deal
The "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "was taken to anger" after the TV programme manager Holly Willoughby refused from a 11 million pound transaction with his lifestyle brand to focus all the attention on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Viloubija has no time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The pair of business was compared to the Gwenth Paltrow brand Goop.
"This Morning" 37-year-old programme manager used Instagram to announce she goes away.
Holly Willoubie has abandoned the Star Dragon Den, Peter Jones, in anger, because at the last moment he left their profitable lifestyle brand business — to draw all attention to his new huge contracts with Mark & Spencer and the ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full" when a TV gold girl during a tight meeting on Tuesday in his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million meant that she no longer had time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared with Goop’s Gignet Plarov brand, and according to the hint, it will double the wealth of Viloubian, which is estimated to amount to GBP 11 million.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that he left Trilly, Jones took him from Great Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the information source: "Truly" was the main of the Holly priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, which would be dedicated to the next decade.
Her decision to leave was surprised by all those involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: all was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlova there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the head of "This Morning", one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions away because a lot of money has been invested in various products, from cushions and candles, to clothing and goods for the house, and even more will delay their placing on the market.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children’s mother, Viloubi and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Trily, together with Kep, was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Boldvina TV manufacturing company.
Viloubija must become the ambassador of M&S brand, and she will replace Ent McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones announced yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He commented on the criticism of news companies about a comment that some can recognise as "not good enough for a trader," and on the fact that he is so positive in relation to North Korea's leader.
Why is the President as much as he has refused?
Tramps said in his pictured "dicker of messages" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again once after Tramps acknowledged their initial meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed the world leaders on Saturday in the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the United States' "response" to the early steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continued with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
The tramp in her tongue was much more optimistic.
"We have great relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of missile testing, helping prisoners to free up and returning remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's just to give the President an impression, but instead of the 10,000 people who try to get into this very populated territory, we have 200 here," said Tramps, pointing out the crowd right before him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombardic earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the people of Lombard were resettled, the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a certain problem" said Ms. Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" collects a group for driving to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Pala in order to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given that earthquakes take place regularly in Indonesia, the state is still extremely poor for its natural fury.
Although sheltered tsunamis have been established in Aceh, they are rare along other shores.
It is likely that people’s death was also influenced by the fact that Pala did not give notice of the tsunami, even though the warning was valid.
Even in the most favourable times, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A ship-hombust that had been in prison in Lombard to treat the victims of the earthquake is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new destruction.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the infrastructure destroyed by Indonesia a central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large amounts of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has tortured Mr Joko's administration and is awaiting re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko must fight against the protracted problem of tensions between the sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using matchlets, bullets, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool player Daniel Starige is restoring balance in match against Chelsea with ambition
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from his loss to Chelsea in the premiere, getting the gates in the Stamford Bridge stadium in London at 89th minute.
Starijs received a signal from Jerdan Shaqiri, who was about 25 metres (30 yards) from the "Chelsea" gate when his team lost with 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then took the ball in the direction of the next gate stake.
In this attempt, the ball flew over the area, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The bomb finally passed over to the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shak (Shaq) always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," Starige explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kantty coming near, attacking the ball, and without thinking much, I'm going."
The “Chelsea” halftime was led by 1:0 after 25 minutes by the Belgian star Edden Hazard.
The "Blues" attacker played the ball back to Matheo Kovacic, before turning to the central part of the square and throw "Liverpool" on the side of the square as fast as possible.
The kovachichichich quickly played and received the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he did a nice blow between the players, allowing Azard to get to the area.
Azard beats through the rapid protection and completed the combination by carrying out the blows with the left foot on the back of the room network, passing through "Liverpool" Elison Becker.
At 15.00 "Stadio San Paolo" Naples, Italy, will fight with Napoli.
"Chelsea" with Videton UEFA in the European League will meet at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami victims reach 832 people
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, and early Sunday the state disaster agency announced.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5-magnidis earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) of high waves, the agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho informed the news conference.
The Palais city, where more than 380 000 people lived, covered the ruined buildings.
Police suspecting a woman in arrest 32-year-old man
The mystery investigation was launched after a woman’s body was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim with stabbing wounds was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John's (John) street, and a suspect of murder was arrested by a 32-year-old man.
The police have called for people in this area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has just started, but I would like to call on us to contact anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenheda and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something in their car video recorder materials, to contact us because it is possible that they have information important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local resident of Birkenhed, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and, as the police reported, they are dealing with the information of the closest relatives of the river.
The taxi driver, who lives in Graison Muzs, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that nobody could enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
The citizens are informed that they will be allowed to return for hours.
There was a hearing as a policeman tells a man that the whole area was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the scene of the crime.
She continues to say, "It's so terrible!".
Two afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was located right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled apartment houses.
All who have information are asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by calling 0800 555 111.
Kromwell's Statute becomes the latest scandal in the parliament of rewrite "history".
The withdrawal would be ethically justified on the basis of Taliban-like activities which led to the destruction of so many monuments of English culture and religion by his fanatical successors.
However, the Kromwell Society, Mr Crick, described the proposal as "silences" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Kromwell Society, said: "In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Kromwell outside the castle of Westminster will also become a goal.
Cowl himself either ordered or carried out the destruction of the festivals during the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong man, Cromwell, will be sacrificed for the centuries because of Thomas, who lived before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft shows the view of the 19th century and is part of his historography of a person who is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell many — perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century — were considered to be a parliamentary advocate against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
A historic debate is continuing on whether it really is a completely accumulating representation of the subject.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Kromwell is a well-known personality representing one of the parties to the then divorce.
His achievement, being a protector of the Lord, is worth praising and mentioning."
Pig-slought to death shattered the farmer in China
According to the information in the local media, the pig market was attacked and killed by the farmer in south-west China.
A man — just named Yuan — was found dead with a broken artery, all in one blood in the market in the province of Luppanshui in Guidjo (Guizhou) was reported on Sunday by South China Morning Post.
The pig farmers are going to inject the vaccines into the pig herd on 30 May 2005 in the Province of Xinning of China, Quinghai.
It is reported that he and his cousin were on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Junanny to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found a man dying and discovered that the house of the adjacent pigs was open.
He said that a large male of pigs in the pig’s body had blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the court medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy lawn had broken the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and chaotic," said the cousin -- he only mentioned his name Wu, written "Guiyang Everything News".
The safety camera material showed how Juan entered the market Thursday about 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or to his cousin.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the veri was turned on to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the site of the event.
According to the information Juan's family and market management discusses compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other human attacks are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man in their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man's critical injury.
10 years ago 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pig in Wales kept the farmer forced to the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After the farmers at Oregon in 2012 ate his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba explained that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "pistoles shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to fuck up, they're very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orkāna Roza's conclusion brings a wide and strong case in the South West of the United States
The Orcano Rose is projected to weaken over the coldest waters along the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rose will bring flooded rainfalls in the north and southwest of Mexico.
The rosacea winds reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) in five afternoon (after North American East Time), corresponding to an orcan of category 1 at 620 km (385 miles) south-west of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure plane is formed above the Pacific, moving eastwards to the east coast of the United States. Rozas, with tropical storm forces approaching the peninsula of the Lower California, will start on Monday with moisture mass moving deep northwards from the tropical bar to the southwest of the United States.
Roza will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity, in interaction with the approaching low-pressure plane, will form a wide area of heavy rains in the South West in the next few days.
Between 1 and 4 inches (~2.6 to 10.2 cm) rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
The moisture deep out of the tropical strip will cause the rain gases to reach 2-3 inches (~5,1-7,6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In part of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona, there are up to 24 inches (~5,2-10,1 cm) of rain.
Sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rains is possible.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert because of the threat of tropical rainforest.
Strong rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but the storms will bring local crumble winds and sandstorms.
A low-pressure compact approach will bring a local, strong part of the affairs on the coast of South California.
The rain gases are likely to exceed half a inch (~1.3 cm) together and can cause small mud flows and slippery roads.
It will be the first rain gas in the wet season of the region.
The isolated tropical rainfall Arizona will start approaching late Sunday and early Monday before the rain takes over a larger territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
A strong rain on Tuesday will spread to the Region of Four Seas (DR Colorado, DA Jūta, NA Arizona and DR Jaunmexika) and last all Wednesday.
In October there are possible intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperature falls, but the tropical is still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature at a small distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between temperature in the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and in Saint Louis and Demoines, in Aiowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, we will try to develop and expand a long - term summer heat.
In most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, reaching 80 degrees or more (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees by Celsius) in large areas from southern plains to part of the northeast.
Temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (Farenheita; ~27 degrees Celsius), which would exceed about 10 degrees average.
Our long-term climate projections suggest that the average temperature in the eastern part of the United States will be exceeded in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Bretha Kaveno case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television channels with passion observed, according to the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and Kristine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which, as a woman claims, took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political undivided arrangement, which had been organised by the Arizona Senator Jeff Fleik (Jef Flake) to stop regular transmission by the broadcasters to report the latest turn of the Friday.
Forda informed the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate that she is absolutely sure that Kaveno was drunk and tried to draw clothes during the high school party.
Kaveno was disgustingly showing that he was totally convinced that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, all of this was watched by 20.4 million people on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered interest in average viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually comes up with problems, including people who are looking at the offices.
To get a better picture, this amount of viewers corresponds to the number of watchers at the exclusion games or the Oskars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest viewer, an average of 5.69 million all day long, informed Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS attracted 3,1 million, NBC – 2,94 million, MSNBC – 2,89 million and CNN – 2,52 million, informed Nielsen.
The interest remained high after hearing.
Fleuk was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the team of the moderate republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kaveno's appointment, the senator noticed CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning, when he, protestor suffixed, tried to get to the hearing of the Committee on Justice with a elevator.
In live CNN, he stood for several minutes at broken eyes, as barred.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "it belongs to power while so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasting were broadcast live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was about to vote in favour of Kaveno's vote in the Senate.
However, Fleuk claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would consider the accusations against the candidate made by a minority of Democrats next week.
Fleik was partially convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democrats Senator Chris Coons.
After conversation with Koons and several senators, Fleik made his decision.
Fleuk's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes for the approval of Kaveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate charges against Kaveno (Kavan Augh).
British Prime Minister Meja accused critics of political plays in Breksita
Prime Minister Teres Maye's interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, who criticised her plan to leave the European Union, accused 'political game' of the future of Great Britain and undermining national interests.
The British Prime Minister Teresa Meja arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the first page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister of the Fashion, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexita's plan on the future of Great Britain's relations with the European Union, the so-called (Chequers plan), stressing that the proposal to use each other's tariffs for Great Britain and the EU is "fully absurd".
Shame Sims: the police have arrested Dytheon Sympos, who is held suspected of murder of the LSU player
The police have arrested suspects of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-grade murder, informed the Baton Rouge police station.
The officials released a video showing the incident of Simsa with Simponi, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police glasses were found at the scene of the crime and found symposon blood on them.
After being interviewed, the police informed him that he had accepted Wade's shooting.
According to a lawyer, he was given $350,000 of security.
On Friday, a team of medical experts at East Baton Rouge Paris gave a temporary conclusion that the death was caused by a shot in the head of the neck.
The department thanked the mission group of police refugees in Louisiana, the Stat Police Criminal Laboratory, the Police of the University of South Africa and the residents of the territory for assisting in investigations leading to arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the lawmakers of the territory for their "teaching and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet in 6 inch (~1,98 m) the long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, in one game, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 falling bombs.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Woode announced that the team was "depreciated" and "shocked" about the death of Wade.
"This is what a person is always worried about," said Wade.
The volcano spills ash across Mehiko
The ash rising from the volcano of Pokapetla has reached the southern border of the city of Mexico.
After an activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcanic area.
The centre was followed by multiple shakes and tremors.
Images on social networks showed that car wind glasses in the area of Mexico, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are present with a plan of ash layer.
The geophysics have noticed 45 miles (72 km) to the activation of the volcano in the south-east of the capital since the 7.1-magnidis earthquake struck the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catholic separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the inconsistency of the independence protesters with the public order police and when thousands joined the opponents for demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on separation by Catalonia.
The band's disguised separation of supporters, which were hindered by public order police, hung them with eggs and touched the powdery color to form dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
And then the police used rods to prevent the slaughter.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters were involved in the confrontation with the united protesters who scandalted: 'Long life for Spain!'
According to local newspapers, 14 people were given medical assistance during the protest because of minor injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, which was praised by the Catalonians, the idea of independence in the region taken over remains intense.
The voters strongly expressed their independence, although the voter's activity was low, and those who were opposed to separation, were, in most cases, boycotters.
According to Catalonia officials, almost 1000 people were injured last year, when the police tried to stop voting at ballot points throughout the region, and there were violent clashes.
The independent support teams had gone on Friday night to prevent demonstrations of state police support.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw the eyes of my parents doing the joy of tears that they were allowed to vote, but now everything is stopped," he said.
Although parties supporting Catalonia's independence were won by a small but significant majority in the last year's regional elections, these parties have fought to keep progress this year, as several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or arrested and are waiting for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, who filmed on the phone to support protests in police, said that the conflict was created by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders in Catalonia, Uriol Juncker, who has been in custody since last year until the trial, declared that he would stand as candidates for the European Parliament elections next year.
'Calling in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish Government has directed against us,' he said.
London: Men arrested after running a car in a building
Three men (33, 34, and 39 years old) were arrested after the vehicle was repeatedly tripled against the building in London.
The incident took place in Balinagard Krescent on Thursday at ca. 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Maybe the car was shot at the same time from a tealet.
The button shock allows "Livingston" to win 1-0 "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first gate provided "Livingston" victory
The supported Livingston was stunned by Rangers, bringing Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games spent in Ibrox club manager's role.
Dolly Menga shock turned out to be decisive, as the Gary Holt team adjusted the situation with Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won guests during this season of the championship, and tomorrow they have to meet the leader "Hearts" from which they lag behind eight points.
Prior to that, on Thursday of the European League, Rangers took Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series without losses in the Division to six games, and the main coach in Holts has still not felt the taste of the defeat since the last month replaced Kenya Miller.
"Livingston" does not use the opportunity to treat dull guests
The Holt team with its direct game, which in a variety of ways made the "Rangers", had to be in charge long before they got words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but slowed down his attempt before the gate, then Alan Lithgow’s attempt after slipping into the legs to hinder the tap of Kreiga Halkett with his head across the gate line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the decisive gates came.
"Rangers" gave a free beat, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to provide a possibility for Mengam, who hit and got the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the "Rangers" managed the ball, but the protection of the guests turned out to be improbable and gatekeeper Liam Kelly, no one particularly did.
This continued in the second half of the day, although Alfredo Moreelos put Kelly’s gate to rescue.
Scott Pitman's attempt was stopped by the window "Rangers" store Alana McGrego, and Litgov left past the gates in the "Livingston" combination.
The Livingston zone continued to show the appearance of central bombs, while two calls for punishment — after Halkt’s fighting for the bomb with replacement Glenn Middleton and the hand play were rejected.
"Fenomenal" Livingston performance - analysis
Scotland BBC Alasdair Lamont on the Arena of Tony Maði
The Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great to continue overcoming expectations, increasing performance.
Their game style and personality have virtually not changed since he returned to the highest eschelon, but a great praise deserves Holts for how he has united the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, maintaining a first-class organization of protection, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Woral always kept alert.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under the authority of Gerard, they were far from those standards.
Their last bomb was boring — only once they broke into the farmyard — and this is basically a call for the "Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne looks forward to shared feelings
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
And then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked 25 000 crowds as a reason for safety, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, much of them deaf, also made their views known, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German Government to admit him to themselves.
The protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by a guest whose handler considers to be heroic and others despised as autocrat.

Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during disturbances
The Prison Administration (Prison Office) reports that six inmates were injured in the disorder of the men's strict regime in prison.
The disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorčes unbutterers about 9:30 BST Sunday and is still ongoing.

And in October last year, the staggering officers were sent to prison to resolve the serious disturbances in which the personnel were attacked by billiard bombs.
Orcken, Roza Fenix, Las Vegas and Soltleixittia are threatened by sudden flooding (likely to benefit the areas affected by drought)
Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but this is most likely to happen early at the beginning of the next week, when the Orccan Roza with the rest will move across the desert southwest, with a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued an alert on sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday, the western part of Arizona, the south-east and the south-east of California, and the Yuda, including Fenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Soltleixitija.
Roza is expected to move directly over Fenix on Tuesday when it arrives late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Fenix Twitter indicated that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones maintained tropical storms or depression status of 200 miles (320 km) radius from Fenix!
Katrina (1966) was an orcan 40 miles (65 km) from AZ borders."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2-4 inches (~5,08-10,2 cm) in the case of rainfall, reaching as many as 6 inches (15,24 cm) in some places.
Other desert south-west areas, including the central part of the Clinish Mountains and the Great basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2.54-5.08 cm), reaching as many as 4 inches (~10.2 cm).
For those who are not exposed to a sudden flood risk, the rain of Rose can become a blessing because the region has been struck by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainstorms may be beneficial, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought control (Drought Monitor), a little more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported byweather.com.
The road of Orcana Rose first leads to the peninsula of Lower California in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still on Sunday morning with the maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm finds its colder waters in the Pacific, and this is why it stops.
Therefore, an orcan with tropical storm forces is expected to reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or morning.
In the rain gas part of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The rain gases are expected to reach 3-6 inches (7,62-15,24 cm) from the Lower California inside the south-west part of Sonora, probably reaching 10 inches (25,4 cm)," reportedweather.com.
Rosa will move northwards, across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then move across Arizona and arrives in the south of the South late evening.
"The main threat expected from Roses or its residues is a very strong rainfall in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the United States' desert southwest," said the National Centre of Orcans.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountain areas.
The attack on Midsommer Norton: four arrests for murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man were arrested for a murder attempt after a 16 - year - old boy with stabbing wounds was found in Somerset.
The Ivoryn teenager was found in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 p.m. BST.

The police reported that 17-year-olds and two 18-year-olds, as well as 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in the territory of Redstock, Eivonna and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who could have a mobile phone material about what happened.
The tramp claims that Kaveno has suffered from the 'poor and anger' of the Democratic Party.
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the violent and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at the meeting in Weeling, Western Virginia.
The tramp stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the "lawlessness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno was shown before the Congress, where any accusations by Cristine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment of Christine Blisey Ford were vigorously and emotionally denied.
Forda also showed his accusations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President announced that on that day, 'The people of America saw' Kaveno's 'excellence, ability and courage'.
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history of service to the nation," he announced the efforts of supporters in Western Virginia.
President Kaveno's nomination mentioned the surroundings when he spoke about the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't want to, but actually I'm candidates," he said.
"It's why I go everywhere to fight for great candidates."
The tramp argued that democrats had committed themselves to the mission of 'prospecting and opposing'.
The first of the important votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno is expected to take place not later than Friday, CNN informed the Senior Assistant to the Party of the Republic of Lithuania.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many simply flushed when giant waves hit the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Indonesia.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to the festival in Palais, when up to six meters (18 ft) high waves hit the shore floor, washing many into death and destroying everything they were traveling.
The tsunami stood out after a 7.5 - foot - long earthquake.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and were not rang immediately, and they became victims," said the representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it ran all that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people beat in trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
The photographs taken in the flight by the disaster agencies show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and water-enriched mosques.
After the fall, the coastal city continued to dries on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency, BPPT's Communication, stressed that on Friday major earthquakes energy was about 200 times higher than the atomb of nuclear energy dropped to Hirosim during World War II.
The location of the city at the long end of the narrow bay may have strengthened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's damage was described as "wide" and informed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number and damage of victims could be larger along the coast line of 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the territory called Dongala, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"The Communication "was completely destroyed, no information was received from the Danube," informed Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were going to the areas affected.
"It is a tragedy, but everything could have been worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not being informed that the tsunami had been visited by Pala, although the officials claimed that waves arrived at the time of the alert announcement.
The video on the social networks hears that a man on the upper floor of the building desperately calls people on the street below that the tsunami is approaching.
In a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore by washing the buildings and machines.
The Reuters news agency was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electric power, which turned the communication Pala away by the attempts of officials to coordinate rescue.
Officials stated that the army had begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but those who were evacuated still need food and other first-hand goods.
The airport is only open to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo's evacuation centres in Pala were scheduled to attend on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the workers of theWorld Vision who successfully reached Palais from Donggala, and now live in the courtyard of the tarden's office, went on their way to the scenes of damage.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were destroyed," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams were determined to organise disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Pala with great experience.
According to the Indonesian legislation, the financing, resources and personnel of the overseas organisations will only be allowed if the site of the damage is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulija Ariani, representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government announces, "Well, it is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been established."
When Palu arrived on the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family members of the still unfounded people continued to hope that their loved ones will become wonders that will make life more lightening during natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled out of the runoff on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman printed under the slums of two days next to the body of their mother.
Gendon Subandon, a trainer of the National Paragliders team in Indonesia, had prepared two of the unconditional paragliders in absentia for the Asian matches that took place this month earlier in Indonesia.
Other of the trapped in "Roa Roa" hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "you teach me the burden of emotions."
Mr Gendon recalled that after the paragliders' team had spread news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he sent the WhatsApp reports for many hours to participants in the Palais Beach Festival.
However, the result of his messages was only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
"I do, it means that the reports did not reach the addressees," he said.

Canje West: rapper changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje Wests changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The law that previously known as Kandi Vesta."
The 41-year-old West was named Je for some time and used the name of his eighth album published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in the show "Sturday Night Live," in which he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell us that he replaced the singer Arian Grandi in the show, who stopped working for "emotional causes".
The West has said that it is not only a abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has religious significance.
"I believe that "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You", Vests explained earlier this year by discussing his album name with the radio conductor Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first, there was Canada, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which has thought about the good and bad in us, our confusion, about everything.
Album is more reflective of what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sons Kombs, who had so far been known both as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love).
The JAY-Z, which had previously cooperated with Vesta, has also not used or used a mind mark and large letters.
The elected President of Mexico promises not to use the army against the civilian population
The elected President of Mexico Andrec Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population at the time of the 50th anniversary of the bloody return for students.
Lopes Obradors promised on Saturday's "Taltelolco Plaza" " never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The units of the army killed peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when the movement of left-wing students spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by issuing subsidies to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education draw young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explained by the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various US government bodies made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A twofold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so lagging behind in the United States, and a further cardinal turning in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee told me that doubling funding could double the chance that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the US.
Lei, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Artual Intelligence Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order), published this month by Houghton Miffin Harcourt, is the Executive Director of the Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in China.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon (Kārnegi-Melon) University to create an artificial intelligence system that would exaggerate the American best Ofello (Reversi) player, but later he was the leading player of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Līse admitted the technology competition organised by the previous US Government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas about the future".
"Scientists in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants", says Lee.
"Not already, China attracts leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired university torturers to work on artificial intelligence.
Līle added that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its next generation of artificial intelligence development plan.
Līle explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation (National Science Foundation) and other government organisations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence (U.S. Defense Department) founded a single, joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is intended to bring together partners from industry and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence issues.
And this month, DARPA (the Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence) announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, US legislation, which was intended to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not been working for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the 'Nordic Macedonian Republic', taking a step forward, which will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's request for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that the name of its northern neighbour shows a claim on its territory and has imposed veto Macedonia for NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June, based on the proposed new title, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the changes would undermine the ethnic identity of the lenient majority of Macedonia.
President Gengre Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycotting has raised concerns as to whether voters' activity will reach at least 50% of what is necessary for the referendum to be declared valid.
The referendum newsletter asks the question: "Did you be in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of title, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the road to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as the EU and NATO members.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to live freely, in the European Union's shadow, because it means safer life for all of us," said Skopier, 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevska.
Although this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have declared that they will take account of the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the title, a majority of 2/3 will be required in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has informed you that no irregularities have been reported by one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62-year-old, voter in Skopje.
Mr Zoran Zajev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife of Zorica (Zorica) and their son Duschko (Dushko) gave their voices in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small view and sat chairs on the tents that were put on by those who were in the boycott of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join a lifted head, not through the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajev claims that participation in NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that most will give a vote in favour, the more than 80" percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajev said after giving a vote.
He said that the result "yes" will "confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters will participate in a referendum, less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 percent of the voters planned to participate in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them said that they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voters' activity must be 50 percent and another voice.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government, which came to power last May.

Shercer wants to bring the problems "Rockies"
Since "Nationals" did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to resume.
But Shercer (Scherzer), who is always ready to compete, hopes to use the opportunity on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies will be the current off games. And Rockies in the National League Western group is led by one game against Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Rockies" has pressed at least a white card with Friday evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but has still not obtained its first title in the Division.
"Even though we're playing the same way, we'll at least be able to entertain, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with a crowd and a second team, is probably the one that I'm going to face this year.
And why would I not want to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as it is said, is ready to let Shercer take a shot.
The Shercer, to whom it will be 34th, carried out on Thursday welds in the part of the outside of the "bullpen" and will throw the ball during the normal rest of Sunday.

Tramp holds myths in Western Virginia
The President mentioned the situation around which his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kaveno, had entered, while talking about the importance of Republican electoral activity in the interim elections.
"In November, everything we've done is threatened.
Five weeks to one of our time's most important elections.
It's really very, very serious: I didn't want to, but actually I'm candidates, and that's why I'm everywhere and fight for great candidates," he said.
The tramp went on: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, which acts right now.
And they are determined to recover power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, the opposite action.
They don't care what they're hurt, who they have to go out to get power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have taken on the mission of "prosecute and resist".
"And you've seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "the evils, the evils, the messy and the false".
He named the senators of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee on Justice Diane Feinstein, whom the viewers responded with loud calls.
"Did you remember her answer?
Did you flood the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant to the public
It was not surprising that Momentum activists wanted to place me under censorship in my local party.
After all, I am in the last line of Members of the Labour Party's parliament to date, who were informed that he was not desirable - all of this because we do not hide our opinion.
With my colleague, Joan Ryan, my fellow Member, went in the same way, because she took a determined stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement for censorship criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, of national security, of Europe, was ironic, but these were issues in which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Labour Summit in the Eastern part of Nottingham states on Friday that 'we want to make meetings inclusive and productive'.
The majority of the meetings that took place during the career of eight of my local Labour MEPs were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different, and the promises of a 'happy, more self-defense' policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to respect different views, and any views are assessed depending on whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues who thought our political views were similar began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and acceptable opinions, which I would not otherwise have agreed, whether it was national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly - and I do not really matter what I say - the market is followed by the use of social networks, calling for a ban on candidates to vote in the next elections, excluding the centre policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are confronted with the stress of sexists and racers every day, but never try to avoid obedience.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal the use has been made.
Jeremy Corbin last week said that the Labour Party had to develop a tolerance culture.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of opinion and with every distrust or change of selection rules, the party will narrow.
In the last two years, I have often given advice, inviting me not to jump on my ways, think what I'm talking about, and then "all will be in order" with me.
But that is not why I decided to engage in politics.
Since I joined the Labourers for 32 years as a student, responding to the negligence of the Tehran government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set out the task of fighting for better public services for those who need them most — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, either in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had reason to doubt my position on policy issues and where I did not agree with the current government.
For those who have driven the proposal on Friday, I can only say that, at a time when the country is determined to move to Brexit, which is harmful to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
However, the only thing I want to announce is not the Nottingham "Momentum", but my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labours: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that no danger of denying a candidate or reminding anyone in politics will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Undefined "Ayr" reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts can be somewhat divided in the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazing exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unspeakable team from ten.
After all, it was their great protection, as well as a much better use of opportunities that led the owners, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in all of our games and we are still not told, so I have to rejoice," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All due respect "Ayr", they made better use of their opportunities than we do."
The Grant Anderson attempt at the 14th minute by Frasier Climo, raised Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors had been assigned to the game, changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot caught an unrealized ball.
The climate increased the management of "Ayr" by a penalty, right at the end of the half-time, he got points, then realized the solo attempt, so the "Ayr" break went with 17-5.
But the "Melrose" half-time began with a good game, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, which was implemented by Begot, reduced the retardation to 5 points.
Then a long break came, because Ruaridh Knott had a severe injury and was taken away from the field on the crayons, but when the game resumed Ayr quickly moved forward, when Staford McDowell (Stafford McDowall) carried out a attempt that was carried out by Klimo.
The "Ayr" Captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player — with Bruce Colvina (Bruce Colvine) attempt, which was not implemented.
However, the hosts sat down, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card that caught Klimo without a ball, from the garden corridor, Mcferson took a tačdun at the back of the "Ayr" clay.
The Klimo realized the ball as it was before, almost from the start of its restoration, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the fifth attempt at the player Gregor Henry.
Still Game star seems to plan a new career in the restaurant business
The story of the committee's "Still Game" star Ford Kierran seems to be going to engage in hospitality business, as he found out that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he creates and participates with his old partner in comics Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next nine season would be the last show, and Kürnand apparently plans to live after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kronan planned to engage in Glazgov's "hidden restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bollivia trapped on land hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol around the cup in the Flote Stabu Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The fleet based on the fleet from Lake Tikitsk to Amazon has been deflected with the motto: "We are entitled to the sea.
Recovery is our duty."
In Bolivia, trapped in the land, the memory of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century about the lost coastline of resources is still alive, just as it is already long to fly again in the Pacific.
These expectations have probably been the highest for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is evolving, it is united and calm in its spirit and, of course, with positive thoughts," said Roberto Calzadilla, diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Bulgarians will be watching the judgement of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that after decades of interruption, it is in Chile's duty to discuss the granting of a sovereign exit to the seas to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the Syrian Hashemetic President of local origin, who is waiting for the conflicting fight for the next year's reelection, is also very interested in the judgment of Monday.
"We're close to getting the Pacific of the Pacific back," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider that the court judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it is accepted, no major change is expected.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to designate Chilean territory and its representatives have stated that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is adopted in the absence of six months after the final review indicates that the case was "not complex", explained by the international regulatory expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years of Bolivia's case have not moved forward, but, on the contrary, has delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's soldier's rhetoric is in the Chills, she said.
The negotiations between Bolivia and Chile will continue once, but after this it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged messages since 1962.
A representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Edward Rodrigues Velze Edudardo Rodríguez Veltzé, disagreed that the court had taken the decision unusually quickly.
Monday to Bolivia will give "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to the last 139 years of conflicts from which both sides will benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used maritime problems as political cruises.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to cut down what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it is possible to trust the United States
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to meet the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when it seems that the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is ready to resume diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with the leader of North Korea Kim Chenna.
Ri claims that they are 'fantasia' to hope that sanctions and refusals to declare the end of the Korean war still have not been lifted in the US, will ever make North Korea drop its knees.
Washington is cautious in terms of consent to a declaration before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Tramps want a second meeting.
But many are sceptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up an armour that the state probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is going to visit Phenjan next month to prepare for the next Kim's meeting with Trampa.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive head line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented the viewers with a row of absurd, huge items to the head wearable in the 2019 spring/summer seasonal collection, which glowed on the background of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been flooded with extremely unpractical hats, and these designers have sent their amazing achievements to show fashion.
Valentine’s most outstanding makeup was a beautiful sand - colored hat decorated with a wide edge of feathers that surrounded its head.
In the middle of the massive accessories there were arbūrze, magic hat, and even pineapples — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lips raised, and they served Hanibal Lekter rather than the high fashion.
One of the forms reminded the respiratory senses of diving, a tube, and glasses, while another resembled a fried ice cone.
And if you want to continue with a massive fashion, then the time has come.
Styla's observers believe that huge shoes are probably on the way to your nearest High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) of wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajovsky.
A very unpractical hat as a cult object on all social networks led to another great piece of tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as large as a floating model that did not provide it.
The reddish yellow bag, decorated with red beard and equipped with white leather handle took a special place in the spring/summer 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in Paris Fashion Week.
Slapper Luke Armitage explained by FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central business streets next summer, because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge size accessories."
John Edward: Language knowledge is vital for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for educational institutions and have maintained it in 2018, when the excellent exam results were obtained once again, which are further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other public events.
This school, which is attended by a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to ensure the best possible level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set out the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their career and their life as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement special school programmes, we can see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable object in our schools.
Nelson Mandel said: "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it stays in his heart."
It is a convincing reminder that we cannot just rely on English when we want to build relations and gain trust from other countries.
Taking into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages reached the highest mark.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools figures for 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest sign A in Chinese, and the same mark was also received by 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish.
This shows that support for foreign languages as vital skills for children and young people in Scotland will undoubtedly be needed in the future.
Today, languages are valued as high in independent school programmes as those of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, genetics and mathematics) group.
The 2014 survey of the British Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 percent of employers, as a reason for the inability to fill vacancies, mentioned language skills shortages.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential to a globalised world by increasing the opportunities for working with language skills.
Regardless of their chosen career, they will gain a real advantage in the future from such long-term skills when they acquire a foreign language.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language interrogator.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent did not miss a foreign language well enough to keep the conversation, but the French was the only one in which the number of people corresponding to a two-digit number was spoken, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for modern children to contribute to language teaching.
A number of languages, especially those in the languages of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in language.
Some schools will focus more on the most common languages today, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of Great Britain, in line with plans for 2020.
Even if your child is interested in something, independent schools will always be able to choose from a number of languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools have committed themselves to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At present, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien de faire (It has to be done).

Lebron's debut "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjego
Fani has finally waited for the moment when the first game in Lebron will take place in the composition of Los Angeles "Lakers".
"Lakers" coach Luke Walton announced that James would play on Sunday's presezon opening game against Denver's Newgates Sandjego.
But it's still necessary to decide exactly how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed "Lakers" on the official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell recorded on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing this week's practice, James asked about his plans regarding the "Lakers" six presezon game series.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need presezon games to prepare for it," he said.
Trump House in West Virginia Time, channel YouTube
President Donald Tramps is starting a series of nights today in Welying, Western Virginia.
This is the first of the five children planned by Trampla next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the objective of Trampa is to obtain support in the forthcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control in Congress after the vote in November.
What day will Trump's Headquarters take place in Western Virginia and how can you watch it online?
Trampa headquarters in Vīlinga, Western Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the trampo accommodation in Western Virginia online on YouTube.
Tramps is expected to talk about this week's hearing in the case of the candidate of the Supreme Court, Breta Kaveno, who has been accused of sex crimes, and the Senate's vote is expected to be held for a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main aim of this sitting is to help improve the situation of the Republicans expected by the elections in November.
The campaign by President Trump shows, therefore, that this next week's five places are to "activate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they belong to in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The monitoring of the Congress for his agenda is so important that the President will visit the state as much as possible, because we start a working campaign season," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to discover his name.
This evening's party, which is planned by Wesbanco Arena, is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will reflect it in the Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Tramps will visit Western Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for Western Virginia senator, who lags behind according to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has to come to help improve his results in polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at Western Virginia University.
Ridera Cup 2018: The United States has demonstrated determination to fight to maintain high expectations for Sunday games
After three sessions in "single words" Wednesday afternoon games in "toursome" format was probably what was necessary for this Ridera Cup.
Sporters love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, in which side do they think there's a success now?
"They were led by six points, but now by four, since I think it in a way means that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth on his way.
Europe is, of course, the preferred one, because it is at the forefront of 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spyt explained that Americans believe that the wind blows him into the sails and that they have reason for optimism, of course also in the person of Spyt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
The spy has been destroyed from the first hit to the lawn and is an example of a winner.
Those Gutullian defeats became increasingly louder when his round continued, a decisive blow was carried out to reach four times the same number of strokes, when he and Thomas had left two beams in two.
His blow in the pit, which resulted in their victory 15, was perceived with a similar call, of them, for his conviction that the American team has not yet been ejected.
"You really have to dig deep, and worry about your match," Spy said.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 beards to succeed.
The only players who have gained more points in the last two days than Scyt and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flywood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raven Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple lags four points and will not be harmful.
Molywood was the only couple who lived without a boy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine last beekeepers Friday morning.
This event and how their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flywood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can provide a potential European victory when the sun will take over Le Golf National.
It is desirable to both of them at the same time in different pits.
However, the talk of the European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webbb Simpson quickly ended up with this morning's hero in the "flourballs" format of Serhio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogie and the two double fronts led the Spaniards and Swedish combs into nine, and they were not even close to excite them.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help.
In the games "flourall" and "toursome" formats, it is so exciting to watch close pairs because of interaction, to watch what tips they provide, and what advice they do, and how the strategy can change the situation at a moment.
Europe has so far been better playing as a team, and the last days are far from leading, but this competition in the form of a "toursome" showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight for which many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
European sample of Raidera Cup last day under the leadership of 10-6
The European sample of Raidera Cup will start in a pleasant way for the last day after the Saturday "flourall" and "toursome" race ended with 10-6 years of leadership against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Franzsko Molinari (Francesco Molinari) were led by two victories over the hard-working Tanger Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the score of Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn, a European team to maintain the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the imprecise American teams in the morning competitions in the form of the "flouralls" and the series ended up with 3-1.
The United States were more vigorously opposed to the furms format, winning two match, but failed to correct the deficit.
Jim Furyk is required for a team of 8 points on Sunday 12 single-games to keep the trophy.
Flywood is the first European first year, which got four points in a row with Molinaire, called Mollywood (Molliwood) after a sensational weekend, is the only second couple in the Raidera Cup history, which got four points in the first four match.
In the form of the overflowing Woods and Patrick Reed, they then easily played the tired Wood and American newcomers Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic result of 5&24.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, for moments showed a great game, but he's lost 19 out of 29 match "fuvallls" and "foursomes" formats, in addition to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the games of the morning, he returned to his partner Henrik Stanson to take the second and the second place in the world's ranking.
Europe could not fully achieve its own, although the day of the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and fluffy wind.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They pressed 2&1 against the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the form of the "flouralls" and returned later to defeat the Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "toursomes" after losing the first two pits.
Just two times in the history of the Raidera Cup the team has played 4 points in the deficit alone games, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) team is enough for the team to only have an undivided result to keep the trophy.
After being located in second place two days, as it looks, Sunday counter-attack will be problematic.
North Korea declared that in "no" case it would not be unarmed unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea has on Saturday informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions has deepened its lack of confidence in the United States, and North Korea will in no case give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the world organisation that North Korea had taken "significant steps of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear test landfills and the promise not to ever spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate U.S. response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will under no circumstances be able to arm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korea's criticism of Washington's opposition to a 'step-by-step' approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement left the impression, because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had done in advance.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Chenna and Donald Trampa at the first meeting of the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Tramps promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean war between 1950 and 53, but the United States have announced that Phenjani must first withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to respond to the call to alleviate the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
'The US insists that 'denuclearisation must be first' and increases the level of pressure from sanctions in order to achieve the goal of power, even by objecting to 'declaration of the end of war',' said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on the roads is empty fantasies by the people who do not know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our lack of confidence."
Ri was not talking about the intentions of Kim's second meeting with the Trampa, which the U.S. leader had especially mentioned when speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically highlighted three times with South Korea's leader, Muon Jae-in, in the last five months, and added: "If the other side of the denuclearisation matter was South Korea, not the US, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri speeches was dramatically different from what he said last year in the United Nations General Assembly, when he stated that the targeting of North Korea missiles on the continental part of the United States was inevitable after the "Long President" Tramps called Kim a "missile" in a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Tramps, who threatened last year to 'full destruction' of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Tramps announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia emphasize that the UN Security Council should reward the Phenjana for the achievements.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should be vigorously continued without error until definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to obtain the depletion of funding for the Phenjana nuclear- and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside of the UN General Assembly meetings, and then informed that he will again visit the Phenjana next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He went away from Phenjana in July, providing that progress has been made, but in a few hours' time North Korea accused him of "gangster worthy demands".
North Korea, together with Munu, committed to dismantle the arms landfill and also the nuclear complex in this month if the USA took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wanted to see are the security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University will learn a lesson about how to relax
A new subject at Harvard University this year has managed to make students sleep more, and it is an attempt to address the most popular brutalism culture, which includes caffeine overcrowded study through the night.
One teacher found that in the world, students at the best university often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital) specialist designed a teaching object that he believes is the first subject of such a kind of study in the United States.
The idea of creating a new subject for him arose after speaking about the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, "Why do I just say it now when I'm in the last course?"
She found that no one had ever explained the importance of sleep — who surprised me — he told "Telegraph".
This year's first presentation of the subject of study, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sports achievements and improve overall prosperity.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Chief Executive of University Health Services informed that the university decided to introduce a training course after learning that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the study week.
The hours of long training shall include a series of interactive tasks.
One part is a picture of common house doors, where students click coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is influenced by sleep shortages and the importance of sleeping routines.
In the other part, students are informed of how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then students’ urban map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will be affected by cigarette smoking," said Professor Chessler.
He said that a culture that was proud of the ability to learn all night still exists and added that modern technologies and growing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be provided by students "the secret weapon" to fight stress, anxiety and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep turns the brain into a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Reimonds So, a 19-year-old callifornist studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chessler to develop the subject of study, after having participated in one of the professor's lectures last year at Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who get post-graduate education to learn a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Čeysler recommends students to install a modulator not only for the time they rise, but also when they go to sleep, as well as keep in mind how people harm the "blue lights" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the rhythms of the day, making sleep difficult.
Livingston 1 - 0 "Rangers": The man's gates are screwed by Gerard's men
Rangers was looking for another dire game for guests, when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrarda decided to lose 1 - 0 against Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to gain the first victory since February 4:1 triumph "St Johnstone", but Gary Holt (Gary Holt) team brought Gerard his second loss in 18 games, since he has become a manager of the club, and his team is located 8 points away from the Scottish Championship leader "Hearts".
Menga hit the ball in the gates seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of inspiration of Rangers did not seem after an attempt to smooth the result.
Rangers fall to the sixth place, while Livingston goes to the third, and in terms of the difference in gates it only exceeds Hibernian.
And "Rangers" may be another problem, because the judge's assistant Kalum Spensa (Callum Spence) needed medical assistance because of the head injury, apparently caused by the object of the further throw.
Jerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the "Ayr" to reach "Betfried" cup semi-finals.
In turn, Holts used the same "Livingston" 11 players who in the previous week took off "Hearts" one point, and he would be happy to see how his well trained team pressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers were more likely to manage the ball, but Livingston was better used by their actions.
They had to get the gates two minutes after the beginning, when Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to the gate of Alan McGregor, but the player of the center missed his great chance.
Then a faraway free beat by Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in the protection of Alan Litgow was only able to send the ball far past the rear leg.
Rangers took control, but the impression came that the last third is expected to play, rather than believing that it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, believed that he had to carry out a blow of punishment at 15 minutes, after he had been in contact with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the call by the Collabian.
Rangers carried out only two shots in the first half of the year, but the ending of the former Ibrox goal of Liam Kelly was not particularly hindered by the attack of Lassana Coulbaly, but by the modest attack of Ovi Ejaria.
Although the chance that Livingston started in 34 minutes would have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it already on their own efforts.
"Rangers" was not able to deal with Jacob's planned long combination again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher broadcast the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained balanced and chose Mengus for a simple end.
During the break, Kulibali replaced Raein Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, because he sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately tried to block.
But "Livingston" continued to make the guests play as they like, taking one long stroke for Litgov and Halket.
The Holt team would have been able to continue management at the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgovs hit his head from the corner.
"Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton" requested another penalty shot in the late game, after being confronted with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geger Meter
And now the page of our "Sunday Morning" almanaha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geecker, who grew up as a physicist.
Geger developed a method of determining radioactivity and measuring it as a result was a device known as Geger counter.
In science, the Gaeger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado (Coronado calls), where the main roles were played by externally unconvincing cowboy scientists Rogers and Deil Evans:
Man: "Who, at the joke, is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you will be able to hear the activity of atoms that are released from the activity of these minerals."
Evans: "Truly, it's really going to go!"
"Hanss" Geger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention continues to exist.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the wicked cells and kill them
The vaccine helps the immune system to recognise wicked cells
When using this method, the patient is getting immune cells that convert into a laboratory
Then they could "see" a protein that is characterized by many malignancies and will be injected back into the body
The trial showed promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognise bad cells found that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is intended to obtain from the patient’s immune system cells, convert them into a laboratory to be able to “see” the HER2 protein that is specific to several tumours, and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) Betesda (Bethesda), Professor Jay Berzofsky in Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoted the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon and rectum, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells in which the patient was "acquired" as to attack cancer cells has been used in a single type of leukemia.
In Kanje West after visiting SNL, dressed in MAGA hat, attacked the critics of Trump.
That didn't work well.
In Kanje Westss was evicted at the "Saturday Night Live" show after an incomparable performance in which he commended the US President Donald Trampus and declared himself to stand in the 2020 presidential election.
The third song, named Ghost Town, ended at the end of the evening, during which he worn a hat of make America Great, he started to wear loud phrases for democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trampa.
"Only many times when I speak to the white people, they ask: "How can you like Trumps? He's a race!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then it would have been a long time to leave America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" started with an exhibition in the main role of Mett Damon, in which the Hollywood star challenged the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate's Committee on Justice on the accusation of Christine Blisey Ford in a sexual attack.
Although not broadcast, the material with Vest's pity on social networks was loaded by the comer Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to throw West this way.
And West was still sorry to the viewers that his backstages had been mistreated because of his skull.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in the head!"
They laughed at me!
And they said I've lost touch with reality," said Wests, according to the Washington Exaliner.
The West went on: "You want to see what happens when you lose your connection to reality?" and promised to put on your Superman settlement, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love!"
"Varety" reported that his comments caused the viewers' whistles at least two times, but the team members of the show looked confused, and at least one person told the press release: "Study silence occurred."
The guest was last time invited to replace the singer Arian Grande who had died a friend reeder Max Miller a few days ago.
The West made many more confused with the song (I Love it), which he performed in the Champagne bottle costume.
He was supported by the Conservative Group's TPUSA leader, Candance Turner, on Twitter, who wrote: "One of the longest people: PATEICOS, WHO DO NOT DETERMINE THE PALIM!"
But the head of the conversation shows, Caren Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I chose not to hire a person (s buying his music or clothes, or supporting his "art", who, as I believe, supports and barges with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name by saying that he has now become "an essential previously known as Kandi Vestu".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was in the past Snoop Lion, and of course the false music legend Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then on the "shower that was previously known as Prince".
Indicted in the murder attempt of crashing in Belfast's restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of murder attempt after a man was arrested in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police informed that the incident took place in Ballihackamor.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Master's court on Monday.
Appeals will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (Public Procurement Service).
The star of "Trender Games" Kits Herington addresses toxic masculinity
Another Herrington is known as the sword-sensing John Snow HBO in the cruel medieval fantasies series "Trenal Games".
However, 31 - year - old actor has turned against the stereotypes of the brutal hero, saying that such characters often make young boys think they should be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he believed that there was a "problem encountered" and asked the question how to deal with toxic masculinity #MeToo in the era.
Another who recently married his three-game partner Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he had a problem.
"I can't think about what's wrong with masculinity myself right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem when they grow in view of the current problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male personalities may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He went on to say, "What is inherited, but what is taught?
What is taught in TV and streets that make young boys feel that they must be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because young men have clearly experienced problems."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any continuation of "Trender Games" or plunder, after the series ended in the next summer, stressing that "there are angry battlefields and horses".
Starting from November, others will play a key role in the renewed Sam Shepard Trie West, a story about the film producer and his brother robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Roz as the best thing that happened to him as a result of "Trender Games".
"I met my wife in this show, since it in a way guaranteed my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Another character, named Igrit, played in the fantasy series that won the Roza Emmy Prize.
In June 2018, the couple married Lesley’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China stated that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased rapidly by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820 000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual relations, suggesting changes.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly distributed in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen almost to zero, and Chinese health officials were informed at the conference in Junan province.
However, the number of people living in China has increased from one year to 100 000 people with HIV and AIDS.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
In view of national conservative values, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are underprotected sex outcomes in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its response to the problem.
Maxīna Voters denies that the employee has flooded the Republican Senators' data, is turning against "dangerous lies" and "theorys of attention"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters rejected the claims that her staff had published the personal information of the three Republican senators on the wikiped pages of Wikipedia.
The demorage of Los Angeles insisted that the claims were distributed by "ultra right" wing universes and websites.
"Love, lie and even more despised lies," said Voters on Twitter.
It has been reported that flooded information includes residence addresses and telephone numbers owned by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from U.S.
Information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when a hearing on the accusations of Breta Kaveno, mentioned to the Supreme Court, was held in the Senate group.
The runoff occurred some time after the three senators had studied Kaveno.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the origin of the records’s identification IP address is related to the Voters’ office, and revealed information about Voters’ staff staff, informed Hills.
"This unfounded statement is absolutely false and complete lies!" Voters insisted.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security on account of this fraudulent and false claim is compromised shall in no way be held liable for the leakage of information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely false and complete lies!"
The Voters statement soon led to criticism online, including the criticism of the former President of the White House of Press, Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It lets conclude that her temper does not match a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be a soldier.
He may not comment on the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
The task of Fleiser was to compare the Voters' reaction to the fall of the Democrats for Kaveno, who was accused of an overly angry reaction during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, Republican candidate for the loss of Voters' chair interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
In its communication, Votersa informed that her office had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be detected," she continued, "and that they will be recognised as legally responsible for all their works, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff's staff."
"Jony Coal 3" Review — Rovan Atkinson's half-wheel exhibition on spy films
It has become common to look for associations with Breksite in every new film with the British twilight, and this seems also true for this which has revived, the fantasy of the adventure comedy from Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Danish English and was reborn in 2011 with Danish English.
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, an incompetent Johnny English with a worn eyes and an unusually moving face has the right to create a mile after the second revitalization — his name is more than any other signal that he is a wide range of comical characters designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the dulled secret agent who, despite his strange claims on a charming fiction, is a little cluz, a bit Mr.Bin, and a shredder of that guy who plays a single note in the music of the Chariots of Fire in London in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also based on the traveler's and international, inconceivable character that Atkinson once represented in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left the chaos on his way.
At least one or two nice moments in the latest John Angly adventure.
I liked the place where Johnny English goes to the helicopter with medieval armor, and the helms of the propeller for a moment appear against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create comical impressions is well visible, but humor is quite weak and strange superficial, especially because "serious" cinema brands, like "007" and "Unlike mission" are using comedy with confidence as one of the components.
Humor gives the impression that it's more devoted to children than adults, and I think Johnny Anglie's absurd expectations are not as creative and purposeful as the tributaries of the Atkinson-memo film in the skin of Bina.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has entered a serious comb.
Cyber hacker has broke into the British super secret spy Internet network, revealing the identity of all British agents in this area, dislikes an active agent — the unfortunate low role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the pumpkin and the person who has already lost his full political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing something capable, with Teresa Meja a semi-like character, but there is not much in the scenario to work.
Her intelligence advisors inform us that, since all active spymen have come to the public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the unmaided Johnny English, who is now working as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a pair of fun jokes), because English offers to master a spy profession from the very foundations.
The coal is transported back to Vaithola for an extraordinary meeting and is combined with its former many victim assistants Bo, also playing this time in Ben Miller.
Bo now is a married man married to a submarine commander, a fun person who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully used.
And so Batman and Robin returned to her secret service and found Olga Kurylenko the beautiful fateful woman Ofel Lodi (Ophelia Bulletova) in Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Ministers have been dangerously trained by a merciless technology billionr, the evil Jason Walt, represented by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer bunch.
England and Bo begin their wild-fashioned  Odyssey: disguised for the noficians, they burn a fine French restaurant; they create a confusion of the secret to discover the Volta luxury yacht; and England causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
But whatever the film is attractive and crazy, it contains many television elements of children.
A lot of moderate elements.
Like other Johnny Anglie films, I can't wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that fully exploits his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work for four days a week but will receive a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn is going to discuss a radical plan by which the British will work for four days a week and the salary will be paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to make savings through an artificial intellectual revolution to the employees, giving them another holiday.
In that case, employees will be able to enjoy three days long weekends, while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources tell you that the idea of "answer" the party's agenda for the economy, and plans to change the economy to the benefit of those who worked.
The transition to a four-day week of work has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not take place on one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that corresponds to the party's objective of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day week of work in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party, as such, does not support this hunger.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The third-day working week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
John McDonnell, Minister of the Interior Bureau, used the Labour Conference last week to give his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonel explained that he was determined to take away the power of "the mass of directors" and "speculators" of the public service company.
The plans of the ministers of the apartments also mean that existing medium-sized shareholders in the water companies may not recover all their package, as the Labour Government could implement a "reference" due to injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees in company boards and to set up exclusive Property Funds to allocate 10% of the private-sector company capital to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindasie Grem and John Kennedy respond "60 Minutes" or an FBI investigation in Kaveno could change their views
The investigation of the FBI against the accusation made by the judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the Office could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their thoughts.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, looking at the hearing procedure, I said I had spoken to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the accusation became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, Grem’s vote is obviously impaled in the stone.
"I made a decision about Bret Kaveno, and there will be a terrible charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know, here's what: Brett firmly denied it," added Grem, referring to Christine Blisey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's a change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event involving impressive stars and having the same impressive mission: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great House of the Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Repere Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shannon Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the event established by the Global Povery Project International Defence Group, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting against poverty.
To get a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing a voluntary job, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of the ending of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Ciszen movement been, whose goal has been achieved for another 12 years?
Does the idea of awarding a free concert is a good way to convince people to act, or just another so-called "clikability" case when people feel that they can really influence what to do by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Movement "Global Cizen" claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters in an effort to achieve different goals.
It informs that these activities have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and enforcers established in the United Kingdom who are committed to "supporting children to grow fully", promising to provide Rwanda with USD 35 million to help put an end to the poor diet of the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave incomplete nutrition in the history of social injustices," Tracey Ullman, the representative of The Power of Nutrition in London announced in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5000 measures were launched, by calling on the UK Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced the funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Cizen" commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will be able to climb and fall away for failure.
However, as has been done by the great movements of civil rights and anti-Apartitions before us, we will also succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborr-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the war fleet "block" to prevent Russian energy exports – claims the Minister of the Interior
"In case of need," Washington can use its own war fleet to prevent Russian energy being brought to the market, including in the Middle East, by U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's activities in Syria, especially in places where it operates under the invitation of the legitimate government, were prejudicial to the research of new energy markets.
"I think that the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can, through its navy, ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the audiences who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were, in fact, the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he mentioned, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trump administration contributes to the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia with the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trampa's administration officers and also the U.S. President Donald Tramps are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trampa, would make Berlin "dependent" from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which doubles the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's ferocious resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after meeting with the US Minister of Energy in Moscow in September.
The US has expressed its negative position against Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from participating in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a great problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Federation of Industry, following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabetes Vorena, Senator of Massachusetts, will give serious consideration to his nomination for the 2020 presidential elections.
On Saturday, the Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Vorena announced that he was seriously considering standing as a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During the election meeting in Holok, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that she was considering standing as a candidate in the presidential elections.
"It is time that there are women in Washington, whose 'fine' incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think carefully about my candidacy in the US Presidential elections."
At the meeting of the Council, Vorena referred to President Donald Tramps, claiming that he would "take this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm concerned to the depths of my heart about what Donald Tramps does with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Trampa and his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno.
On Friday in a Twitter report, Vorena said: "Of course, before the elections an FBI investigation is needed."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of the Vorena supporters do not believe that she should stand for the 2020 elections.
According to the results of the poll of the Political Research Centre/Waste of the University of Suffolsk, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not stand for election.
Thirty - two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had been more supportive of receiving 38 percent of the election candidates and 48 percent against.
Also in connection with the possible candidate in the 2020 elections, the names of the high profile democratic party's work, such as the former vice-president Joe Baden and the Senator of Vermont, Children Sanders, appear.
The information agency "Associated Press" informed that Baden has committed to giving a formal decision by January.
Sara Peilina quotes Treka Peilina PTSS Donald Trumpe
Trax Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after calling in the military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of the PTSS and some of the vulnerability of the contributions that our soldiers return," she said to the public at the Tules, Oklahoma.
Peilina called his arrest "a obvious problem that all pretended to be invisible" and said of their son and other war veterans, "they are returning a little different, they are coming back hardened, they are coming back suspicious of whether they respect what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all other members of the military field have given to this country".
According to Den Bennett, a representative of the Vasil police department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence in relation to women and of holding a gun while being in a condition of reverence.
18 States, Colombia region meeting challenges for a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge for a new US policy that prevents asylum for victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian district on Friday in Washington submitted a brief presentation to the court counsel to support the asylum seeker who is confronted with the obstacles created by that policy, reports NBC News.
The applicants’ full name in the Grace v. Session case, which was initiated by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his member of the violent gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The Statu lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large part of the U.S. asylum seekers are, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigrant Board of Appeal in 2014, which allowed documentless immigrants who are fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday of Friday, General Prosecutor of the District of Colombia, Karl Racin announced that the new policy "does not ignore state, federal and international laws implemented for decades".
"The Federal Law stipulates that all asylum applications are examined according to the facts and circumstances of the claim in question and that such an obstacle infringes this principle," said the court's brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country harm the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary labour force".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and abuse of gangs.
"The focus is open to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Samuel said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all of the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day in the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Pala, the number of deaths doubled in the search process
The situation became more and more severe for the survivors.
"Situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old Riez Kusuma, comforting her fever-free baby in the evacuation centre of the destroyed Pale city.
"A minute's rapid medical service brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The people were visible by returning to their destroyed homes and extolling the water, trying to save all the things that were found.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 - magnitude earthquakes were overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwis Harris, who had broken the spine and shoulder, lay outside of the Palais army hospital, where the patients were looked after out because of the constantly strong aftershocks.
His eyes touched tears, remembering how the strong earthquake began to shake the fifth - floor hotel, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I seem to have been printed in wall ruins," said Harry to the Associated Press agency, pretending that his family had arrived in town for wedding purposes.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of attempted intimidation through propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came up with four-page advertising, highlighting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Tramps last Wednesday referred to the annex paid by China Daily in the sales newspaper Des Moines Register of Ayova, which accused China of trying to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November, but China denies it.
The accusation made by Trampa about the fact that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections marked what US officials said to the news agency Reuters, namely that it was a new stage in the increasing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While there is a completely normal situation that foreign governments place ads to facilitate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed towards exporters in states such as Aiova, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Aiowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on Sunday's publication "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses its good America's tradition of freedom of speech and free press, by putting paid advertising in "Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk, you will find a limited amount of differing views and you will not see the true reflection of such different views, which the Chinese people may have in connection with the worrying economic trajectories of China, given that the media are here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He alleged that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers had avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analyticals warn the Republicans of alienating women's election from the mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavan Augh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been raised, analysts have warned that they will experience a negative reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already been prepared to give their voice.
Such things cannot be ruled out, "The Hill of Saturdays was told by Dr. Grant Reeher, a policy professor at the School of Maxwell, University of Syracuse.
Richard doubted that the senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s recent encouragement to conduct the FBI investigation would be quite a reason to calm down angry voters.
"You will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and State Representative of the progressive movement MoveOn on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors at the front of the Senate sang "Novebris come!" when Republicans under the authority of the Judicial Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," the news portal was told by an independent political analyst Stu Rotenberg.
"People say that it is already high, it's true.
But it might be even higher, especially among the volatile voters and younger voters living in suburbs (aged 18-29), who often do not go to elections even if they do not like the President."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she made statements about sexual violence from a candidate for post of the Supreme Court, analysts point to a possible failure if the Republicans continued to put forward this candidacy.
'The Party of the Republics has become a juicy chaos,' said Michael Steele, the former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republics, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
'This is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be condemned, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have treated it,' said Gay Cecil, Director of Priority USA, who is leading this group to help elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are slightly divided about who believe in the evidence of Ford and Kaveno, a little more inclined to believe in the last.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 percent claim that certain or most are inclined to believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have prayed for its own testimony, while only 30 percent had said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that after the move by Fleik, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda showed in the Committee on Justice of the Senate that Kaveno had been subjected to sexual assault by drink at the age of 17.
Ramireza claims that during the study of the judge of the Supreme Court, a candidate has shown her his genitals at a party in the 1980s.
A global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest in technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the "Solid" platform opened by Berners-Lie.
Solide allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Liika said that the hidden intention of “Inrupt” is to “demont over the world”.
"We should do it now," he said about a start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solide technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data repository" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in one browser.
Personal online storage is unique with the fact that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal powers using data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solide available to everyone.
The company currently operates the Bērners-Lie, Bruce, IBM acquired a security platform, some external developers contracted for work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide could develop their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lie said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change, one night in full coverage of all their business models.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a report published by Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lie said that "Inrupt" is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on "Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet by setting up a Global Network Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the Berners-Lie has had an influential view of discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of "Inrupt", the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain in the world.
"I am truly optimistic about this new era of the web," rejected the Berners-Lie.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian Cross assigned to the clergy during World War 1
For 100 years, an event has been observed in its home city when the only clergyman of the Church of England received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lt Col Bernard Venus received this award on September 29, 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglisei and Lechaukorta.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the British military award he received.
On Saturday's show in Rasken, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandson Michael Vann said that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather had received an important award.
According to the newspaper London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Colonel Venus led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "through major fires caused by very thick fog and cannons and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the shooting line, and with the greatest courage he led the line ahead of taking up the cannon zone, where three groups were defeated.
Colonel Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Venus (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I would never be able to do, and that is also a very humble act".
He and Brother James Vann also put the crown orchestra along with Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the show.
Michael Venus claimed that feelings were "encouraged by participating in this show" and claimed that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people".
MMA fans were waiting all night "Bellator 206", but instead they were waiting for Sugar Pep
Imagine spending the entire night up to see Bellato 206, but in the end you've been denied the viewing of this main event.
In San José, 13 fights were included in the afish, including six main cards broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6 p.m. in the morning when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald intended to join each other, the viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised by the replacement of the transmission to Zuciņa Pepu.
Some were in a real misunderstanding when the whole night until early morning was awake, waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described a switch to a child's mult film as a "non-viable joke".
"The Government has determined that after 6.00 this type of content is not acceptable, so the switch to the children's program took place," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues.
"Coop Pep," "yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Cocker said that he would work on schedule planning so that future viewers in the UK could see these transmissions.
"Thinking about the repetition of transmission, I think we'll be able to solve it somehow," said Kokers.
"But the clock is there six morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switchover, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
It was not, however, controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problems next time.
We're gonna stop at five fights instead of six (as it has been until now). We tried to please the fans, but tried.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Deilie did not feel good enough for her sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic naughty, says that she grew up, feeling less valuable than others because of her sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not know that "not everyone was like me" until he started attending high school.
While visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Louren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympic Games.
The long-term programme’s permanent manager, Krey Young, has gone for several months as a result of illness.
When it appeared as an outcast in the Laverne's first programme, Dale said that when it grew up, it felt 'lesser' than others, because 'the company doesn't assume that girls and boys can like it'.
He said: "Like today's feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main score that gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there is "something" so that people would not hope when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympics bronze medal has become the leader of a high-level LGBT campaign and has used its appearance in this year's Friendship Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak to the public because he was happy that he was able to live openly and without difficulty, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that he met in 2013, "hurried unprepared" in Dastin Lance Black, a film-makers in the United States.
Dale married the 20-year-old Oscar Prize winner last year and claimed that the age difference was never an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much for such a small age" (his first Olympic games were 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone in your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said that his "all prospects" had changed.
"First year ago, everything that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? In life are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby."
His son, Robert, has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 40 years of brain cancer.
Dale said that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Deil attended the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive up in front of the housekeepers in the Olympic Games.
It also inspired his first song — Heather Small, performed Proud, which resonated with him on his way to achievements in the Olympics and continues to drive the chinade.
The Desert Island Discs programme is available on Sunday 4 BBC Radio at 11.15 after the British summer time.
From the exit of Mikelson reserve deposit to play Saturday Raidera Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th Raid Cup for a match, but he will need to change his strategy in order to avoid a failed turn of events.
Micelson, who has been participating in every two-year championship for the 12th time, was seated by Captain Jim Furyk on the reserve bench for the four-ball and two-pair games.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as it has been so often in connection with US teams, the fifth winner divided his day, acting both as a sponsor and participating in his game with the hope of correcting him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player, even at the top of his career, he is not the most appropriate candidate for the tense fight at Le Golf National, which regularly punishs inaccurate hits.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, Mikelson will fight on Sunday's ninth match with the precise British Open Championship winner Franzsko Molinari, who has joined forces with the young Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) to win all four match this week.
If Americans who lag behind four points at the start of 12 single-game match, successfully lead, the Mikelson match might have a decisive role to play.
Furick voicelessly expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He was fully aware of his role today, knocked on my back, put on my hand and said that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furicky.
"He is very sure of himself.
He is a great sportsman who has given so many of these teams earlier and this week.
I don't think I've imagined him playing two match.
I imagined more, but everything changed as it changed, and we'll count on it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will give Nick Faldo a record of the most played machi Raidera Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Ridera Cup career, which has never really coincided with his individual record heights.
Mikelson has gained 18 victories, suffered 20 losses and seven undivided games, even though Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's a fun, sarcastic and witty, he likes to ask about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the newest players liked to bathe him also this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
The European sample captain Thomas Bjorn knows that there can be a quick light in leading a significant shift
The captain of the European sample, Thomas Bjorn, knows from experience that a significant turnout in leading the fight for the last day of Raidera Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Dana was debuted in the 1997 matches in Valderram, where a team of opponents, the captain of which was Sive Ballesteros (Seve Ballesteros), gained five points over the Americans, but only now came to the finish line with a very small point of victory, namely by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had been placed under the leadership of Valderram; we were placed under the direction of Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a little victory," said Bjorn (in picture), watching the 2018 graduation group wins with 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, running under 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me and every member of its team that nothing has passed.
Tomorrow, you will give yourself everything.
Go to the square and show your best performance!
This will not end until the score is visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy, and we will focus on it too.
I have always said that I focus on 12 players on our side, but we know very well what happens on the other side to us — the world's greatest players."
Facilitated by what performance his players showed at the golf course, Bjorn rejected: "I never had fun early.
New challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow's for individual games, and that's a completely different thing.
It is great if, at moments when everything goes well, you have a partner next to you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully tested.
You must send this message to your players, namely, that they will give themselves everything in the next day in the game.
Now you leave your partner and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents' team, Captain Jim Furick will look at his players to show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who got three points out of four.
Furick himself has been on both sides of these major tournaments of recent days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and as part of the subsequent defeat, when European teams gained a sensational success, which is later also known as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damned name," he said, in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, united his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get to the fast-track you've experienced in Brooklyn, which you've experienced in Medina.
When this momentum is spread in one direction, it exerts a high pressure on mid-term games.
We then formed our own composition and ranked the guys in the way we thought it was right. Let's try to do some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy's main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I rank the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament," said Bjorns in relation to the chosen players in the game.
Re-use of the German new karke
The latest edition of German karflotes had to be put into operation in 2014, thereby replacing the warships of the ageing Cold War, but it will not happen at least until the next year because of the erroneous systems and the rising costs, it reported the local media.
The entry into service of the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg class Rheinland-Pfalz is now postponed until the first half of 2019 and reported in the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to join the military in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems had an impact on the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the karaflot in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen class fregates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-fight and anti-ship missiles as well as some sensitive technologies such as reduced reception of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential characteristics include longer periods of maintenance: it must be possible to place the new freightes for up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the continuing delay means that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate their power in the overseas countries, will already be obsolete until the moment of entry into service, in the Die Zeit note.
The failed front F125 last year was considered under all the headings when the German carflot formally refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blochm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the warfette returned to the yard after the ship’s delivery.
The reasons for this were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would make warships unsuitable if it was used in a battle mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will work in a large crew of about 120 seafarers, which is only half of the staff of the oldest Bremen class.
It also proved that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the military to make its improvements in the future.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes heavy-duty ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice the equivalent class of ships used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the erroneous hardware, the costs of the whole project (including training of crews) have also become a major problem.
It is said that this cost has been EUR 3.1 billion, initially estimated at EUR 2.2 billion.
The challenges associated with the new french are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Naval Force is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Head of the Committee on Defence of the German Parliament, admitted that the military was indeed "the first to miss the vessels to be used".
The official argued that this problem has become significantly sad over time, as old ships are taken out of service but are not delivered in place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class hairdresses had joined the warflot.
National Trust listens to the life of secret bats
The new study, carried out in one of Scotland’s highlands, is aimed at detecting the use of the landscape by bats in the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to protect them in the future.
The Scottish National Trust scientists at Invereves Garden in Vesteros will study pundursks, pigmejs bats, as well as brown long birds and water bats.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records in order to determine the frequency of bats and the species involved in specific activities.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view reflecting the behaviour of bats.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Drewar hopes that it would be possible to discover which habitat areas are the most important and how each species is used.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as setting up meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last centenary, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
These land are threatened by construction and development works affecting the loss of bat skies and residences.
Wind generators and lighting may also present a risk, like paper pulp and some building materials chemical treatments, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful during hunting than their eyes.
They use a complex counter-location approach to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land maintenance across the country, takes very seriously the problem of bats.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, tests on bats and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established in Scotland the first and only special bat reserve "Threave" for Scotland, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thopson, owner of the property, claims that this territory is ideal for bats.
"This is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are still enough things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
He stressed that it was important to check whether bats would stay in the area before carrying out maintenance of the property, because it might be possible that a single female skiing facility would kill up to 400 females and their babies, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, interfered or destroyed by their skies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Maritime Protection Fund (Bat Conservation Trust), has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we just don't know how they are going."
Ronaldo rejects accusation in rape by appointing lawyers to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the accusation against him as "false news" claiming that people want to "focus attention on themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
The Portuguese and Turin's Juventus football star is accused of rape by the American Kathyn Mayorg in one of Las Vegas's hotel issue in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep her silent on this incident, it said on Friday "Deer Spiegel".
A few hours after making these claims, Ronaldo, 33, through Instagram's online video, addressed his 142 million followers, stating this information about "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have claimed today is false news," said the fifth winner of the "Ballon d'Or" award in the Chamber.
"They want to be famous, using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for the cost of my name, it's part of my work.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," smile added the player.
According to Reuters, Ronaldes’ lawyers are going to sue the court about the claims they have made about "the provision of inadmissible information on grounds of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to an extent that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the "suit" class room of "Palms Hotel and Casino" in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the local court of the Klārk District of Nevada, it is reported that after a visit to the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he had an anonymously raped a woman.
Majorga says that after that incident, Ronaldo fell in his knees and said that he was "99 percent "very boy", but fell in the temptation of this one percent.
According to the information in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was the case by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of the injuries she had suffered in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fearing from the enviance" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34 - year - old woman claims that she does not want to accept the conditions of this reconciliation anymore because the incident has left a lasting injury.
At the moment, when the above statements were made, Ronald was going to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros went to the Italian chain "Juventus".
Brekks: United Kingdom's "for ever regret" loss of authors
"The United Kingdom "forgives it for all time" if, after Breksita, it loses its world leader position in the production of cars," said Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
Their "disturbs" the fact that Toyota UK announced the "BBC" that if the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production near the Burnaston plant located in Dirbia.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese author said that the delay at the borders in the case of Bruxita could be by agreement put on the play of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's models "Auris" and "Avensis", produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
'I think that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped,' said the Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after a month Breksita will close his mini-plant in Oxford.
According to authors, the main concern is that the supply chain is at stake if no agreement is reached after Breksita.
The Toyot production line operates in accordance with the principle of "use time" where cars manufactured on order arrive in parts every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, it would not be possible to hold up more than one day an inventory of more than one day in its Dērbishira factory, so it would have to stop production.
Mr. Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) for future relations with the EU, drawn up by Teresa May, is "precision calculated in order to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the "BBC" Radio 4 programme "Today".
'The demonstration of this not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue fully the very successful strategy of supply chains'.
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be stopped, but warned that the increase in costs in the long run would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as a coordinator for union association, said that his fellow members feel increasingly concerned: "From experience I can say that as soon as a post disappears, it does not return."
The government representative said, "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, reports White House
An important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rod Rosenstein can be held for another week, because the fight against the candidate for post of judge of the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno, continues, she reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the special advisor, Robert Mueller, who investigates interference with Russian elections, the link between the funds used by Trump and Russia, and the possible violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months in Washington, there has been a search for whether Tramps will release Deputy Prosecutor General and thus undermine Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of negotiations with Trampa and the possibility to leave the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he talked about his departure.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trampus was announced at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time.
Tramps said that "the better" would not release Rosenstein, but then the meetings were postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judicial Committee, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused them of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristīne Blezia Forda.
On Friday, Tramps ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the accusations made by Kaveno, continuing to delay the vote of the Senate.
The media secretary of Trumpas Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
Taujātas for the meeting of Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of hope has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for a week, taking into account all the things that happen around the Supreme Court.
But this is what we will see, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters contest this claim: Sanders has not conducted a press release of the White House since 10 September.
The leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of bolds is not due to the dislike of the television reporter's "lovers of celebrity", even though she added: "I have not denied the fact that they are dunes of glory."
She then proposed direct contact between Trampa, leading to an increase in the press interest.
"The President is involved in more questions and answers sessions than any President before him," she said and, without providing more details, she said, "We have been interested in their number."
Sanders said that the ghosts would still happen, but, "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States an immediate question, it is undoubtedly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot, and you see that we've done it in the last few weeks, and it's going to be a press release, instead of being able to talk to the President of the United States."
The tram regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated the reason this week in New York, with a reporter who was uncontrollable and sometimes strange.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff Scottish NHS about the fears associated with Brexit
The Minister of Health has signed up to EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) to express gratitude and to wish them strength after Breksita.
By letter of less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU, Jean Freeman sent MSS.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of standing applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fryman wrote: "In the course of the war negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal that led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of everyone, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues, both from the EU and beyond, offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our cared patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay here."
After the head injury, Christian Abercrombey is undergoing an emergency operation
An emergency surgery was carried out on the basis of a head injury by the state Tigers guard Kristjan Abercrombie, who won a Saturday game with the result of the 31-27 the Vanderbilt Commodores, reporting the Tennessean sports reporter Mike Organ.
The main trainer Rod Reed (Rod Reed) of the State in Tennessee told the reporters that the injury was acquired shortly before midnight.
"He came to the side line and said collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the coach and medical staff gave him oxygen, they put him on the crows and delivered him for further investigation.
An official in Tennessee told Nashville, a reporter of WSMV in Tennessee, Chris Harris, that Abercrombie was is isosperist at the medical center of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that, for the time being, "there is no information about the type/severe of injury" and the state team in Tennessee is trying to understand at which point this injury was acquired.
Abercrombby, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after the replacement of Ilonas against the command of the State of Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had carried out five blocks in total 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher national fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national levy when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
Such a step will neutralize the efforts of Corbine to attract new voters.
The increased national levy will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to GBP 120 million may be collected per year to be channelled into the provision of assistance to homeless persons.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and directing the additional funds they receive to help the homeless, it will today notify Teresa Meja.
Such a step is considered an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at better prices and to address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state levy will be applied to persons and companies not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional money being allocated to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the introduction of a higher level of charge two years ago for the purchase and leasing of the second home, could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury provides that such a step may be accompanied by a budget of up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents, thus exacerbating prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spok cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, which spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate, destroying the land but not using it, and urged the Mégé Mée to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to tackle the problem of British housing.
Mr Corbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on rent control and accommodation for no reason.
He also wants to give boards greater powers to build new housing.
Mrs Mejo said: "Last year, I mentioned that I would use my prime minister position to restore the British dream - that is, each new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means dealing with our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and set up their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, who are working hard in Britain.
For many, the dream of your home has become too long, and the problem of homeless people is still a matter of concern."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to drive Scotland.
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his greatest goal is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which is now the third place in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he moved to "Stadium of Light" after moving "St Mirren" back to Scotland's premiere last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got B Cup, and that was all," Ross said to the Spportsont in Scotland's BBC broadcast.
"But I grew up with my father watching Scottland games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in the management of the club."
The Finnish predecessors "Sunderland" club are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former "Alloa Athletic" leader claims that he has not been upset by following the footsteps of such large club-recognised leaders, rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsvičs in the past.
"My success will now be measured by whether I can return this club in a premiere.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it definitely fits in the premiere," he said.
"The return of the club's premiere will not be an easy task, but I'm sure I'll be here only after this task has been accomplished."
Ross is only the third year of his career as a deputy director in Dumbarton for some time and spent 15 months in the composition of Hararts coaches.
Then he helped the club "Alloa" to recover from falling to the third level and during the same season helped "St Mirren" to get the title of the champion.
Ross claims that at the moment it feels much more comfortable than during his player's career in clubs "Clade", "Hartletool", "Falkrik", "St Mirren" and "Hamylton Academic".
"They probably were true crucifixes," he remembers taking responsibility over "Alloa."
"I really believed that management was my real call — much more appropriate than playing.
Sounds strange, because I made good progress, lived from it, and enjoyed some heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
I have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my trap.
I have always wanted to drive and now I do it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so well throughout my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday 30 September at the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00 after the British summer time.
The survey found that the most appropriate time to enjoy pintes was at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
The summer heat wave has left Britain with less popular flags to melt, but it has put pressure on the restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that in July sales of rye and beard increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business advisory agency CGA, which collected data, said: "The constantly sunny time and the prolonged participation of England in the World Cup had meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, namely that the profit of the slums increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants experienced a fall.
The restaurants, whose sales dropped by 1.8 percent in June, have faced even more difficult situation in July.
The situation was the most favourable in drink shops and bars, as they experienced a much higher upswing than restaurants experienced downs.
Food - based crocodiles also suffered from the sun, but they were not as dramatic as restaurant workers.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out to some drink.
In the rocks and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent a month, while the sales of food decreased by 3 percent."
RSM recreational and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend at the end of April.
The weather conditions and the wide impact of social or sporting events are the biggest factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a drop of 4.8 percent in sales compared to the period of the previous year will be particularly painful for additional constant cost pressures.
For food providers, the long and hot summer could not be reached at an even more inappropriate time, and time will show whether the temperature that we usually experience in August will provide the most necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales between Croatians and restaurants, including new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales supervisor of the UK Croatian, Bar and Restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover exceeding GBP 9 billion and has incorporated the criterion of the sector.
Each fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from its parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that showed to parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, makes social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of false profiles on the site of photo sharing in Instagram is increasing rapidly.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "pure main" account, which is shown by parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who experienced her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to rape him.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of pupils between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and only half of them admitted that they maintain private accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers make up online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilida Doila will be "intelligent voice" on the Scottish Lightball Board
The annual general meeting of the Management Board of Eilidh Doyle was elected as the director of Scotland’s Lightentics without the right to exercise authority.
Doila is the most award-winning space and outdoors lightening, and President Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for those driven by sport to use her extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
"The oil is given great respect throughout the whole community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scotland's lighthouses will get a huge amount of benefits, involving them in the government," said Betty.
Doila said: "I want to act as a soft voice, and I hope that I can really engage and help to direct this sport in Scotland."
An American that won the 200-metre and 400-metre race in the 1996 Atlantic Olympic Games, thus in general acquiring four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandemic, failed to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, repeatedly learned to walk, and I can already do business exercises today!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Opinions Share About Breast Milk Pump Advertising, which compares Mother to Goat
The breast milk pump company has provided shared online views on advertising that compares nursing mothers with milking.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first silent breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company "Elvie" released a sticky dish advert to demonstrate the freedom afforded to breastfeeding mothers by the new pump.
Four real mother dances in a wall-filled herd of cattle at a song, the words of which read about as follows: "Yes, I miss myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not the umpteens, they're my breasts."
It goes on to say, "I get out, get out, I feed the babies, get out, get out, I miss my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has given a wide range of resonances online.
77 000 times the video that has been watched and hundreds of times commented has received shared reviews by viewers, and many say that it highlights the "fearness" of the dairy industry.
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just as we, too, have to get them to produce milk, make them hard and pump themselves, but their babies are taken away a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump inconspicuously belongs to breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: 'I understand that it is traumatic to both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote the breast milk pump for mothers whose baby can be kept?"
He also said: "Advertising creators did not know what they were doing."
Others defended advertising, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was "perturbing".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I would buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
The milk's rejection made me feel quite like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a genius product," said one.
Another comment states: "It is a fun ad intended for mothers who lose their milk (daughtered in workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "cart".
It's not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertising, the women in the group discover that they all dance with non-complying pumps placed in their chests.
The idea of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who separate milk claim to feel like cows.
But the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely quiet, has no wires and tubes, and it is inescapably part of the breastplate for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, hold babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin, a partner of "Mother" and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
In parallel with the milk-slipping women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milking, while at the same time showing in a entertaining and understandable way the amazing feeling of freedom which will be carried by the new pump."
It's not the first time the "Elvie pump" pump has come to the centre of attention.
During the London Fashion Week, two children’s mother appeared in the tongue of Marta Jakulowski in view of using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to the tent town near Texas border
The number of migrant children who have been detained has risen rapidly, although the border crosses as many people each month as before, and this has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult for children to stay at sponsors.
The majority of sponsors were also usually non-documented immigrants, fearing that when they openly apply for a child, it would threaten their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal officials declared that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, which would also be passed on to other authorities involved in immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official of immigration and customs enforcement, demonstrated before the convention that the agency had arrested tens of people who have applied for sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of arrested people were not previously punished.
"Almost 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household stay here illegally, and a large proportion of these persons are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute such persons," said Mr Albens.
According to the asylum officers, when they try to deal more quickly with child cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the courts within one month of being detained rather than 60 days, as the previous standard was laid down.
Many will use the possibility of a video conference call instead of coming personally to defend their legal status before the judge in the immigration case.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are being held in custody, the greater the chance that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, has been reported in line with information and evidence provided by asylum seekers in recent months from the system.
The lawyers argued that these concerns would increase in larger sites, such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often overlooked because of their breadth.
They added that moving children to the tent town, without taking enough time to prepare them emotionally or allowing them to repent of their friends, could cause injuries that many have already been struggling with.
Syria forces the United States, France and Turkey to immediately export their troops
Looking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is already going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegally in Syria in the face of the fight against terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They should leave immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, 'the war against terrorism has almost ended'.
He declared that Damascus would continue to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories were cleansed, both from both terrorist groups and from "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurd forces and the Arabs of Syria, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-spoiled country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem announced that the circumstances were great to return, and blamed "the spread of the rarities of certain Western countries" because of which the refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for reconstruction before an agreement on the end of the war is reached between Asada and the opposition.
The UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone under the last rebel support in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "is time limits" and hoped that the military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the fighters from Al-Qaeda associated group "Jabhat al Nusrah", who will be "deleted".
The UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new Committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, with a view to developing the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for the election.
Moalem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to a review of "the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of the intervention.
Why Tramps will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be reelected in the 2020 elections, unless, and possibly, many liberal observers, impulsions and scandals have been waiting for it to put an early stop to his Presidency.
And then 'it will be the most dramatic final of the Presidency all the time'!
At present, there is no indication of the relaxation of observers.
Since 2014, ratings have more than doubled in the most favourable CNN transmission time to reach 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News looks at 2.4 million viewers at the most favourable time compared to 1.7 million visitors four years ago, according to Nielsen, MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reicel Medov show) is the highest in the rating of cable TV with 3.5 million key news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people, because it's a matter for us to be inconceivable," explained Neal Beerer, the support of ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama tells about the Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by Capitol.
Nellai Scovell, the writer of the compositions, and the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" have their own theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that she would vote in favour of Mr Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "Why is he smiling me," said Miss Lovell.
Hooss is to some extent entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV, the news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the situation of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged observers.
And yet it's more than to be informed to a citizen when you watch six expert groups discussing how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort (Paul Manafort) for 15 thousand dollars worth of bomber-type jackets from strip feathers and leather ("the clothing from which was absorbed," announced "Washington Post") and the role of Stormy Daniel, the passionate Trampa, to say, an analytic description of the details.
For example, I will never take Super Mario as before.
"Part of what he does, that creates the impression of the reality show, is that he is putting you in touch every day with information," Brent Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained about Trump's variable team and daily turnarounds (in the case of N.F.L., Kima Čenuna's celebrity).
You can't afford to miss just one episode, otherwise you'll be behind it.
When I met Mr Fleis for this week, time was sunshine,80 degrees (~27 °C) on the north coast of Kaiai, but he was sitting in an area where, without losing sight of eyes, he watched MSNBC broadcast while recording CNN.
He was unable to stand, not already when Brett Kavan Augh had to stand before the Committee on Justice of the Senate and his future in the Supreme Court threatened to break.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people claimed that "this is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows into the most ambitious parliamentary pre-election campaigns
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress Electoral Region of Pennsylvania is trying to get money thanks to the conversion of the Congress Areas, which will lead to two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently modified outskirt area of Pittsburgh is associated with the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who had taken his place in the special elections last spring in another area.
Lembs will fight with other Members, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former area of Pennsylvania 12, which is largely overlapping with the new area 17.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favour of Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new area 17 has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania, when he was won with a small victory at the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania in the widely observed March.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tramps won the area with 20 points.
Policy experts foresee a small excess of democrats.
The USA considered the punishment of El Salvador for Chinese support, but then considered
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under no pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trampa had a friendly meeting with Mr. Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, until his partners set up a team of management of the Trampa organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "no decision to recognise Taiwan anymore", the representative of its department, Heather Nauert, pointed out earlier in this month.
However, the penalties were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which received around 140 million amounts from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and the number of murders have reached the highest level.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an effort to prevent migrants moving to the US.
In mid-September, the State's senior officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, in essence by bringing to an end the observations made by El Salvador in full.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to participate in a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasises the meeting.
And three American ambassadors silently returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
A representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to negotiate internally, provided that their anonymity was preserved.
His story was shown by an external analyst close to his administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
History Study
The second stone garden could include a report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the fact that Mr Trampa may have been hindered by justice, which has had a great deal of evidence at the public's disposal.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has co-operated secretly with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the second party gets the upper hand of the Congress, Trampus will have to answer this structure and perhaps also his co-workers' jury just when he is going to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of 'but', and I do not claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Members in Europe.
There are choices that we will have to make on all sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to coup Hitler if the West had resisted and supported Chehs in Munich.
We fell down and missed the opportunity to avoid a year - long blood bath.
History turns around such turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trampa releases General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr Miller's trial?
Rosenstein has found it difficult since he reported that last year he proposed to keep a secret record of the conversation with the President and was thinking about his inapplicability to his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How can we answer if the requested FBI investigation about Bret Kaveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the position of judge of the Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and credible accusations of sexual attack?
And what is most important, will we vote in an interim election to Congress, which will take Tramps to account?
If we do not cope with all these challenges, democracy will experience a long winter.
But I believe that we can do everything by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish, who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as my own home.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with svastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such an inheritance?"

The "Rangers" star Grem Dorans feels optimistic about the fight with Vienna "Rapid"
"Rangers" on Thursday will host Vienna's "Rapid", knowing that the victory over the Australians after the impressive undivided game in Spain with "Villarreal" will allow them to take a stable position earlier this month to qualify from the G group of the European League.
The road trauma did not allow the center attacker Grem Dorans to resume his participation in the season games until the undivided result with 2:2 by Villarreal, but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this, because Vilarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old football player.
"We went to the game believe that we will be able to succeed, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have defeated them in the end, but in general, the undivided result is a good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we were in the second half, and we were in a better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be a easy game because they have achieved a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
The last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now there are new storms that I feel well about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the last season behind the back and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the participants in the survey knew clearly what care they wanted, there were little people who discussed the matter with their family.
About half of individuals in a national study indicated that they do not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care for them, but they don't do anything to talk about it," reveals Holly Snyder, Vice President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family to need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in setting costs.
Get your financial consultant involved. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies to cover these costs, or cash-based security through your property, the most important thing for you to have money.
Make your legal documents. You will prevent legal struggles before they start.
Talk to the authorised person on health matters so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act in accordance with your wishes if you do not be able to express them.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial powers.
Choose a trusted person for making financial decisions on your behalf, who will ensure that you pay your bills if you do not manage to do so.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being led to the hospital for emergency help.
Will you ask questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these facts in the written plan, so that this situation does not surprise you.
"And it's not just about finances, but also about who the doctor is," said Martin.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Take care that this plan is in place."
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfrakombe (Ilfracombe)
The man received several shots with an air gun on his way night at night.
The 40 - year - old victim was in the Ilfracombe Oxford Grove, Devonne, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and palm.
The police described the shooting that took place around 2.30 p.m. in the BST as "I don't want it."
The victims did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not endanger life, and the police are calling on witnesses to apply.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck Pala in Indonesia on Friday had killed at least 384 people.
Because of the destroyed communications, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Danube (Donggala) region, located north of Pala, close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnidis earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesi. It is estimated that in 2017 it lived 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunamis.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299 200 people lived in an area forming an administrative region of the province.
Fisheries and farming are at the heart of the economy of the province of Sulavesi Central, in particular in the coastal area of Danube.
The extraction of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, Sulawesi on the opposite coast.
According to the Indonesian Catastrophil Prevention Agency, in the last 100 years Pala and Dongal have been suffering from the tsunami on several occasions.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Danube.
The tsunamis also blew over the western part of Danube in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismic, Pacific fire ring that regularly forms earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A heavy earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of 6.8 magnets rose from Java, Indonesia’s most populated islands, leading to a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
Year 2009: the 7.6-magnitian earthquake rose close to the city of Tyre — the capital of the Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: a large earthquake of 7.5 magnets struck one of the Isles of Mantava (Mentawai) off the coast of Sumatra, causing the tsunami waves up to 10 meters high, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: the earthquake close to the surface came to Pidie Jaya area in Aceh, creating ruins and panic, as it reminded itself of the destruction caused by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time the tsunamis were not formed, but more than 100 people were killed by wounding buildings.
Year 2018: Strong earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourism island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Mara Peilin's oldest son was arrested following an accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska, Sarah Peilin, is arrested because he was accused of being attacked.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Peelin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for the suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a representative tried to call the police to report the crimes she claimed, he took her the phone.
The row is detained in the Mat-U pre-trial detention facility, and he has a $500 amount of security, reports KTUU.
He came before the court on Saturday where he was asked whether he found himself guilty, declared that "it was not certain to blame".
Peilin has been accused of three classes A violations that he can be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of USD 250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class violation, for which day long prison sentences and USD 2 000 large fines can be obtained.
This is not the first time that there are accusations against Peylin in criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todam Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Peilina, called the police and reported the attack.
This case is currently pending at the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, delays in the report on domestic violence and reinstatement of a gun in relation to that incident.
His girlfriend says he's gonna hit her face.
In 2016, the veteran groups criticised Sarah Peelin for linking her son’s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes created by tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake of Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.

Federal prosecutors want to demand that the rarely used death penalty be imposed on a person suspected of being a terrorist act in New York City
The federal prosecutors want to demand execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state of federal crimes since 1953.
As has been said, 30-year-old Saipov used the home Depot car to attack the bike along West Side Highway in October in Lower Manhattan, where he struck the pedestrians and the bikeist on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims with intent and caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the statement of intention to claim the death penalty submitted to the New York South District Court.
According to the court document, both of these accusations can be sentenced to death.
In a week after the attack, the federal jury accepted an accusation of the prosecution of Saipova to 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion purposes, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, as well as an accusation of cruelty and the destruction of motorised vehicles.
The attack required "critical planning and prior intent", explained the prosecutors, saying that the attack by Saipova was "suffering, cruel and inhuman".
"Saifullo Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayllo Habibullaevic Saipov) injured, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Djego Enrike Anjelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klēves (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Dekadt (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Drene Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernāns Ferči, Ernāns Djego Mendoza and Aleandro Damjans Pagnocco (Aleandro Damian Pagnucco)," wrote a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the New York South District Court charged with a case where the death penalty can be imposed.
The accused Kalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in the New York federal case in 1953 at Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of participating in spying during the Soviet Union’s Cold War two years ago.
The couple of Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, during days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the officials that he was inspired to take the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested permission to release the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He rejected 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that it was "very naturally dissatisfied" about the decision of the accusation.
"We believe that the intention to impose the death penalty instead of accepting the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only extend the injury caused to all parties involved," explained Paton.
Saipova's defense team has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member announces that Breksita's negotiating leadership should be entrusted to NAIDŽEL FARAS
Nigel Faraž's protest promised today to "mobilize the nation's army" at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independent Party stated that politicians should feel the anger of the Eurosceptics when one of the Members of the Teresa Mée Parliament proposed that the negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a member of the conservative line, said that Britain would have gone out a long time ago if Mr Faraža had been a minister of Brext.
However, the challenge that Mrs Meejo will have to face in trying to unify the pro-controversial party, was demonstrated by the conservatives who supported the continuation of the EU and joined a separate city protest against Breksit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan on the future relationship between the British and the European Union (Chequers Compromise) and is experiencing attacks on those who want to leave the EU, on those who want to remain in the EU, and also on the EU itself.
They insisted that she would be determined to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a negative response, and would make Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between her offer and Haosu.
Mr Bouna, Leave Means Leave, announced that he wanted to throw away the Mee Plan in the fertilizer (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Faraāža an ally and to entrust him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been to the saying, we would have already stopped," Boun declared.
Mr Wellingborough, a Member of Parliament from Wellingborough, added: 'I will support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Mate Plan!'
Based on his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to have bags!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumption that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is absolutely false'.
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexita, also took part in the route, and said to the reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all their work and wish us.
Please refuse Chequers and start listening."
She added, "The Prime Minister remains in his place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the house should feel pressure if they are going not to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They are trying to hand over Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow it to be done."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd, he adds: "I want you to let our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and never let us relax until we are independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remaining steps were made through Birmingham before a two - hour - long settlement took place in the city center.
Unknown activists congratulated conservatives against Breksita's banners after the group meeting this weekend.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, was embellishing the Conservatives about the security issues they faced at the beginning of the party's application conference.
"These are the people who claim to us that they are able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, an undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Bretty," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of the World Champion after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetel.
From the moment Walter Botas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that Mercedes’s team work will play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Botswana started well and almost left Hamilton on dry, defending his place in the first two trips and called Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fette first entered the garage and left Hamilton invading to deal with the rest, it was likely decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled the circle later and fell back from Fetel, but Hamilton continued to stand in the leaders after balancing forces, which saw Ferrari’s driver leave the inside unhappily, risking to leave behind after a double manevre to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the rear row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge of a large part of the race, because he focused on tires to quickly reach the finish and accommodate Kim Raikonen fourth.
After all, he arrived in the 44th round in the garage, but he could not increase the speed in the remaining eight circles, because Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walters did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Tramps, at his Saturday night's meeting, played the senator Diana Feinstein for her perseverance not to express her perseverance with the letter from Christine Blake Ford, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno, of sexual harassment.
Talking at Western Virginia, the President did not specifically talk about the Forda Certificate that it gave to the Senate's legal commission, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, unpleasant and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the past few days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, unmerciful and unbelieving people," he said.
"When you read press releases and flooded information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diāna Feinstein, did you catch the information?
Remember her answer to the question... Did you open the document? - "Oh, what did it do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein, which explains in detail what Forda accused Kaveno, and at the beginning of September the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denies that it would have happened in her office.
"I don't hide Dr Forda's accusations, I "not blew" her story, " Feinstein said to the Commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it."
But her denial did not like the President, who commented on the situation at the Saturday evening: 'I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Perhaps she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that democrats use accusations for their good.
"They are purposefully disposed to recover power by any means."
Do you see evil, interference, they don't care what they're hurting, what they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the President said.

The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during the earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he sacrificed himself to bring hundreds of passengers out of land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing the tsunami.
The territory continues to be heavily followed by dunes, and many are trapped in mud in Pala.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavain Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu Airport, which was strongly slump.
He stayed in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, would be safe in the air.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking that it could collapse.
Later in the hospital he died.
A representative of Indonesia's air navigation, Johannes Sirarat, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the reports of Australia's ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kaliman, to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're really upset when we hear it," he's filled.
Meanwhile, the public authorities are concerned that thousands of deaths could be reached, the public disaster prevention agency claims access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangago (Boutong) is limited.
"It is likely that the beauty will grow, because many more people's bodies are under the ruins, as well as many cannot get access," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The 6 - foot [6 m] city destroyed Pala, where mass funerals would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes shall continue to provide assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, Sky News said: "A minute's quick medical service brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops everywhere are reloaded."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is about to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but all this can get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo came to Pala and said to the military import of the country: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" the CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombard, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Now Air Newgini says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia fell on board and now claims that one of the people had disappeared, even though he had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
The airline Air Naugini announced the press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not answer for one of the passengers — a man.
The airline announced that she cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find a missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on passengers, such as his age and nationality.
Local residents with boats helped save other passengers and crew after the aircraft fell into the water trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials, on Friday, said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline stated that six people were staying in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Naval reports that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the runway length had been changed on board.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It was really good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to escape from the sinking plane by means of emergency exits, because the water was only in the middle.
He said that the steiarts fell into panic and shouted, as well as that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the quay also helped with lifesaving work by means of an inflatable boat to bring people on the shore before the plane falls about 30 feet (100 ft) under the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG aircraft companies in the last twenty years, and no one is related to Air Newgini.
The psychoanalytic commentator explains the event of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the appeal provided evidence in the repeated case, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, a psychoanalyzer of the Department of Judicial Examination in the United States, showed several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from his phone to put together the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Telis and 19 - year - old inmate Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said that he had received location data from several phones, which showed that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous statements, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at the time of Chambers, when he claimed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went for a visit to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford at the courtroom showed that he was not in town on that day.
When he asked if Telis told the truth, saying he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he's lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rovlet said that a little after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
"He deleted him from his life," said Heil.
The defence is expected to provide its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the procedure to be passed on to the jury later on the same day.

Black again?
In New York, the whirlwind sued a couple for dismissal after receiving "racist" messages
In New York City, she sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a false text message from a mother who complained that she "has been black again."
The couple denys that there would be a race, comparing the trial to the "expression".
Lindsija Plasko-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her negative attitude in finding that the new childcareer, Gizele Mauris, is black when she came to work the first day in 2016.
"NEGATIVE, ATTHELE," Plasko-Flaksman wrote to his husband in a text.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurize, and twice.
In an illustration of their inactivity, the "samulsus" Plasco-Flakesman's discount in Maurice, pointing out that their previous alumni, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maurize paid for her one working day and sent her home with Uber.
Now Maurice sued the court by claiming compensation for the dismissal and seeking to receive $ 350 a day for six months of work with secured living, to which she initially applied, without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said in Post on Friday, adding "I know that it is discrimination."
A couple rejects the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the termination of Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after her insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think to say.
She's not a racer.
We're not races," Joel Plasko said, "Post."
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated in a rude way, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
As the trial was compared to the "expression", Plasco said that his wife had been born a little only two months ago and was in a very "critical situation".
"You really treat someone in this way?
This is not an acceptable action," said the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are still in place, public opinion is quickly over the social networks by denying them about their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a speaking bear
Bonda's daughter, Carena Jenckel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in some shoes" who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very surprising now to learn what we know about the great success of Paddington."
When she said that her father, who had worked as a operator of BBC before having felt inspiration to write a book on a little toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "salden bitter" after the father's departure into eternity last year.
Talking about Paddington, who she calls "a very important member of the family", her father was silently proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like if you had a child who reached something: you are proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Even though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to get my dying daughter on my phone
After her humiliation, her daughter quickly took her to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"No one called regularly and said that he was very bad and expected she would not survive," said Edna-Laperuz.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying she'll die in the next two minutes, and I have to get out of her.
And I did it.
I said, "Then, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even faster and it all ended now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that everything was happening.
I could not catch or scream because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to control."
After all, then already a daughter's loss grieving, Edna-Laperuz boarded a plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and tears went all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Sleeve women attach cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whom loved ones have committed suicide take action to help others not to take their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey strengthen the cards at the Wellsh bridge with an inspiring message and telephone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davis’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he became depressed, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any elder to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davies, 45 years old in Lydnia, said that her son was a promising chef with a sedition.
"Everyone recognized him by smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "delighted" always and everywhere."
But he refused to work before he died because he was "very, very dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at that time. was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have consequences."
Davis created cards, "to tell you there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence -- you have to talk."
Hamphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, his spouse for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or would be depressed or in any other sense," she said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
His death was a major injury to children, but they have to deal with it: "It irritates the whole family.
That's what we're doing.
But we all need to continue and fight."

Brita Kaven's future is hanging in the air, as FBI is starting an investigation
"I think that if we could actually get what he requires, in terms of time and scope, a limited investigation – we could achieve a little consensus," Fleik said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "participating" between the intimidated partisans.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republic not want the FBI to investigate?
Their detention is just a coincidence.
The interim elections are in five weeks’ time, on 6 November — if, as is expected, the Republicns will suffer badly, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senators, lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans, and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, vice-president, decide the vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of political asylum seekers in North Korea 'cut down' by Kima's leadership
The number of political asylum seekers in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jongs came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the Ministry of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers compared with 2011, when they were 2706.
Park said that stricter border controls are key factors for North Korea and China and for the high rates of human smuggling.
Pyongyang did not submit any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that over 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most travels through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely guarded Demilitarianisation Zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and deports them as forced.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically ward, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This was the result of a historic meeting between US President Donald Trampus and Kim Jongun Singapore when, on large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of sanctions since these negotiations failed to progress.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances, we shall in no case stand the first one," said Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretu Kaveno "historic" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Court, named the candidate of the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno as "historic" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court on account of his temperament.
Pelosi commented at the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Ostin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "historic," said Pelos about her response to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Bleigh Ford when they were both teenagers.
In its initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and teaching, talking about her family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democrats in the Commission by making known the charges against him for the destruction of the 'armes and concerted nature' organised by the liberals, who are angry at the loss of the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kaveno's testimony was a basis for being unable to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and treatment as he is addressing the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
The Pelosi objected when she asked whether she would try to question Kaveno if she were approved and if the Democrats were to acquire a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he is not suitable for a post not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in an existing workplace in court," said Pelosi.
Kaveno, now, is a judge at the Washington District Appeals Court.
Pelosi was added to say that, as a democrat, is worried about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Type, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno surrounded questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Not a suitable moment to work in court with a hysteric and double-cosist man, but we expect to be happy to say, "Is it not wonderful?" said Pelosi.
But women must keep their hands.
It's denunciation, for months and years everything has come "over the edges", but she's not allowed to get it all out of her weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinoma, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, how do you think?"
She continued, "I was once very helped by a woman who was the manager of a company who said that she also wept when she was angry, but built a technique — when she became angry and began to weep, he told the person with whom he talked: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great."
Asparas are only partially recognised as a form of anger discharge because they are misunderstood in the very foundations.
One of my most vivid memories is that of the older male part, when I wept once because of the perplexed anger of an older woman who was caught behind me — a persistent leader (women) from whom I was always a bit afraid to take me to a ladder space.
"Never let them see that weep!" she told me.
"They don't know you've read.
They think you're upset and they're just gonna be happy that you've been able to 'slash under the skin'.
Patricia Schreeder, then the American Congress of Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his election to the post of President of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in extramarital relations, left a ship, also called "silent making" and withdrew from the elections, Schreeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not stand for the post of President.
"It wasn't a carefully thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to find another.
There were those who called it "Snow White and seven types."
She was late in the campaign, abandoned her money and promised she would not take part in the elections unless two million US dollars were collected.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated 1,000 dollars to men’s representatives, donated only $250.
"Do they think I got discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not take a formal campaign in her speech, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, to be disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to collect money and speak to voters rather than to delegate, and angry about sex — in which she was "populated".
"You would think I had a nerve collapse," said Schreeder in his memory of how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think "Kleenex" was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tomb.
"She wept."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War can be beneficial Beijing
The main excuses about how the trade war between the US and China began are hidden and while the fight does not end, differences between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Tramps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week with new rates that affect the value of the unit's $200 billion ($150 billion) by immediately placing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also responds "big" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of American goods worth 60 billion.
China has announced that it is committed to respond to the US alone and that it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second biggest economy could be mentioned.
Washington would have to meet certain demands, but it would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Siji Jinynpin to be publicly knocked in the US.
However, experts say that when Beijing plays its cards correctly, US trade war pressure can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a political decision has been made quickly, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrolled economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than previously recognised by observers," said Abigeila Greissa, "New American Security" researcher who focuses on Asia.
Syria is a "gatava" for the return of refugees, announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria claims that it is ready for voluntary reception of refugees and calls for help in restoring a country that has been affected by the war for more than seven years.
When speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid Almalam said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the destroyed areas of terrorism in their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN assumes that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almalam said that the Syrian regime would accept help in the reconstruction of the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the state would not accept the help of conditions or assistance from the countries that helped to sponsor the unrest.
European golf team sensitisingly wins the Raidera Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raidera Cup by overcoming the US sample with a score of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in Europe and has not obtained the Raidera Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its cup when a team led by the random Danish Thomas Bjorn got 14,5 points that were needed to exaggerate the US sample.
The U.S. star Phil Mikelson, who was hard to go all the tournaments, caught his T-cotch in the water at the 16th beard of the S.C.E., standing in the match at Franzsko Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined at all its stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to get the 5-0-0 result since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
The American Jordan Spintas with 5 to 4 sensationally lost European teams, at the rating of the lowest player Torbjornnam Olesenam from Denmark.
World's best player, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, to whom this was probably the last Raidera Cup.
The eight Raidera Cup Veterans, the Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the tournament's best player from Europe with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do tears."
This was a heavy year.
I am truly grateful to Thomas that he raised me and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we have regained the cup.
It's a team's merit and I'm glad that I could help," Garcia made an emotional comment on the European victories.
He goes on to give his fellowman John Rama, who won the US golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 single-games.
"It's the pride that I feel by winning Taiger Woods, I grow up following the course of this player," said the young Rams 23 years old.
Woods lost his four match in France and now he has a career record with a cup of 13-21-3 Raidera.
No statistics were found for one of the best players ever who won the top 14 golf tournaments as the second behind Jack Niss.
The U.S. team fought all weekends to find its opportunities, with the exception of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf courses throughout the tournament.
The U.S. sample captain Jim Furick said after his team's unsatisfactory performance: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to put a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players took a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raidera Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to get your hats.
We were won."
Latest news about red traffic: Concentration decreases in Pinella, Manatee and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Fauna (FWC) indicates a reduction in the overall red lairage concentration in the Gulf of Tampa area.
According to FWC, flowering spots have been reported in Pinella, Manat, Sarasot, Charlote, and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of the red twilight stretches about 130 miles from North China to the South on the coast of the region.
Plans can be found about 10 miles from the maritime coastal area of the Hillsborough area, but in some places it takes about a week.
The Red Pasco area is also closed.
In the last week, moderate concentrations have been reported in the Pineella area or in its coastal area, low to high levels in the maritime area of the Hilsbor area, low to high levels in the Manatian area, low to high levels in the Sarastian area or its coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the region of Sharlote, low to high levels in the Lee area or its coastal area, and low levels in the kloje area.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in the areas of Pineale, Manati, Sarasot, Lee and Kolier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in the North West in Florida last week.
